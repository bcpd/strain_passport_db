12552915		[Immobilization of penicilin G acylase on polyacrylonitrile fiber].	The immobilization of Penicillin G Acylase from Bacillus megaterium by glutaraldehyde crosslinking on the partially acid-hydrolyed polyacrylonitrile fiber was studied. When the amount of--NH2 on fiber were 690 mumol/g and the moisture in the fiber was 64%, and the content of enzyme protein immobilized on fiber was more than 100 mg/g. The activity of 2300 IU/g was obtained with 30% of overall yield and 56% of binding efficiency. The immobilization yield was markedly influenced by ratio of the amount of free enzyme used to the weight of the fiber. The half-life of storage stability of immobilized PGA at room temperature was 130 days. The immobilized PGA kept 80% of the initial activity after 20 cycles of operation in 10% of PGK(W/V) in 0.05 mol/L phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 degrees C and an enzyme load of 150 IU/g(PGK) and 10 g(PGK) for per cycle of operation. The hydrolysis conversion of PGK in the range of 2.5%-12.5% (W/V) were over 98% for the immobilized PGA.

12549090		[Composition and structure of bioflocculant BP25].	A strain of Bacillus megaterium screened from activated sludge could produce exocellular flocculant. The flocculant was purified through ethanol precipitation and Sephadex S-500 column chromatography. The purified flocculant BP25 was assayed by Bradford reaction, agarose gel electrophoresis and Sulfate-phenol method. The results showed that BP25 was a kind of polysaccharide which contains 36.97% O, 6.28% H, 47.00% C, 0% No NMR assay showed BP-25 contains no uronic acid. Gas-chromatography assay combined with thin-layer chromatography of acid hydralate revealed that BP25 contains Glucose and Mannose with the mole ratio of 4:1. Methylation analysis revealed the polysaccharide contains alpha-1, 6 glycosidicbond and alpha-1, 3 glycosidicbond. The main chains are comprised of Glucose and all the Mannose are in the side chains. Possible repeating unit structure was deduced.	2004	8	10	Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica	Bacillus megaterium; Flocculation; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Glucose; Mannose; Methylation; Polysaccharides, Bacterial; Sewage	Liu	Z
12549027		[Studies on the immobilized penicillin acylase on polymer beads].	The extracellular penicillin acylase from Bacillus megaterium was immobilized on oxirane group of Eupergit C beads. The apparent activity of the immobilized enzyme was about 1400 u.g-1 (dry weight). The optimal pH and temperature were 8.0 and 55 degrees C for hydrolytic reaction of penicillin G, respectively. The immobilized enzyme was stable in the pH range of 6.0-8.5 and at temperature below 45 degrees C. The apparent Michaelis constant for penicillin G was inhibition constant of phenylacetic acid as competitive 2 x 10(-2) mol.L-1 and Vm was 1.33 mmol.g-1 min-1 (dry weight) at 37 degrees C and PH8.0. The inhibitor and 6-APA as non-competitive inhibitor were 2.8 x 10(-2) mol.L-1 and 0.125 mol.L-1 for the immobilized enzyme at pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. The remained activity of the immobilized enzyme was about 80% after operating 200 times for hydrolysis of penicillin G to 6-APA, and the average yield of 6-APA was 89.48%.	2004	8	10	Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica	Bacillus megaterium; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes, Immobilized; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Penicillin Amidase; Penicillin G; Polymers; Temperature	Han	H

11963881	10.1385/abab:91-93:1-9:515	Production of polyhydroxybutyrate by Bacillus species isolated from municipal activated sludge.	Plastic wastes are considered to be severe environmental contaminants causing waste disposal problems. Widespread use of biodegradable plastics is one of the solutions, but it is limited by high production cost. Biologic wastewater treatment generates large quantities of biomass as activated sludge. Only a few reports focus on the potential of utilizing resident Bacillus species from activated sludge in polyhydroxbutyrate (PHB) production as well as the production of PHB from food wastes. They have attractive properties such as short generation time, absence of endotoxins, and secretion of both amylases and proteinases that can well utilize food wastes for nutrients, which can further reduce the cost of production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). Two PHA-producing strains, HF-1 and HF-2, were isolated from activated sludge. HF-1 outperformed HF-2 in terms of growth and PHB production in hydrolyzed soy and malt wastes. The isolated bacteria was characterized by DNA sequence alignment.

Bacteria were isolated from damaged mural paintings of the Servilia tomb (necropolis of Carmona, Seville, Spain). Selected strains, representative for different clusters of isolates with similar fatty acid profiles, were analysed by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Bacillus is the dominant genus among the isolates: members of the rRNA species complexes of B. megaterium, B. pumilus and B. firmus were found as well as several other Bacillus species. One group of halotolerant isolates falls in the Bacillus sensu lato group, with closest relatedness to the genera Salibacillus and Virgibacillus. Other genera found are Artbrobacter, Micrococcus, Streptomyces, Sphingomonas, Paenibacillus, and a genus closely related to Paracraurococcus. Many isolates showed low 16S rDNA sequence similarities with the closest related database entries, a strong indication for the presence of several new species among the isolates.	2002	7	12	Syst Appl Microbiol	Systematic and applied microbiology	Biodegradation, Environmental; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Paintings; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Spain	Heyrman	J
11722930	10.1128/AEM.67.12.5735-5739.2001	Engineering cytochrome P450 BM-3 for oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.	Cytochrome P450 BM-3, a self-sufficient P450 enzyme from Bacillus megaterium that catalyzes the subterminal hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids, has been engineered into a catalyst for the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The activities of a triplet mutant (A74G/F87V/L188Q) towards naphthalene, fluorene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, and 9-methylanthracene were 160, 53, 109, 287, and 22/min, respectively. Compared with the activities of the wild type towards these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, those of the mutant were improved by up to 4 orders of magnitude. The coupling efficiencies of the mutant towards naphthalene, fluorene, acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, and 9-methylanthracene were 11, 26, 5.4, 15, and 3.2%, respectively, which were also improved several to hundreds fold. The high activities of the mutant towards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons indicate the potential of engineering P450 BM-3 for the biodegradation of these compounds in the environment.	2002	3	4	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Escherichia coli; Genetic Engineering; Mutation; Oxidation-Reduction; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons	Li	Q S
11720522	10.1021/np010238g	Microbial transformations of p-coumaric acid by Bacillus megaterium and Curvularia lunata.	p-Coumaric acid (1) is an abundant phenolic natural product that exhibits both chemoprotectant and antioxidant properties. Microbial transformation screening studies showed that 1 was converted to 4-vinylphenol (4), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (2), caffeic acid (5), protocatechuic acid (6), and other unidentified metabolites over 144 h. 4-Vinylphenol (4) and its dimer, (2R,2S)-4-(2,3-dihydro-5-hyroxy-2-benzofuranyl) phenol (11), were produced by Bacillus megaterium, and 5-[(E)-2-carboxyethenyl]-2,3-dihydro-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-benzofurancarboxylic acid (15) and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (2) were produced by Curvularia lunata. On the basis of deuterium-labeling experiments, B. megaterium catalyzes the nonoxidative enzymatic tautomerization of 1 to a vinylogous beta-keto acid intermediate that decarboxylates to 4. The presence of peroxidase and laccase activities in C. lunata extracts suggests that these enzymes may be involved in one-electron, p-coumaric acid dimerization in this organism.	2002	1	14	J Nat Prod	Journal of natural products	Bacillus megaterium; Biotransformation; Catalysis; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Chromatography, Thin Layer; Coumaric Acids; Dimerization; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Laccase; Mass Spectrometry; Mitosporic Fungi; Molecular Structure; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Oxidoreductases; Peroxidase; Stereoisomerism	Torres Y Torres	J L
11716209	10.1078/0944-5013-00104	Production of PHB by a Bacillus megaterium strain using sugarcane molasses and corn steep liquor as sole carbon and nitrogen sources.	Poly(hydroxybutyric acid) (PHB) and other biodegradable polyesters are promising candidates for the development of environment-friendly, totally biodegradable plastics. The use of cane molasses and corn steep liquor, two of the cheapest substrates available in Egypt, may help to reduce the cost of producing such biopolyesters. In this work, the effect of different carbon sources was studied. Maximum production of PHB was obtained with cane molasses and glucose as sole carbon sources (40.8, 39.9 per mg cell dry matter, respectively). The best growth was obtained with 3% molasses, while maximum yield of PHB (46.2% per mg cell dry matter) was obtained with 2% molasses. Corn steep liquor was the best nitrogen source for PHB synthesis (32.7 mg per cell dry matter), on the other hand, best growth was observed when ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate, ammonium oxalate or ammonium phosphate were used as nitrogen sources.	2002	5	10	Microbiol Res	Microbiological research	Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Carbohydrates; Environmental Pollution; Hydroxybutyrates; Microscopy, Electron; Molasses; Nitrogen Compounds; Polyesters; Zea mays	Gouda	M K
11695888	10.1021/bi010716m	Phenylalanine 393 exerts thermodynamic control over the heme of flavocytochrome P450 BM3.	Site-directed mutants of the phylogenetically conserved phenylalanine residue F393 were constructed in flavocytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium. The high degree of conservation of this residue in the P450 superfamily and its proximity to the heme (and its ligand Cys400) infers an essential role in P450 activity. Extensive kinetic and thermodynamic characterization of mutant enzymes F393A, F393H, and F393Y highlighted significant differences from wild-type P450 BM3. All enzymes expressed to high levels and contained their full complement of heme. While the reduction and subsequent treatment of the mutant P450s with carbon monoxide led to the formation of the characteristic P450 spectra in all cases, the absolute position of the Soret absorption varied across the series WT/F393Y (449 nm), F393H (445 nm), and F393A (444 nm).

11689105	10.1177/108705710100600207	Cost-effective whole-cell assay for laboratory evolution of hydroxylases in Escherichia coli.	Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium catalyzes the subterminal hydroxylation of medium- and longchain fatty acids at the omega-1, omega-2, and omega-3 positions. A continuous spectrophotometric assay for P450 BM-3 based on the conversion of p-nitrophenoxycarboxylic acids (pNCA) to omega-oxycarboxylic acids and the chromophore p-nitrophenolate was reported recently. However, this pNCA assay procedure contained steps that limited its application in high throughput screening, including expression of P450 BM-3 variant F87A in 4-ml cultures, centrifugation, resuspension of the cell pellet, and cell lysis. We have shown that permeabilization of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli DH5alpha with polymyxin B sulfate, EDTA, polyethylenimine, or sodium hexametaphosphate results in rapid conversion of 12-pNCA. A NADPH-generating system consisting of NADP(+), D/L-isocitric acid, and the D/L-isocitrate dehydrogenase of E. coli DH5alpha reduced the cofactor expense more than 10-fold.

11600046	10.1021/jf010563+	Regulation of phenobarbital-mediated induction of CYP102 (cytochrome P450(BM-3)) in Bacillus megaterium by phytochemicals from soy and green tea.	Cytochrome P450 102 (CYP102 or Cytochrome P450(BM)(-)(3)) is induced in Bacillus megaterium by barbiturates, perioxisome proliferators, estrogen, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. We have previously demonstrated that a CYP102 construct (BMC 143) coupled with a luciferase reporter gene can be used to identify the inducers of CYP102. We now describe the effect of added phytochemicals on the induction of CYP102 by phenobarbital (PB) in B. megaterium. The isoflavones genistein, biochanin A, coumestrol, and equol, the green tea flavanoid epicatechin, and the fungal toxin zearalenone inhibit the induction of CYP102 by PB in a dose-dependent manner. However, the isoflavone daidzein, the phytoalexin glyceollin, and catechin, an epimer of epicatechin, failed to exhibit a similar inhibitory effect on PB-mediated CYP102 induction.	2001	12	5	J Agric Food Chem	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Catechin; Chromans; Coumestrol; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Equol; Genistein; Isoflavones; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Phenobarbital; Soybeans; Tea; Zearalenone	Rajnarayanan	R V
11598083	10.1128/IAI.69.11.7074-7082.2001	agr expression precedes escape of internalized Staphylococcus aureus from the host endosome.	Staphylococcus aureus is a versatile pathogen capable of causing life-threatening infections. Many of its cell wall and exoproduct virulence determinants are controlled via the accessory gene regulator (agr). Although considered primarily as an extracellular pathogen, it is now recognized that S. aureus can be internalized by epithelial and endothelial cells. Traditional experimental approaches to investigate bacterial internalization are extremely time-consuming and notoriously irreproducible. We present here a new reporter gene method to assess intracellular growth of S. aureus in MAC-T cells that utilizes a gfp-luxABCDE reporter operon under the control of the Bacillus megaterium xylA promoter, which in S. aureus is expressed in a growth-dependent manner. This facilitates assessment of the growth of internalized bacteria in a nondestructive assay. The dual gfp-lux reporter cassette was also evaluated as a reporter of agr expression and used to monitor the temporal induction of agr d	2001	12	5	Infect Immun	Infection and immunity	Acyltransferases; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Cattle; Cell Line; Endocytosis; Endosomes; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Engineering; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Luminescent Proteins; Molecular Structure; Operon; Oxidoreductases; Staphylococcus aureus; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors	Qazi	S N

The bacterial rhizosphere communities of three host plants of the pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae, field-grown strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), were analyzed. We aimed to determine the degree to which the rhizosphere effect is plant dependent and whether this effect would be increased by growing the same crops in two consecutive years. Rhizosphere or soil samples were taken five times over the vegetation periods. To allow a cultivation-independent analysis, total community DNA was extracted from the microbial pellet recovered from root or soil samples. 16S rDNA fragments amplified by PCR from soil or rhizosphere bacterium DNA were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DGGE fingerprints showed plant-dependent shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial populations in the rhizosphere which became more pronounced in the second year.

Forty-seven strains representing 14 different Bacillus species isolated from clinical and food samples were grown in reconstituted infant milk formulae (IMF) and subsequently assessed for adherence to, invasion of, and cytotoxicity toward HEp-2 and Caco-2 cells. Cell-free supernatant fluids from 38 strains (81%) were shown to be cytotoxic, 43 strains (91%) adhered to the test cell lines, and 23 strains (49%) demonstrated various levels of invasion. Of the 21 Bacillus cereus strains examined, 5 (24%) were invasive. A larger percentage of clinically derived Bacillus species (20%) than of similar species tested from the food environment were invasive. Increased invasion occurred after growth of selected Bacillus species in reconstituted IMF containing glucose.

The antimicrobial effects of 30 trifluoromethyl ketones [1-30] were studied on various representative bacteria. Of the ketones, 4,4,4-trifluoro-1-phenyl-1,3-butanedione [10], 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-(4,5-dimethyloxazol-2-yl)-2-propanone [11] and 1-(2-benzoxazolyl)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-propanone [18] were found to exhibit potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium and Corynebacterium michiganese, but not against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens. Compounds 11 and 18 inhibited the Escherichia coli. Compound 18 was also effective against yeasts. The combination of promethazine with 18 was significantly synergistic against E. coli strains, especially the proton pump deficient mutant. The results suggest that membrane transporters are the target of trifluoromethyl ketones. The inhibition was more marked in the proton pump deficient E. coli mutant than in the wild type, which suggested that the antibacterial effect of triflu	2001	12	4	Int J Antimicrob Agents	International journal of antimicrobial agents	Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacteria; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Drug Synergism; Fungi; HIV-1; Humans; Ketones; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Promethazine	Kawase	M

The bamM gene from Bacillus megaterium DSM319 encoding an extracellular beta-amylase was isolated and completely sequenced. Chromosomal inactivation by deletion mutagenesis resulted in total loss of amylolytic activity, indicative of a single starch-degrading enzyme. Functional characterization of the expressed protein revealed a maltogenic enzyme exhibiting optimal activities at pH 7.5 and 50 degrees C. Amylase expression is subject to catabolite repression by glucose. A putative cis-acting catabolite-responsive element (CRE) was identified; it is located within the bamM coding region, matching the position of the predicted signal peptide processing site. Base substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis within the bamM-CRE--retaining unchanged the amino acid sequence--provoked a remarkable relief from carbon catabolite repression (CCR), thereby proving functionality of the CRE for CCR.	2001	12	20	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus megaterium; Base Sequence; Carbon; Cloning, Molecular; Enzyme Repression; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Response Elements; beta-Amylase	Lee	J S

The aim of this work was to compare the chemical structure of the spore cortex of a range of species, and to determine any correlation between cortex structure and spore resistance properties. The fine chemical structure of the cortex of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium botulinum was examined by muropeptide analysis using reverse phase HPLC. There is a conserved basic structure between peptidoglycan of these species, with the only difference being the level of de-N-acetylation of an amino sugar. In order to determine if an alteration in cortex structure correlates with heat resistance properties, the peptidoglycan structure and properties of B. subtilis spores prepared under different conditions were compared. Peptidoglycan from spores prepared in Nutrient Broth (NB) showed reduction in single L-alanine substituted muramic acid to only 13.9% compared with 20.6% in CCY-grown spores.

We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli.

Each contamination load was studied by adding the specified number of spores to 100 vials containing nutrient broth and exposing them to various doses of gamma radiation. Curves representing the number of contaminated vials against the dose of radiation were sigmoidal in shape and the data showed an indirect relationship. Data were analysed by regression analysis which revealed a significant correlation (R2=0.85).

11427964	10.1002/yea.728	Kluyveromyces lactis cytoplasmic plasmid pGKL2: heterologous expression of Orf3p and proof of guanylyltransferase and mRNA-triphosphatase activities.	The predicted ORF3 polypeptide (Orf3p) of the linear genetic element pGKL2 from Kluyveromyces lactis was expressed in Bacillus megaterium as a fusion protein with a His(6X)-tag at the C-terminus for isolation by Ni-affinity chromatography. This is the first time that a yeast cytoplasmic gene product has been expressed heterologously as a functional protein in a bacterial system. The purified protein was found to display both RNA 5'-triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities. When the lysine residue present at position 177 of the protein within the sequence motif (KXDG), highly conserved in capping enzymes and other nucleotidyl transferases, was substituted by alanine, the guanylyltransferase activity was lost, thereby proving an important role for the transfer of GMP from GTP to the 5'-diphosphate end of the mRNA. Our in vitro data provides the first direct evidence that the polypeptide encoded by ORF3 of the cytoplasmic yeast plasmid pGKL2 functions as a plasmid-specific cappin	2002	7	17	Yeast	Yeast (Chichester, England)	Acid Anhydride Hydrolases; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Escherichia coli; Fungal Proteins; Genes, Fungal; Guanosine Monophosphate; Kluyveromyces; Mutation; Nucleotidyltransferases; Open Reading Frames; Plasmids; RNA Caps; RNA, Fungal; RNA, Messenger; Recombinant Proteins; Transcription, Genetic	Tiggemann	M
11418564	10.1128/JB.183.14.4235-4243.2001	PhaC and PhaR are required for polyhydroxyalkanoic acid synthase activity in Bacillus megaterium.	Polyhydroxyalkanoic acids (PHAs) are a class of polyesters stored in inclusion bodies and found in many bacteria and in some archaea. The terminal step in the synthesis of PHA is catalyzed by PHA synthase. Genes encoding this enzyme have been cloned, and the primary sequence of the protein, PhaC, is deduced from the nucleotide sequences of more than 30 organisms. PHA synthases are grouped into three classes based on substrate range, molecular mass, and whether or not there is a requirement for phaE in addition to the phaC gene product. Here we report the results of an analysis of a PHA synthase that does not fit any of the described classes. This novel PHA synthase from Bacillus megaterium required PhaC (PhaC(Bm)) and PhaR (PhaR(Bm)) for activity in vivo and in vitro. PhaC(Bm) showed greatest similarity to the PhaCs of class III in both size and sequence. Unlike those in class III, the 40-kDa PhaE was not required, and furthermore, the 22-kDa PhaR(Bm) had no obvious homology to PhaE.

The asymmetric reduction of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((S)-CHBE) was investigated. Escherichia coli cells expressing both the carbonyl reductase (S1) gene from Candida magnoliae and the glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) gene from Bacillus megaterium were used as the catalyst. In an organic-solvent-water two-phase system, (S)-CHBE formed in the organic phase amounted to 2.58 M (430 g/l), the molar yield being 85%. E. coli transformant cells coproducing S1 and GDH accumulated 1.25 M (208 g/l) (S)-CHBE in an aqueous monophase system by continuously feeding on COBE, which is unstable in an aqueous solution. In this case, the calculated turnover of NADP+ (the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) to CHBE was 21,600 mol/mol. The optical purity of the (S)-CHBE formed was 100% enantiomeric excess in both systems.

The molecular analysis of a genomic region of B. megaterium revealed the presence of a gene coding for the enzyme phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb). The enzyme activity was measured throughout the different phases of growth in B. megaterium, and its activity was found to be maximal in the late exponential growth phase. The branched amino acids isoleucine and valine activated Ptb expression. PtbBm was capable of using butyryl-CoA and 2-methyl-propionyl CoA as substrates. ActBm, a final sigma54 regulator from B. megaterium whose gene is situated upstream from the ptb gene, activated its expression.	2001	8	16	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Bacillus megaterium; Culture Media; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Kinetics; Phosphate Acetyltransferase; RNA Polymerase Sigma 54; Sigma Factor	Vazquez	G J

P450 monooxygenases from microorganisms, similar to those of eukaryotic mitochondria, display a rather narrow substrate specificity. For native P450 BM-3, no other substrates than fatty acids or an indolyl-fatty acid derivative have been reported (Li, Q.S., Schwaneberg, U., Fischer, P., Schmid, R.D., 2000. Directed evolution of the fatty-acid hydroxylase P450BM-3 into an indole-hydroxylating catalyst. Chem. Eur. J. 6 (9), 1531-1536).

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in activating the carcinogenicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in mammals, but they are also utilized by microorganisms for the degradation of these hazardous environmental contaminants. Wild-type CYP102 (P450(BM-3)) from Bacillus megaterium has low activity for the oxidation of the PAHs phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene. The double hydrophobic substitution R47L/Y51F at the entrance of the substrate access channel increased the PAH oxidation activity by up to 40-fold. Combining these mutations with the active site mutations F87A and A264G lead to order of magnitude increases in activity. Both these mutations increased the NADPH turnover rate, but the A264G mutation increased the coupling efficiency while the F87A mutation had dominant effects in product selectivity. Fast NADPH oxidation rates were observed (2250 min-1 for the R47L/Y51F/F87A mutant with phenanthrene) but the coupling efficiencies were relatively low (&lt; 13%)	2001	8	2	Eur J Biochem	European journal of biochemistry	Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxygen; Phenol; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Protein Binding; Protein Engineering; Quinones	Carmichael	A B
11356143	10.1042/0300-5127:0290147	Control of electron transfer in neuronal NO synthase.	The nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) are dimeric flavocytochromes consisting of an oxygenase domain with cytochrome P450-like Cys-ligated haem, coupled to a diflavin reductase domain, which is related to cytochrome P450 reductase. The NOSs catalyse the sequential mono-oxygenation of arginine to N-hydroxyarginine and then to citrulline and NO. The constitutive NOS isoforms (cNOSs) are regulated by calmodulin (CaM), which binds at elevated concentrations of free Ca(2+), whereas the inducible isoform binds CaM irreversibly. One of the main structural differences between the constitutive and inducible isoforms is an insert of 40-50 amino acids in the FMN-binding domain of the cNOSs. Deletion of the insert in rat neuronal NOS (nNOS) led to a mutant enzyme which binds CaM at lower Ca(2+) concentrations and which retains activity in the absence of CaM. In order to resolve the mechanism of action of CaM activation we determined reduction potentials for the FMN and FAD cofactors of rat nNOS in the	2001	9	6	Biochem Soc Trans	Biochemical Society transactions	Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Calmodulin; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Flavin Mononucleotide; Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide; Kinetics; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurons; Nitric Oxide; Nitric Oxide Synthase; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Rabbits; Rats; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Sequence Deletion; Structure-Activity Relationship	Daff	S

The single mutant F87A of cytochrome P-450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium was engineered by rational evolution to achieve improved hydroxylation activity for medium chain length substrates (C8-C10). Rational evolution combines rational design and directed evolution to overcome the drawbacks of these methods when applied individually. Based on the X-ray structure of the enzyme, eight mutation sites (P25, V26, R47, Y51, S72, A74, L188, and M354) were identified by modeling. Sublibraries created by site-specific randomization mutagenesis of each single site were screened using a spectroscopic assay based on omega-p-nitrophenoxycarboxylic acids (pNCA). The mutants showing activity for shorter chain length substrates were combined, and these combi-libraries were screened again for mutants with even better catalytic properties. Using this approach, a P-450 BM-3 variant with five mutations (V26T, R47F, A74G, L188K, and F87A) that efficiently hydrolyzes 8-pNCA was obtained.

Fungi and bacteria were isolated from surface disinfected leaf tissues of several citrus rootstocks. The principal bacterial species isolated were Alcaligenes sp., Bacillus spp. (including B. cereus, B. lentus, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. subtilis), Burkholderia cepacia, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter cloacae, Methylobacterium extorquens, and Pantoea agglomerans, with P. agglomerans and B. pumilus being the most frequently isolated species. The most abundant fungal species were Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Guignardia citricarpa, and Cladosporium sp. Genetic variability between 36 endophytic bacterial isolates was analysed by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, which indicated that B. pumilus isolates were more diverse than P. agglomerans isolates, although genetic diversity was not related to the host plants.

A rise of the intracellular serine proteinase activity (ISP) during postexponential growth of Bacillus subtilis was decreased by a temperature upshift from 35 degrees to 42 degrees C. However, the amount of both molecular forms of the major intracellular serine proteinase ISP1 determined by immunoblotting was similar at both temperatures or even slightly increased at 42 degrees C. The evolution of the ISP activity in B. megaterium showed an opposite temperature dependence, being faster during growth at 42 degrees C. The amount of immunologically detected ISP1 again did not correlate well with the enzyme activity. Moreover, most of the ISP1 molecules in cell-free extracts from B. megaterium were inactive and were activated by increasing the CaCl2 concentration up to 30 mM--unlike B. subtilis, where the enzymic activity was unaffected by Ca2+ concentration. These data suggest that the ISP1 activity in the two bacillar species during postexponential growth is regulated posttranscriptional	2001	7	19	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Antibodies, Bacterial; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Calcium; Culture Media; Cytoplasm; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzyme Activation; Heat-Shock Proteins; Osmotic Pressure; Serine Endopeptidases; Spores, Bacterial; Temperature	Kucerov..

An 18 633 bp region containing the replicon from the approximately 53 kb pBM400 plasmid of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 has been sequenced and characterized. This region contained a complete rRNA operon plus 10 other potential open reading frames (ORFs).

A 1.6 kb minimal replicon was defined and contained most of repM400. OrfB was shown to be required for stability. Three 12 bp identical tandem repeats were located within the coding region of repM400, and their presence on another plasmid caused incompatibility with their own cognate replicon. Nonsense, frameshift and deletion mutations in repM400 prevented replication, but each mutation could be complemented in trans.

The prophenoloxidase activating enzyme (ppA), a serine proteinase catalyzing the conversion of prophenoloxidase to an active phenoloxidase, has a molecular mass of about 36 kDa in its active form. This protein was cloned from a blood cell cDNA library and its corresponding cDNA of 1736 base pairs encodes a zymogenic protein (proppA) of 468 amino acids. An antibody raised against a synthetic peptide derived from a region of the cDNA sequence could efficiently inhibit the beta-1,3-glucan triggered activation of prophenoloxidase in vitro. The C-terminal half of the proppA is composed of a typical serine proteinase domain, with a sequence similar to other invertebrate and vertebrate serine proteinases. The N-terminal half contains a cationic glycine-rich domain, a cationic proline-rich domain and a clip-domain, in which the disulfide-bonding pattern is likely to be identical to those of the horseshoe crab big defensin and mammalian beta-defensins.

11173533	10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a002858	Crystal structure of glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium IWG3 at 1.7 A resolution.	The crystal structure of glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) from Bacillus megaterium IWG3 has been determined to an R-factor of 17.9% at 1.7 A resolution. The enzyme consists of four identical subunits, which are similar to those of other short-chain reductases/dehydrogenases (SDRs) in their overall folding and subunit architecture, although cofactor binding sites and subunit interactions differ. Whereas a pair of basic residues is well conserved among NADP(+)-preferring SDRs, only Arg39 was found around the adenine ribose moiety of GlcDH. This suggests that one basic amino acid is enough to determine the coenzyme specificity. The four subunits are interrelated by three mutually perpendicular diad axes (P, Q, and R). While subunit interactions through the P-axis for GlcDH are not so different from those of the other SDRs, those through the Q-axis differ significantly. GlcDH was found to have weaker hydrophobic interactions in the Q-interface.

Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is one of the most important enzymes for the production of semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics and their key intermediates. To enhance its expression, the PGA gene from Bacillus megaterium was amplified by PCR and subcloned into an expression vector under the control of the P43 promoter. The resulting construct was transferred into Bacillus subtilis WB600 and the transformant producing the most PGA was selected and designated SIBAS205. In contrast to the parent cells, which have to be induced by phenylacetic acid and cultured at 28 and 25 degrees C successively to produce PGA, the recombinant cells needed neither induction nor thermoregulation during fermentation at 37 degrees C.

12503878		L-amino acid oxidase from Trimeresurus jerdonii snake venom: purification, characterization, platelet aggregation-inducing and antibacterial effects.	An L-amino acid oxidase (LAO), designated as TJ-LAO, was purified to homogeneity from the venom of Trimeresurus jerdonii by Sephadex G-100 and Q Sepharose HP chromatography. The molecular weight of this enzyme was 110 kD as estimated by analytical gel filtration and was 55 kD by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting that the enzyme is composed of two subunits. The enzyme has an absorption spectrum characteristic of flavoproteins, containing 2 moles of FMN per mole of enzyme. The N-terminal sequence of TJ-LAO shares high homology with other viperid snake venom LAOs. Homology with elapid venom LAO is lower. TJ-LAO inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus megaterium. The antibacterial effect associated with LAO activity was elminated with the addition of catalase. Platelets in platelet-rich plasma aggregated upon the addition of TJ-LAO. The enzyme-induced aggregation was inhibited by catalase, suggesting formation o	2003	5	19	J Nat Toxins	Journal of natural toxins	Amino Acid Oxidoreductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Crotalid Venoms; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; L-Amino Acid Oxidase; Molecular Sequence Data; Platelet Aggregation; Rabbits; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Lu	Qiu-Min
12490319	10.1016/s0378-1119(02)01086-7	Characterization of two regulatory genes of the mercury resistance determinants from TnMERI1 by luciferase-based examination.	The broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposon, TnMERI1, of Bacillus megaterium strain MB1, contains three proposed operator/promoter (O/P) transcriptional start sites and two regulatory genes (merR1 and merR2). A series of luciferase (lux)-based transcriptional fusion plasmids were studied in Escherichia coli to show that both merR1 and merR2 gene products repressed transcription from O/PmerB3, O/PmerR1, and O/PmerR2 under uninduced conditions. Derepression occurred when the merR1 gene was present and Hg(2+) functioned as an inducer. In the presence of organomercurial compounds, basal transcription of merB3 was needed to produce inorganic Hg(2+) as the inducer of expression regulated by MerR1 at O/PmerB3. The presence of merR2 repressed transcription from all three O/Pmer sites under both non-induced conditions and when inorganic Hg(2+) or organomercurials were added. These results show that MerR1 functions as a repressor in the absence of Hg(2+) and as an activator in the presence 	2003	3	14	Gene	Gene	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation; Luciferases; Lyases; Mercury; Phenylmercuric Acetate; Plasmids; Protein Isoforms; Recombinant Fusion Proteins	Huang	Chieh Chen

The lipolytic system of Bacillus megaterium 370 was investigated, showing the existence of at least two secreted lipases and a cell-bound esterase. A gene coding for an extracellular lipase was isolated and cloned in Escherichia coli. The cloned enzyme displayed high activity on short to medium chain length (C(4)-C(8)) substrates, and poor activity on C(18) substrates. On the basis of amino acid sequence homology, the cloned lipase was classified into subfamily I.4 of bacterial lipases.	2003	3	28	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Genes, Bacterial; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lipase; Lipolysis	Ruiz	Cristian
12432959		Cross communication between components of carbon catabolite repression of Lactobacillus casei and Bacillus megaterium.	In low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is exerted by transcriptional regulation through a protein complex consisting of catabolite control protein CcpA and serine phosphorylated phosphocarrier protein HPr (HPr-ser-P). We investigated the interaction between these components of Lactobacillus casei and Bacillus megaterium. CcpA of L. casei could not complement a B. megaterium ccpA mutant strain, whereas it was found to be functional in Bacillus subtilis. To explore the nature of the non-complementing phenotype, we overproduced and purified CcpA and HPr of L. casei for in vitro analyses. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a failure in CCR signal transduction at the level of protein-protein interaction between L. casei CcpA and B. megateriumHPr-ser-P, while binding of CcpA to the B. megaterium target site was intact. We established a method based on surface plasmon resonance that allowed a quantitative analysis of CcpA/HPr-ser-P interactions.

12396916	10.3201/eid0810.020392	A two-component direct fluorescent-antibody assay for rapid identification of Bacillus anthracis.	A two-component direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) assay, using fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies specific to the Bacillus anthracis cell wall (CW-DFA) and capsule (CAP-DFA) antigens, was evaluated and validated for rapid identification of B. anthracis. We analyzed 230 B. anthracis isolates; 228 and 229 were positive by CW-DFA and CAP-DFA assays, respectively. We also tested 56 non-B. anthracis strains; 10 B. cereus and 2 B. thuringiensis were positive by the CW-DFA assay, and 1 B. megaterium strain was positive by CAP-DFA. Analysis of the combined DFA results identified 227 of 230 B. anthracis isolates; all 56 strains of the other Bacillus spp. were negative. Both DFA assays tested positive on 14 of 26 aging clinical specimens from the 2001 anthrax outbreak investigation. The two-component DFA assay is a sensitive, specific, and rapid confirmatory test for B. anthracis in cultures and may be useful directly on clinical specimens.	2002	12	27	Emerg Infect Dis	Emerging infectious diseases	Animals; Anthrax; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacillus anthracis; Bacterial Capsules; Cattle; Cell Wall; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Sensitivity and Specificity	De	Barun K
12395198	10.1007/s00438-002-0741-y	Identification and characterization of the non-PTS fru locus of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581.	A genetic locus that is adjacent to the gene encoding the small acid-soluble protein SASP C-4 of Bacillus megaterium has been identified. This locus, designated fru, contains a beta-fructosidase gene (fruA), a gene encoding a hydrophobic protein that is closely related to non-PTS sugar permeases of the proton symport type (fruP), and a gene coding for a transcriptional regulator of the LacI/GalR family (fruR). The FruA protein can hydrolyze sucrose and raffinose, but not maltose, isomaltose, trehalose, melibiose or lactose. The transcription initiation site of fruP has been mapped and the fruP promoter identified. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the FruR protein can bind specifically to a DNA fragment containing the fruP promoter region. DNase I footprinting analysis has defined the FruR binding site. Disruption of fruR led to high-level constitutive expression of fruPA, but had no effect on expression from the fruR promoter itself, indicating that FruR acts as a repressor of fru	2002	12	13	Mol Genet Genomics	Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Carbohydrates; Cloning, Molecular; Genes, Regulator; Glycoside Hydrolases; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Repressor Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Transcription Initiation Site; beta-Fructofuranosidase	Chiou	C-Y

Alanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.1), in the presence of NAD+, catalyzes the reversible deamination of L-alanine. Screening of alanine dehydrogenase in bacillus strains was carried out to develop its utilization as an industrial and analytical catalyst. Eight bacillus strains were used, including Bacillus megaterium LA 199 which abundantly produces enzymes. Alanine dehydrogenase was purified simply from Bacillus megaterium LA 199 by heat treatment at pH 5.4, followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sepharose CL-2B chromotography. The enzyme consisted of six subunits with an identical molecular mass of 42.5 kDa. The Km were 1.17 x 10(-2) mM for NADH and 5.12 x 10(-2) mM for pyruvate.	2003	4	9	Prep Biochem Biotechnol	Preparative biochemistry &amp; biotechnology	Alanine Dehydrogenase; Amino Acid Oxidoreductases; Bacillus; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Kinetics; NAD	Baysal	Senay Hamarat
12368811	10.1038/nbt744	Laboratory evolution of a soluble, self-sufficient, highly active alkane hydroxylase.	We have converted cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium (P450 BM-3), a medium-chain (C12-C18) fatty acid monooxygenase, into a highly efficient catalyst for the conversion of alkanes to alcohols. The evolved P450 BM-3 exhibits higher turnover rates than any reported biocatalyst for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons of small to medium chain length (C3-C8). Unlike naturally occurring alkane hydroxylases, the best known of which are the large complexes of methane monooxygenase (MMO) and membrane-associated non-heme iron alkane monooxygenase (AlkB), the evolved enzyme is monomeric, soluble, and requires no additional proteins for catalysis. The evolved alkane hydroxylase was found to be even more active on fatty acids than wild-type BM-3, which was already one of the most efficient fatty acid monooxgenases known. A broad range of substrates including the gaseous alkane propane induces the low to high spin shift that activates the enzyme.

12234835	10.1128/AAC.46.10.3133-3141.2002	Multidrug pump inhibitors uncover remarkable activity of plant antimicrobials.	Plant antimicrobials are not used as systemic antibiotics at present. The main reason for this is their low level of activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria. The reported MIC is often in the range of 100 to 1,000 micro g/ml, orders of magnitude higher than those of common broad-spectrum antibiotics from bacteria or fungi. Major plant pathogens belong to the gram-negative bacteria, which makes the low level of activity of plant antimicrobials against this group of microorganisms puzzling. Gram-negative bacteria have an effective permeability barrier, comprised of the outer membrane, which restricts the penetration of amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance pumps (MDRs), which extrude toxins across this barrier. It is possible that the apparent ineffectiveness of plant antimicrobials is largely due to the permeability barrier. We tested this hypothesis in the present study by applying a combination of MDR mutants and MDR inhibitors.

Hylesia metabus larvae are susceptible to several pathogens indigenous to the area in which they are found. Some larvae show symptoms characteristic of bacterial infection; they become flaccid and lethargic, and show a marked loss of appetite. We isolated and identified 29 bacterial strains from live, dead and experimentally infected H. metabus larvae, and evaluated their pathogenic activity. The bacteria which caused mortality in the larvae were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60-93.3%), Proteus vulgaris (20%), Alcaligenes faecalis, Planococcus sp. and Bacillus megaterium (10%), at doses of 3-4 x 10(7). Although P. aeruginosa is a well-known insect pathogen, this is the first report of its pathogenic activity on H. metabus. The potential risk to humans and low virulence make it unlikely that P. aeruginosa could be used in an augmentative biological control programme. However its natural incidence may be enhanced using parasites and predators of H. metabus as carriers.	2002	10	25	J Invertebr Pathol	Journal of invertebrate pathology	Animals; Bacteria; Larva; Moths	Osborn	Frances
12232665	10.1007/s00284-002-3681-1	Bioremediation of an industrial effluent containing monocrotophos.	Almost 30% of the precious agricultural output of India is lost owing to pest infestation. In India, pesticide consumption for protecting crops is about 3% of the total world consumption. Monocrotophos (MCP), an organophosphorus insecticide, is widely used to control insects on crops. Being readily water soluble and highly toxic, its removal from wastewater generated during manufacture becomes inevitable. Bioremediation of wastewater containing MCP by Arthrobacter atrocyaneus, Bacillus megaterium, and Pseudomonas mendocina was highest at pH 8.0, but maximum reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) was at pH 7.0. Removal of MCP and reduction in COD by B. megaterium and Ps. mendocina were highest at 35 degrees C, while with A. atrocyaneus, it was maximum at 30 degrees C, under aerated culture condition and inoculum density of 10(8) cells/ml. Use of pure cultures for bioremediation of effluent containing MCP appears to be the first such attempt.	2002	12	3	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Arthrobacter; Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; India; Insecticides; Monocrotophos; Pseudomonas; Water Pollutants, Chemical	Bhadbhade	Bharati J

12196147	10.1042/bst0300610	Production of cobalamin and sirohaem in Bacillus megaterium: an investigation into the role of the branchpoint chelatases sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase (SirB) and sirohydrochlorin cobalt chelatase (CbiX).	One of the four operons required for cobalamin biosynthesis in Bacillus megaterium is also associated with sirohaem synthesis, and contains three genes, sirA, sirB and sirC. By undertaking functional complementation experiments and in vitro assays using recombinantly produced enzymes, we have been able to demonstrate that (1) SirA acts as a uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase, transforming uroporphyrinogen III into precorrin-2, (2) SirC acts as an NAD(+) dehydrogenase, responsible for the oxidation of precorrin-2 into sirohydrochlorin, and (3) SirB acts as a ferrochelatase, responsible for the insertion of a ferrous ion into sirohydrochlorin to give sirohaem. Comparative sequence analysis reveals that the primary structure of SirB is highly similar to that of the cobalt chelatase involved in cobalamin biosynthesis in Bacillus megaterium, CbiX, with the exception that CbiX contains a C-terminal histidine-rich motif.

The availability of a suitable database is critical in a proteomic approach for bacterial identification by mass spectrometry (MS). The major limitation of the present public proteome database is the lack of extensive low-mass bacterial protein entries with masses experimentally verified for most bacteria. Here, we present a method based on mass spectrometry to create protein mass tables specifically tailored for bacterial identification. Several issues related to the detection of bacterial proteins for the purpose of database creation are addressed. Three species of bacteria, namely, Escherichia coli, Bacillus megaterium, and Citrobacter freundii, which can be found in the ambient environment, were chosen for this study.

12111148	10.1007/s00253-002-0986-8	Construction of self-disruptive Bacillus megaterium in response to substrate exhaustion for polyhydroxybutyrate production.	In order to establish a novel recovery system for polyhydroxyalkanoates, a self-disruptive strain of Bacillus megaterium that responds to substrate exhaustion was constructed. A gene cassette carrying the lysis system of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens phage - holin and endolysin - was inserted into the Escherichia coli- Bacillus subtilis shuttle vector pX under the control of a xylose-inducible expression system, xylR-xylA '. In this system, the expression of a target gene is induced by xylose but inhibited by glucose, which acts as an anti-inducer. B. megaterium was transformed with pX conveying the phage lysis system, which was integrated into the amyE locus of chromosomal DNA of B. megaterium by homologous recombination. The lysis system caused self-disruption of the transformant cells effectively even when expression of the lysis genes was induced during stationary phase.

In order to find reasons for the absence of fire blight in most countries of the Southern hemisphere, bark samples from apple and pear trees in orchards of the Western Cape region in South Africa were extracted for bacteria which could be antagonistic to Erwinia amylovora. Screening was done in the late growth season and mainly Gram-positive bacteria were isolated. Approximately half of them produced growth inhibition zones on a lawn of E. amylovora. Most isolates were classified as Bacillus megaterium by microbiological assays and in API 50 test systems. They were visualized in the light microscope as non-motile large rods. These strains may not be responsible for the absence of fire blight in orchards, but they may indicate unfavourable climatic conditions for Gram-negative bacteria including E. amylovora. They may reduce the ability of E. amylovora to establish fire blight and could also be useful for application in biological disease control.	2002	9	17	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Bacillus; Culture Media; Erwinia; Malus; Plant Diseases; Rosaceae; South Africa	Jock	Susanne

Bacteriolytic activity was detected in extracts of whole mite and spent growth medium (SGM) from the clinically important Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae mites and was most abundant in whole mite extract. Gram-positive organisms Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Bacillus megaterium and Listeria monocytogenes were preferentially lysed and the lytic activity was enhanced by thiols, destroyed by mite proteases, inhibited by HgCl2 and high concentrations of NaCl but was resistant to heat and acid treatment. Substrate SDS-PAGE analysis indicated the presence of several lytic enzymes, two of which were isolated from D. pteronyssinus spent growth medium extract by hydroxyapatite chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of one of them was then used in PCR-based cloning studies. The complete amino acid sequence of this protein was determined and cDNA found to encode a 130-amino acid residue mature protein with a 20-amino acid leader sequence.

Oviposition attractants could be used for monitoring as well as controlling mosquitoes by attracting them to lay eggs at chosen sites. In the present study, culture filtrates of seven bacterial species were tested for their attractancy against gravid females of Culex quinquefasciatus. When their oviposition active indices (OAI) were studied, the culture filtrates of Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas fluorescens exhibited oviposition attractancy (OAI = &gt; 0.3) at 100 ppm and the OAI were respectively 0.70 and 0.47. Culture filtrates of B. thuringiensis var. israelensis (wild type), B. t. var. israelensis (mutant) and B. sphaericus showed attractancy at 2000 ppm with OAI of respectively 0.71, 0.59 and 0.68. However, the OAI of B. megaterium as well as Azospirillum brasilense was 0.13 (at 2000 ppm), which was less than 0.3 required to be considered them as attractants.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to detect phytoplasmas in Canary Island date (Phoenix canariensis) palms displaying symptoms similar to lethal yellowing (LY) disease in Corpus Christi, TX. An rDNA product (1.8 kb) was amplified consistently from 10 of 11 palms by PCR employing phytoplasma universal rRNA primer pair P1/P7. Also, AluI endonu-clease digests and sequencing of P1/P7 products revealed that nontarget Bacillus megaterium-related rDNA sequences of similar size were co-amplified along with phytoplasma rDNA from 10 palms. A 1,402-bp product was obtained from all 11 symptomatic palms when initial P1/P7 products were reamplified by PCR employing nested LY phytoplasma group-specific 16S rRNA primer pair LY16Sf/LY16Sr. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of nested PCR products revealed that palm-infecting phytoplasmas were uniform and most similar to strains composing the coconut lethal yellowing phytoplasma (16SrIV) group.

This article reports studies concerning the production of penicillin G acylase (PGA) by Bacillus megaterium. This enzyme has industrial use in the hydrolysis of penicillin G to obtain 6-aminopenicillanic acid, an essential intermediate for the production of semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics. Although most microorganisms produce the enzyme intracellularly, B. megaterium provides extracellular PGA. The enzyme production by microorganisms involves several steps, resulting in a many operational variables to be studied. The study of the inoculum is an important step to be accomplished, before addressing other issues such as culture optimization and downstream processing. In this study, using a standard inoculum as reference, several runs were performed aiming at the definition of operational conditions in the PGA production. Cell concentration and PGA activity in the production medium were measured after 24, 48, and 72 h of the beginning of the production phase.

12020135	10.1006/bioo.2002.1239	Use of kinetic isotope effects to delineate the role of phenylalanine 87 in P450(BM-3).	The substrate oxidation rates of P450(BM-3) are unparalleled in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes. Furthermore, the bacterial enzyme, originating from Bacillus megaterium, has been used repeatedly as a model to study the metabolism of mammalian P450s. A specific example is presented where studying P450(BM-3) substrate dynamics can define important enzyme-substrate characteristics, which may be useful in modeling omega-hydroxylation seen in mammalian P450s. In addition, if the reactive species responsible for metabolism can be controlled to produce specific products this enzyme could be a useful biocatalyst. Based on crystal structures and the fact that the P450(BM-3) F87A mutant produces a large isotope in contrast to the native enzyme, we propose that phenylalanine 87 is responsible for hindering substrate access to the active oxygen species for nonnative substrates.

Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards.

Two strains (B728a and Y37) of the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae isolated from bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) plants were shown to produce in culture both syringomycin, a lipodepsinonapeptide secreted by the majority of the strains of the bacterium, and a new form of syringopeptin, SP(22)Phv. The structure of the latter metabolite was elucidated by the combined use of mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and chemical procedures. Comparative phytotoxic and antimicrobial assays showed that SP(22)Phv did not differ substantially from the previously characterized syringopeptin 22 (SP(22)) as far as toxicity to plants was concerned, but was less active in inhibiting the growth of the test fungi Rhodotorula pilimanae and Geotrichum candidum and of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium.	2002	8	27	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biochimica et biophysica acta	Amino Acid Sequence; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; Bacterial Toxins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fabaceae; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptides, Cyclic; Pseudomonas; Species Specificity; Tobacco	Grgurina	Ingeborg

It was found that the activity of 0.1 mM 4-NQO was reduced (P &lt; 0.01) after coincubation with Bacillus suspensions (10(8) CFU/ml for 150 min at 37 degrees C). All isolates showed potential for deactivating 4-NQO, and genotoxicity inhibition ranged from 92.9 to 100%. There were no appreciable differences in behaviour observed among probiotic and collection strains or in relation to species. The observed antigenotoxicity was associated with a clear-cut modification of 4-NQO molecular characteristics.	2002	11	4	Res Microbiol	Research in microbiology	4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide; Alkaline Phosphatase; Antimutagenic Agents; Bacillus; Probiotics; SOS Response, Genetics; beta-Galactosidase	Caldini	Giovanna

The effect of spore density on the germination (time-to-germination, percent germination) of Bacillus megaterium spores on tryptic soy agar was determined using direct microscopic observation. Inoculum size varied from approximately 10(3) to 10(8) cfu ml(-1) in a medium where pH=7 and the sodium chloride concentration was 0.5% w/v. Inoculum size was measured by global inoculum size (the concentration of spores on a microscope slide) and local inoculum size (the number of spores observed in a given microscope field of observation). Both global and local inoculum sizes had a significant effect on time-to-germination (TTG), but only the global inoculum size influenced the percentage germination of the observed spores. These results show that higher concentrations of Bacillus megaterium spores encourage more rapid germination and more spores to germinate, indicating that low spore populations do not behave similarly to high spore populations.

We report spots of excited molecules of 33 nm width created with focused light of lambda = 760 nm wavelength and conventional optics along the optic axis. This is accomplished by exciting the molecules with a femtosecond pulse and subsequent depletion of their excited state with red-shifted, picosecond-pulsed, counterpropagating, coherent light fields. The lambda/23 ratio constitutes what is to our knowledge the sharpest spatial definition attained with freely propagating electromagnetic radiation.

Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with Mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan.

The specificity of Bacillus stearothermophilus TRS40 neopullulanase toward amylose and amylopectin was analyzed. Although this neopullulanase completely hydrolyzed amylose to produce maltose as the main product, it scarcely hydrolyzed amylopectin. The molecular mass of amylopectin was decreased by only one order of magnitude, from approximately 10(8) to 10(7) Da. Furthermore, this neopullulanase selectively hydrolyzed amylose when starch was used as a substrate. This phenomenon, efficient hydrolysis of amylose but not amylopectin, was also observed with cyclomaltodextrinase from alkaliphilic Bacillus sp. strain A2-5a and maltogenic amylase from Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 27811. These three enzymes hydrolyzed cyclomaltodextrins and amylose much faster than pullulan.

11847292	10.1110/ps.27302	Breaking the singleton of germination protease.	Germination protease (GPR) plays an important role in the germination of spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species. A few very similar GPRs form a singleton group without significant sequence similarities to any other proteins. Their active site locations and catalytic mechanisms are unclear, despite the recent 3-D structure determination of Bacillus megaterium GPR. Using structural comparison and sequence analysis, we show that GPR is homologous to bacterial hydrogenase maturation protease (HybD). HybD's activity relies on the recognition and binding of metal ions in Ni-Fe hydrogenase, its substrate. Two highly conserved motifs are shared among GPRs, hydrogenase maturation proteases, and another group of hypothetical proteins. Conservation of two acidic residues in all these homologs indicates that metal binding is important for their function.

A clone from a Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 Lambda ZAP II genomic library was isolated by its ability to complement the anaerobic growth deficiency of an Escherichia coli (pfl, ldh) double mutant. The 1.0-kb insert from the clone was sequenced and revealed a single open reading frame (ORF, 957-bp) which was preceded by a putative Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence (AGGGGG). The potential SD sequence corresponded to 3' 16S rRNA sequences of various Selenomonas strains. The ORF was predicted to encode a protein of 318 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 34,975 Da and an isoelectric point of 5.54. In addition, the ORF contained 51 mol % G + C and this is consistent with the average G + C content (54%) of the S. ruminantium chromosome.

Complementation of the mbgA mutant with a multicopy plasmid carrying intact mbga restored the ability to utilize lactose for cell growth. Crude extracts from the wild-type B. megaterium cells grown in the presence of lactose exhibited a significant level of lactose-hydrolyzing activity, whereas no activity was observed in crude extracts of the mbgA mutant grown under the same condition. The mbgA gene could also confer the ability of lactose utilization on a lacZ deletion mutant of Escherichia coli.

This paper reports on the application of the molecular Lego approach to P450 enzymes. Protein domains are used as catalytic (P450 BM3 haem domain and human P450 2E1) or electron transfer (flavodoxin and P450 BM3 reductase) modules. The objectives are to build assemblies with improved electrochemical properties, to construct soluble human P450 enzymes, and to generate libraries of new P450 catalytic modules based on P450 BM3. A rationally designed, gene-fused assembly (BMP-FLD) was obtained from the soluble haem domain of cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium (BMP) and flavodoxin from Desulfovibrio vulgaris (FLD). The assembly was expressed successfully and characterised in its active form, displaying improved electrochemical properties. Solubilisation of the human, membrane-bound P450 2E1 (2E1) was achieved by fusing key elements of the 2E1 enzyme with selected parts of P450 BM3.

A gram-positive bacterium (designated strain INT005) that accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) was isolated from gas field soil. From its morphological and physiological properties and the partial nucleotide sequence (about 500 bp) of its 16S rDNA, it was suggested that strain INT005 was similar to several species of the genus Bacillus. We confirmed that strain INT005 is a Bacillus sp. The PHA productivities of strain INT005 were higher than those of Bacillus megaterium and Ralstonia eutropha at 37-45 degrees C reported to date, and it was suggested that the PHA synthase of INT005 may exhibit moderate thermostability. The bacterium had the ability to produce poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-6-hydroxyhexanoate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) from the appropriate carbon sources.

To find the accessory proteins participating in expression and maturation of nickel-containing superoxide dismutase (NiSOD), a metal-binding protein (CbiXhp) homologous to cobaltochelatase (CbiX) of Bacillus megaterium was isolated by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin from Streptomyces seoulensis. The deduced amino acid sequence of cbiXhp showed 87% and 39% identity to CbiX of Streptomyces coelicolor and that of B. megaterium, respectively. Overexpression of CbiXhp increased the activity and the expression of NiSOD in the presence and absence of nickel, but to a lesser extent in its absence.

Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 plasmid pBM400, one of seven indigenous plasmids, has been labeled with a selectable marker, isolated, completely sequenced, and partially characterized. A sequence of 53,903 bp was generated, revealing a total of 50 predicted open reading frames (ORFs); 33 were carried on one strand and 17 were carried on the other. These ORFs comprised 57% of the pBM400 sequence. Besides the replicon region and a complete rRNA operon that have previously been described, several interesting genes were found, including genes for predicted proteins for cell division (FtsZ and FtsK), DNA-RNA interaction (FtsK, Int/Rec, and reverse transcriptase), germination (CwlJ), styrene degradation (StyA), and heavy metal resistance (Cu-Cd export and ATPase). Three of the ORF products had high similarities to proteins from the Bacillus anthracis virulence plasmid pXO1.

14593507	10.1007/s00253-003-1469-2	Identification and functional characterization of a type I signal peptidase gene of Bacillus megaterium DSM319.	The sipM gene of Bacillus megaterium encoding a type I signal peptidase (SPase) was isolated and structurally characterized. RNA analysis revealed a transcript size in accordance with a bicistronic operon comprising sipM and an adjacent open reading frame. Inactivation of sipM by targeted gene disruption could not be achieved, indicating its essential role for cell viability since there might be no other type I SPase of major importance present in B. megaterium. Plasmid-assisted amplification of the gene resulted in an increase in activity of the heterologous glucanase used as an extracellular reporter, suggesting a potential bottleneck for protein secretion within this species.	2004	7	27	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Cellulase; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Deletion; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression; Gene Order; Genes, Bacterial; Genes, Essential; Genes, Reporter; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Operon; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Serine Endopeptidases; Transcription, Genetic	Nahrstedt	H
14583039	10.1021/ja0303790	Regio- and enantioselective alkane hydroxylation with engineered cytochromes P450 BM-3.	Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium was engineered using a combination of directed evolution and site-directed mutagenesis to hydroxylate linear alkanes regio- and enantioselectively using atmospheric dioxygen as an oxidant. BM-3 variant 9-10A-A328V hydroxylates octane at the 2-position to form S-2-octanol (40% ee). Another variant, 1-12G, also hydroxylates alkanes larger than hexane primarily at the 2-position but forms R-2-alcohols (40-55% ee). These biocatalysts are highly active (rates up to 400 min(-1)) and support thousands of product turnovers. The regio- and enantioselectivities are retained in whole-cell biotransformations with Escherichia coli, where the engineered P450s can be expressed at high levels and the cofactor is supplied endogenously.	2004	2	26	J Am Chem Soc	Journal of the American Chemical Society	Alcohols; Alkanes; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Escherichia coli; Hydroxylation; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Engineering; Stereoisomerism; Substrate Specificity	Peters	Matthew W

A gene coding for endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase (lichenase) containing a recombinant plasmid, pLL200K, was transferred from Bacillus circulans into a new shuttle plasmid, pLLS920, by ligating linearized DNAs of pLL200K and pUB110. B. subtilis RM125 and B. megaterium ATCC14945 transformed with pLLS920 produced the endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase. The enzyme was produced during active growth with maximum activity. The B. subtilis (pLLS920) enzyme was 83 times (8522 mU ml(-1)) more active than that of the gene donor cells (103 mU ml(-1)). The B. megaterium (pLLS920) enzyme was 7 times (735 mU ml(-1)) more active than that of the gene donor cells. While E. coli secreted only about 10% of the produced enzyme, B. subtilis excreted the enzyme completely into the medium and B. megaterium by about 98%. The plasmid pLLS920 was stable in B. megaterium (98%), and in B. subtilis (51%) but not in E. coli (29%).	2004	5	11	Biotechnol Lett	Biotechnology letters	Bacillus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Endo-1,3(4)-beta-Glucanase; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Stability; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Protein Engineering; Species Specificity	Kim	Ji-Yeon

The production of lysine by Bacillus megaterium SP-14 and Bacillus circulans Tx-22 using agricultural by-products as carbon and nitrogen sources was assessed. Among the carbon substrates used were potato, sorghum, plantain, millet, yam, cassava, and corn starches, while the nitrogen sources include cowpea, bambara-nut, cotton seed, groundnut, soybean, and blood meals. The effect of natural nitrogen sources (1.0% w/v) and synthetic nitrogen source (4.0% w/v (NH4)2SO4) on lysine production by the Bacillus strains showed that natural nitrogen sources gave better lysine yields.	2003	12	23	Nahrung	Die Nahrung	Agriculture; Bacillus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Cells, Cultured; Fermentation; Food Microbiology; Lysine; Nitrogen	Ekwealor	Ikechukwu A

The aim of this study was to perform the isolation, cloning and characterization of a lipase from Bacillus sp. BP-6 bearing the features of a biotechnologically important group of enzymes. Strain Bacillus sp. BP-6, showing activity on tributyrin plates, was used for isolation of lipase-coding gene lipA by means of inverse and direct PCR. The complete 633 nucleotide ORF isolated was cloned in Escherichia coli for further characterization. The amino acid sequence of the cloned protein was 98% identical to B. subtilis and B. megaterium lipases, the enzyme also showing similar molecular and biochemical features. The gene coding for Bacillus sp. BP-6 LipA was found in all mesophilic Bacillus species assayed, indicating its ubiquity in the genus. The cloned enzyme displayed the same properties as those of homologous lipases. The overall profile of Bacillus sp.

Sodium caseinates prepared from bovine, sheep, goat, pig, buffalo or human milk were hydrolyzed by a partially purified proteinase of Lactobacillus helveticus PR4. Peptides in each hydrolysate were fractionated by reversed-phase fast-protein liquid chromatography. The fractions which showed the highest angiotensin I-converting-enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory or antibacterial activity were sequenced by mass spectrum and Edman degradation analyses. Various ACE-inhibitory peptides were found in the hydrolysates: the bovine alpha(S1)-casein (alpha(S1)-CN) 24-47 fragment (f24-47), f169-193, and beta-CN f58-76; ovine alpha(S1)-CN f1-6 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-185 and f186-188; caprine beta-CN f58-65 and alpha(S2)-CN f182-187; buffalo beta-CN f58-66; and a mixture of three tripeptides originating from human beta-CN.

12917443	10.1074/jbc.M306112200	Characterization of the cobaltochelatase CbiXL: evidence for a 4Fe-4S center housed within an MXCXXC motif.	CbiX is a cobaltochelatase required for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12 and is found in Archaea as a short form (CbiXS containing 120-145 amino acids) and in some bacteria as a longer version (CbiXL containing 300-350 amino acids). Purification of either recombinant Bacillus megaterium or Synechocystis CbiXL in Escherichia coli, which is facilitated by the presence of a naturally occurring histidine-rich region of the protein, results in the isolation of a dark brown protein solution. The UV/visible spectrum of the protein is consistent with the presence of a redox group, and the lack of definition within the spectrum is suggestive of a 4Fe-4S center. The presence of an iron-sulfur center was confirmed by EPR analysis of the proteins, which produces a pseudoaxial spectrum with g values at 2.04, 1.94, and 1.90. The EPR spectrum was absent at 70 K, an observation that is diagnostic of a 4Fe-4S center.

12900036	10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00509-3	Chloride dependence of growth in bacteria.	Chloride is an abundant anion on earth but studies analyzing a possible function of chloride in prokaryotes are scarce. To address the question, we have tested 44 different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for a chloride dependence or chloride stimulation of growth. None required chloride for growth at their optimal growth (salt) conditions. However, in hyperosmotic media containing high concentrations of Na+, 11 bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, Paracoccus denitrificans, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Thermus thermophilus, and Vibrio fischeri) had a strict chloride dependence for growth or were significantly stimulated by chloride. These data show that chloride is essential for growth at high salt (Na+) concentrations in various species of the domain Bacteria.	2004	1	5	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Chlorides; Culture Media; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Osmolar Concentration; Sodium	Roessler	Markus
12893263	10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01234-8	Expression of recombinant Clostridium difficile toxin A using the Bacillus megaterium system.	Pathogenic Clostridium difficile produces two major protein toxins, toxin A and toxin B. We used the Bacillus megaterium expression system for expression of recombinant toxin A. The construct for the toxin A gene was obtained by the following cloning strategy: the gene for toxin A was generated in three parts, each of them ligated into a cloning vector. The three parts were sequentially fused to the complete gene. The holotoxin gene was ligated into the expression vector pWH1520. This vector was modified to generate a toxin with a C-terminally located His-tag. Gene expression in the B. megaterium system resulted in an approximate 300 kDa protein, which was identified by specific antibody as toxin A. Recombinant, His-tagged toxin A was purified by Ni(2+) as well as thyroglobulin affinity chromatography. Characterization of the recombinant toxin A showed identical cytotoxicity and in vitro-glucosyltransferase activity as the native toxin A from C. difficile.	2003	9	4	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Toxins; Cell Line; Enterotoxins; Gene Expression; Genetic Vectors; Recombinant Proteins	Burger	Silke

Advantage is taken in many sterilization processes, especially for food packaging materials, of the synergy between H2O2 and UV irradiation for spore killing. The nature of the synergy is currently not well defined in terms of targets and mechanisms. We found that under some experimental conditions, the synergistic killing of spores of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213 appeared to be mainly UV-enhanced peroxide killing, while under other conditions, it appeared to be mainly peroxide-enhanced UV killing. Lethal combinations of H2O2 and UV irradiation for spores resulted in only modest increases in auxotrophic mutations among survivors, indicative of little DNA damage, in contrast to higher mutation levels after dry-heat damage at 115 degrees C. However, the combination of UV light and peroxide did lead to major inactivation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that was used to monitor the damage to bacterial protein.

Comparative sequence analysis was performed upon Bacillus anthracis and its closest relatives, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. Portions of rpoB DNA from 10 strains of B. anthracis, 16 of B. cereus, 10 of B. thuringiensis, 1 of B. mycoides, and 1 of B. megaterium were amplified and sequenced. The determined rpoB sequences (318 bp) of the 10 B. anthracis strains, including five Korean isolates, were identical to those of Ames, Florida, Kruger B, and Western NA strains. Strains of the "B. cereus group" were separated into two subgroups, in which the B. anthracis strains formed a separate clade in the phylogenetic tree. However, B. cereus and B. thuringiensis could not be differentiated. Sequence analysis confirmed the five Korean isolates as B. anthracis. Based on the rpoB sequences determined in the present study, multiplex PCR generating either B. anthracis-specific amplicons (359 and 208 bp) or cap DNA (291 bp) in a virulence plasmid could be used for the rapid differential detection a	2003	10	2	J Clin Microbiol	Journal of clinical microbiology	Anthrax; Bacillus anthracis; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Sequence; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Humans; Korea; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Ko	Kwan Soo

Molecular analysis of a genomic region of Bacillus megaterium, a polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-producing microorganism, revealed the presence of a gene coding for the enzyme phosphotransbutyrylase (Ptb). Enzyme activity was measured throughout the different growth phases of B. megaterium and was found to correlate with PHB accumulation during the late-exponential growth phase. Ptb expression was repressed by glucose and activated by the branched amino acids isoleucine and valine. Overexpression of Act(Bm), a sigma(54) regulator from B. megaterium whose gene is located upstream from ptb, caused an increase in Ptb activity and PHB accumulation in B. megaterium.	2003	11	21	Int Microbiol	International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology	Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Carbohydrates; DNA-Binding Proteins; DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; Genes, Bacterial; Hydroxybutyrates; Kinetics; Phosphate Acetyltransferase; Polyesters; RNA Polymerase Sigma 54; Sigma Factor	Vazquez	Gustavo J

In a project concerning bacterial colonization of experimental wall paintings, a large number of isolates have been acquired with high similarities in their whole-cell protein patterns obtained after SDS-PAGE. Of this group, four strains, designated V2-BIII-A2(T), V2-BI-A9, V2-BI-04 and V2-BII-A8, were chosen for further characterization. Banding patterns obtained after ERIC-PCR were barely distinguishable among these four strains, indicating their affiliation within a single species. The isolates also displayed nearly identical biochemical and physiological features. The chemotaxonomic characteristics, including polar lipids, quinone systems, cell-wall diamino acid composition and fatty acid profiles, were in good agreement with those of numerous previously described Bacillus species. 16S rDNA analysis of strain V2-BIII-A2(T) showed that this bacterium belongs to the genus Bacillus, with highest sequence similarities to Bacillus megaterium (94.6%), Bacillus flexus (94.4%) and the alka	2003	8	21	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Austria; Bacillus; Bacterial Typing Techniques; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Ribosomal; Molecular Sequence Data; Paintings; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA	T..ubel	Martin

Mercury resistance phenotypes were classified into broad-spectrum (resistant to inorganic Hg(2+) and organomercurials) and narrow-spectrum (resistant to inorganic Hg(2+) and sensitive to organomercurials) groups. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product sizes and the restriction nuclease site maps of mer operon regions from all broad-spectrum Hg R Bacillus were identical to that of Bacillus megaterium MB1. On the other hand, the PCR products of the targeted merP (extracellular mercury-binding protein gene) and merA (intracellular mercury reductase protein gene) regions from the narrow-spectrum Hg R Bacillus were generally smaller than those of the B. megaterium MB1 mer determinant.

19265991		Tylenchulus semipenetrans Alters the Microbial Community in the Citrus Rhizosphere.	Infection of citrus seedlings by Tylenchulus semipenetrans was shown to reduce subsequent infection of roots by Phytophthora nicotianae and to increase plant growth compared to plants infected by only the fungus. Hypothetical mechanisms by which the nematode suppresses fungal development include nutrient competition, direct antibiosis, or alteration of the microbial community in the rhizosphere to favor microorganisms antagonistic to P. nicotianae. A test of the last hypothesis was conducted via surveys of five sites in each of three citrus orchards infested with both organisms. A total of 180 2-cm-long fibrous root segments, half with a female T. semipenetrans egg mass on the root surface and half without, were obtained from each orchard site.

An NaCl-independent stability-enhanced mutant of glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) was obtained by using in vitro directed evolution. The family shuffling method was applied for in vitro directed evolution to construct a mutant library of GlcDH genes. Three GlcDH-coding genes from Bacillus licheniformis IFO 12200, Bacillus megaterium IFO 15308 and Bacillus subtilis IFO 13719 were each cloned by direct PCR amplification into the p Trc99A expression vector and expressed in the host, Escherichia coli. In addition to these three GlcDH genes, a gene encoding a previously obtained GlcDH mutant, F20 (Q252L), derived from B. megaterium IWG3, was also subjected to directed evolution by the family shuffling method. A highly thermostable mutant, GlcDH DN-46, was isolated in the presence or absence of NaCl after the second round of family shuffling and filter-based screening of the mutant libraries.

The cobaltochelatase required for the synthesis of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) in the archaeal kingdom has been identified as CbiX through similarity searching with the CbiX from Bacillus megaterium. However, the CbiX proteins in the archaea are much shorter than the CbiX proteins found in eubacteria, typically containing less than half the number of amino acids in their primary structure. For this reason the shorter CbiX proteins have been termed CbiXS and the longer versions CbiXL. The CbiXS proteins from Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanobacter thermoautotrophicum were overproduced in Escherichia coli as recombinant proteins and characterized. Through complementation studies of a defined chelatase-deficient strain of E. coli and by direct in vitro assays the function of CbiXS as a sirohydrochlorin cobaltochelatase has been demonstrated. On the basis of sequence alignments and conserved active site residues we suggest that CbiXS may represent a primordial chelatase, giving rise to larger	2003	8	21	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Amino Acid Sequence; Archaea; Bacterial Proteins; Circular Dichroism; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Lyases; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Protein Conformation; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet	Brindley	Amanda A

An experimental slow sand filter (SSF) was constructed to study the spatial and temporal structure of a bacterial community suppressive to an oomycete plant pathogen, Phytophthora cryptogea. Passage of water through the mature sand column resulted in complete removal of zoospores of the plant pathogen. To monitor global changes in the microbial community, bacterial and fungal numbers were estimated on selective media, direct viable counts of fungal spores were made, and the ATP content was measured. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were used to study the dynamics of the bacterial community in detail. The top layer (1 cm) of the SSF column was dominated by a variable and active microbial population, whereas the middle (50 cm) and bottom (80 cm) layers were dominated by less active and diverse bacterial populations. The major changes in the microbial populations occurred during the first week of filter operation, and these populations	2003	6	24	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacteria; Crops, Agricultural; DNA, Ribosomal; Ecosystem; Electrophoresis; Filtration; Genes, rRNA; Molecular Sequence Data; Phytophthora; Plant Diseases; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Silicon Dioxide; Spores, Fungal; Water Microbiology; Water Purification	Calvo-Bado	Leo A
12675611	10.1021/bp020293v	Improved catalytic performance of Bacillus megaterium epoxide hydrolase in a medium containing Tween-80.	A new epoxide hydrolase with high enantioselectivity toward (R)-glycidyl phenyl ether (R-GPE) was partially purified from Bacillus megaterium strain ECU1001. The maximum activity of the isolated enzyme was observed at 30 degrees C and pH 6.5 in a buffer system with 5% (v/v) of DMSO as a cosolvent. The enzyme was quite stable at pH 7.5 and retained full activity after incubation at 40 degrees C for 6 h. Interestingly, when the cosolvent DMSO was replaced by an emulsifier (Tween-80, 0.5% w/v) as an alternative additive to help disperse the water-insoluble substrate, the apparent activity of the epoxide hydrolase significantly increased by about 1.8-fold, while the temperature optimum shifted from 30 to 40 degrees C and the half-life of the enzyme at 50 degrees C increased by 2.5 times.

12632212	10.1007/s00248-002-2034-8	Predominant Bacillus spp. in agricultural soil under different management regimes detected via PCR-DGGE.	A PCR system for studying the diversity of species of Bacillus and related taxa directly from soil was developed. For this purpose, a specific 24-bp forward primer located around position 110 of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was designed and combined with a reverse bacterial primer located at the end of the gene. The specificity of this PCR system for bacilli and related taxons was confirmed on the basis of tests with diverse strains as well as with soil DNA. Analysis of a soil DNA derived clone library showed that the amplified fragments affiliated exclusively with sequences of gram-positive bacteria, with up to 95% of the sequences originating from putative Bacillus species. In particular, sequences affiliated to those of B. mycoides, B. pumilus, B. megaterium, B. thuringiensis, and B. firmus, as well as to related taxa such as Paenibacillus, were obtained. A minority, i.e., less than 6%, of the clones affiliated with other gram-positive bacteria, such as Arthrobacter spp., Frankia spp.	2003	8	21	Microb Ecol	Microbial ecology	Bacillus; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis; Genetic Variation; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Soil Microbiology	Garbeva	P

Prostasomes are organelles secreted by human prostate epithelial cells and appear freely in semen. Most prostasomal functional and biochemical characteristics have been settled on basis of seminal prostasomes (SP). Three types of prostasomes, viz., from seminal plasma, prostate gland (native), and prostate cancer bone metastasis, were isolated and compared for their biochemical and functional characteristics. Flow cytometry showed that all three types of prostasomes had a similar size distribution and electrophoresis revealed close similarities in banding pattern. Also, a high cholesterol/phospholipid ratio and some marker enzymes were distinctive common features. The unusual chromogranin B (CgB)/chromogranin A (CgA) ratio with CgB in abundance over CgA, previously found only in SP, was also valid for the native (NP) and metastasis-derived prostasomes (MP). The latter prostasome type contained a 10-fold higher amount of CgA compared to the others.

Antimicrobial peptides/proteins are widespread in nature and play a critical role in host defense. To investigate whether these components contribute to surface protection of newborns at birth, we have characterized antimicrobial polypeptides in vernix caseosa (vernix) and amniotic fluid (AF). Concentrated peptide/protein extracts were obtained from 11 samples of vernix and six samples of AF and analyzed for antimicrobial activity using an inhibition zone assay. Proteins/peptides in all vernix extracts exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Bacillus megaterium (strain Bm11), in addition to antifungal activity against Candida albicans, whereas AF-derived proteins/peptides showed only the former activity. Fractions obtained after separation by reverse-phase HPLC exhibited antibacterial activity, with the most pronounced activity in a fraction containing alpha-defensins (HNP1-3). The presence of HNP1-3 was proved by dot blot analysis and confirmed by mass spectrometry.

12480527	10.1016/s0006-291x(02)02767-5	Differential expression of CYP102 in Bacillus megaterium by 17-beta-estradiol and 4-sec-butylphenol.	Previously we have reported the induction of CYP102 in Bacillus megaterium by 17beta-estradiol (E2) and 4-sec-butylphenol (4-sBP). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses demonstrated that E2 and 4-sBP both cause a dose-dependent disassociation of the Bm3R1 repressor protein from its binding site on the operator sequence of the CYP102 gene. Equimolar combinations of E2 and 4-sBP demonstrated additive induction of CYP102 compared to equivalent samples of E2 and 4-sBP added alone. Two gene constructs were used in this investigation. One construct designated BMC143 contained the entire regulatory region of CYP102. The other gene construct, designated BMA45, had the "Barbie box" sequence deleted. While the induction of CYP102 by 4-sBP was much higher in the BMC 143 construct, E2 induced CYP102 in both constructs to the same extent. This difference in induction of CYP102 by these two inducers indicates that they act at different sites, either on the Bm3R1 repressor protein or on posit	2003	2	13	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Enzyme Induction; Estradiol; Gene Expression; Genes, Bacterial; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Phenols	Rowley	Christopher W

In Bacillus megaterium, the hemAXBCDL genes were isolated and were found to be highly similar to the genes from Bacillus subtilis that are required for the conversion of glutamyl-tRNA into uroporphyrinogen III. Overproduction and purification of HemC (porphobilinogen deaminase) and -D (uroporphyrinogen III synthase) allowed these enzymes to be used for the in vitro synthesis of uroporphyrinogen III from porphobilinogen. A second smaller cluster of three genes (termed sirABC) was also isolated and found to encode the enzymes that catalyse the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into sirohaem on the basis of their ability to complement a defined Escherichia coli (cysG) mutant. The functions of SirC and -B were investigated by direct enzyme assay, where SirC was found to act as a precorrin-2 dehydrogenase, generating sirohydrochlorin, and SirB was found to act as a ferrochelatase responsible for the final step in sirohaem synthesis.

ABSTRACT A 3-year experiment was conducted in field microplots infested with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris race 5 at C..rdoba, Spain, in order to assess efficacy of an integrated management strategy for Fusarium wilt of chickpea that combined the choice of sowing date, use of partially resistant chickpea genotypes, and seed and soil treatments with biocontrol agents Bacillus megaterium RGAF 51, B. subtilis GB03, nonpathogenic F. oxysporum Fo 90105, and Pseudomonas fluorescens RG 26. Advancing the sowing date from early spring to winter significantly delayed disease onset, reduced the final disease intensity (amount of disease in a microplot that combines disease incidence and severity, expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible amount of disease in that microplot), and increased chickpea seed yield. A significant linear relationship was found between disease development over time and weather variables at the experimental site, with epidemics developing earlier and faster as 	2012	10	2	Phytopathology	Phytopathology	NA	Landa	Blanca B
16233581	10.1016/S1389-1723(04)70157-7	Recent biotechnological interventions for developing improved penicillin G acylases.	Penicillin G acylase (PAC; EC 3.5.1.11) is the key enzyme used in the industrial production of beta-lactam antibiotics. This enzyme hydrolyzes the side chain of penicillin G and related beta-lactam antibiotics releasing 6-amino penicillanic acid (6-APA), which is the building block in the manufacture of semisynthetic penicillins. PAC from Escherichia coli strain ATCC 11105, Bacillus megaterium strain ATCC 14945 and mutants of these two strains is currently used in industry. Genes encoding for PAC from various bacterial sources have been cloned and overexpressed with significant improvements in transcription, translation and post-translational processing. Recent developments in enzyme engineering have shown that PAC can be modified to gain conformational stability and desired functionality. This review provides an overview of recent advances in the production, stabilization and application of PAC, highlighting the recent biotechnological approaches for the improved catalysis of PAC.	2005	10	27	J Biosci Bioeng	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering	NA	Rajendhran	Jeyaprakash
15965890		DNA base composition, susceptibility to bacteriophages and interspecific transformation as criteria for classification in the genus Bacillus.	With 25 strains belonging to 12 species of the genus Bacillus, the base composition of DNA, the susceptibility to bacteriophages, and the ability to transform Bacillus subtilis strain Marburg were studied. Analyses of phage DNAs were also performed. The results were as follows: (1) The DNA base compositions were not uniform even among strains belonging to one taxonomic species. (2) The DNAs extracted from B. natto, B. megaterium and B. polymyxa could transform genetic traits of B. subtilis Marburg although the frequencies were not equal. (3) The host ranges of some temperate bacteriophages were correlated with the taxonomical data. On these bases, the phylogenetic relatedness of B. subtilis to B. megaterium was discussed.	2005	7	28	J Gen Appl Microbiol	The Journal of general and applied microbiology	Bacillus; Bacillus Phages; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Bacteriophage Typing; Base Composition; DNA, Bacterial; Transformation, Genetic	Ikeda	Yonosuke

Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 contains seven plasmids. Two are small rolling circle plasmids and five are theta-replicating plasmids with cross-hybridizing replicons that define a new family of very homologous yet compatible theta replicons. Previous sequencing of several of the plasmids has shown genes with high similarity to those on the genomes and plasmids of other Gram-positive bacteria. To test the possible distribution of these plasmids, nine other B. megaterium strains and 20 other Bacillus or related species were tested for the presence of similar replicons, and specific flanking DNA by both hybridization and PCR. The theta replicons were widespread among the B. megaterium strains, and two had one or more of the rolling circle plasmids, but none of the plasmid replicon regions were observed in the other Bacillus or related species. It appears from the data that even though some plasmids carry genes suggesting horizontal transfer, their replicons seem to be unique to B. megateri	2005	8	16	Plasmid	Plasmid	Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; DNA Replication; DNA, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Recombination, Genetic; Replicon; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Species Specificity	Rosso	Marie-Laure

The metabolism of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins by cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium and a mutant enzyme of it (AL4V; Ala74Gly, Phe87Val, Leu188Gln triple mutant) was examined. Both purified enzymes metabolized 1-monochloro-, 2,3-dichloro-, and 2,3,7-trichloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin, but not 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-p-dioxin. The mutant AL4V had 2-12 times higher activity than the wild-type P450 BM-3 towards polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. The products were hydroxylated at an unsubstituted position and/or showing migration of the chloride and were less toxic derivatives with lower than 10% toxicity of the original compounds.	2005	7	13	Biotechnol Lett	Biotechnology letters	Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Mutation; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Protein Engineering; Soil Pollutants; Species Specificity	Sulistyaningdyah	Woro Triarsi

The soil bacterial community and some inoculated bacteria were monitored to assess the microbial responses to prescribed fire in their microcosm. An acridine orange direct count of the bacteria in the unburned control soil were maintained at a relatively stable level (2.0 approximately 2.7 x 10(9) cells/g(-1).soil) during the 180 day study period. The number of bacteria in the surface soil was decreased by fire, but was restored after 3 months. Inoculation of some bacteria increased the number of inoculated bacteria several times and these elevated levels lasted several months. The ratios of eubacteria detected by a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method to direct bacterial count were in the range of 60 approximately 80% during the study period, with the exception of some lower values at the beginning, but there were no definite differences between the burned and unburned soils or the inoculated and uninoculated soils.

15644891	10.1139/w04-067	Co-induction of methyltransferase Rv0560c by naphthoquinones and fibric acids suggests attenuation of isoprenoid quinone action in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	The superoxide generator menadione was previously demonstrated as an inducer of growth stage dependent protein patterns in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The present study refines this observation by characterizing a novel 27-kDa protein that had not been observed in previous studies relying on younger cultures. A very similar response, based on two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analyses, was induced by the closely related naphthoquinone plumbagin. The 27-kDa protein was also induced by the pro-oxidant peroxisome proliferator gemfibrozil and to a lesser extent by the structurally related compounds fenofibrate and clofibrate. N-terminal sequence data of proteolytic fragments from the 27-kDa protein demonstrated its identity with protein Rv0560c, previously demonstrated to be inducible by salicylate, which also possesses peroxisome proliferating properties. Protein Rv0560c bears three conserved motifs characteristic of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases.

15623229		Molecular and functional characteristics, growth promoting effect and persistence of selected parent isolates and streptomycin resistant derivatives of rice rhizobacteria.	Molecular and functional characteristics of seven azospirilla and five phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) isolates of rice rhizosphere, growth promotion ability of two efficient strains, Azospirillum amazonense A10 (MTCC4716) and Bacillus megaterium P5 (MTCC4714) and their persistence based on streptomycin resistant derivatives (SRD), were determined. SDS-PAGE and isozyme banding patterns of the isolates were used to arbitrarily group the azospirilla into 4 and PSB into 3 clusters and as markers to ascertain their identity. The azospirilla produced 2.0 to 10.5 ppm of IAA like substances and showed nitrogenase activity of 0.02 to 3.55 nmole C2H4/hr/ml of pure culture. PSB isolates produced 7.8 to 15.0 ppm IAA like substances and 20 to 128 ppm soluble P. Induction of resistance to streptomycin resulted in changes of these properties.

A significant antibacterial activity, as determined with the agar diffusion method, was shown by C. sativum essential oil whereas a much reduced effect was observed for F. vulgare var. vulgare oil. C. sativum and F. vulgare var. vulgare essential oils may be useful natural bactericides for the control of bacterial diseases of plants and for seed treatment, in particular, in organic agriculture.

15610036	10.1021/bi049163g	Interaction of nitric oxide with cytochrome P450 BM3.	The interaction of nitric oxide with cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium has been analyzed by spectroscopic techniques and enzyme assays. Nitric oxide ligates tightly to the ferric heme iron, inducing large changes in each of the main visible bands of the heme and inhibiting the fatty acid hydroxylase function of the protein. However, the ferrous adduct is unstable under aerobic conditions, and activity recovers rapidly after addition of NADPH to the flavocytochrome due to reduction of the heme via the reductase domain and displacement of the ligand. The visible spectral properties revert to that of the oxidized resting form. Aerobic reduction of the nitrosyl complex of the BM3 holoenzyme or heme domain by sodium dithionite also displaces the ligand. A single electron reduction destabilizes the ferric-nitrosyl complex such that nitric oxide is released directly, as shown by the trapping of released nitric oxide.

15549292	10.1007/s00253-004-1761-9	Hydroxylation activity of P450 BM-3 mutant F87V towards aromatic compounds and its application to the synthesis of hydroquinone derivatives from phenolic compounds.	Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium is a fatty acid hydroxylase exhibiting selectivity for long-chain substrates (12-20 carbons). Replacement of Phe87 in P450 BM-3 by Val (F87V) greatly increased its activity towards a variety of aromatic and phenolic compounds. The apparent initial reaction rates of F87V as to benzothiophene, indan, 2,6-dichlorophenol, and 2-(benzyloxy)phenol were 227, 204, 129, and 385 nmol min(-1) nmol(-1) P450, which are 220-, 66-, 99-, and 963-fold those of the wild type, respectively. These results indicate that Phe87 plays a critical role in the control of the substrate specificity of P450 BM-3. Furthermore, F87V catalyzed regioselective hydroxylation at the para position of various phenolic compounds. In particular, F87V showed high activity as to the hydroxylation of 2-(benzyloxy)phenol to 2-(benzyloxy)hydroquinone. With F87V as the catalyst, 0.71 mg ml(-1) 2-(benzyloxy)hydroquinone was produced from 1.0 mg ml(-1) 2-(benzyloxy)phenol in 4 h, with a m	2005	8	2	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Biotechnology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Genetic Engineering; Hydroquinones; Hydroxylation; Mutation; NADP; Phenols; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons	Sulistyaningdyah	Woro Triarsi

PhcA is a transcriptional regulator that activates expression of multiple virulence genes in the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum. Relative to their wild-type parents, phcA mutants overproduced iron-scavenging activity detected with chrome azurol S siderophore detection medium. Transposon mutagenesis of strain AW1-PC (phcA1) generated strain GB6, which was siderophore negative but retained weak iron-scavenging activity. The ssd gene inactivated in GB6 encodes a protein similar to group IV amino acid decarboxylases, and its transcription was repressed by iron(III) and PhcA. ssd is the terminal gene in a putative operon that also appears to encode three siderophore synthetase subunits, a integral membrane exporter, and three genes with no obvious role in siderophore production.

This study is focused on the search for targets and criteria for the design of pasteurization processes for high-acid shelf-stable fruit products, such as juices, nectars, pastes, purees, concentrates, jams, jellies, etc. First, an overview of pasteurization is presented and then, frequently used targets for pasteurization processes are reviewed Enzymes naturally present in fruits, in decreasing order of heat resistance, were pectinesterase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase, and they may be used as pasteurization targets. The heat resistance of each enzyme is strongly dependent on its fruit origin. The most heat resistant micro-organisms capable of spoiling high acid fruit products include ascospores of Neosartorya fischeri, Byssochlamys nivea, Talaromyces flavus, Eupenicillium javanicum, and Byssochlamys fulva moulds, as well as bacterial spores of Clostridium butyricum, Bacillus coagulans, and Bacillus megaterium.

15538387	10.1038/sj.emboj.7600466	Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-LE and PGRP-LC act synergistically in Drosophila immunity.	In innate immunity, pattern recognition molecules recognize cell wall components of microorganisms and activate subsequent immune responses, such as the induction of antimicrobial peptides and melanization in Drosophila. The diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan potently activates imd-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides. Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family members act as pattern recognition molecules. PGRP-LC loss-of-function mutations affect the imd-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides and resistance to Gram-negative bacteria, whereas PGRP-LE binds to the DAP-type peptidoglycan, and a gain-of-function mutation induces constitutive activation of both the imd pathway and melanization. Here, we generated PGRP-LE null mutants and report that PGRP-LE functions synergistically with PGRP-LC in producing resistance to Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium infections, which have the DAP-type peptidoglycan.

The retention times and MS/MS spectra of 11 different standards at 30 eV were collected and compared. The identification of D-ring-hydroxylated progesterones (15beta-, 16alpha-, 17alpha- and 21-OH-P) using ESI-CIDMS was not possible. However, they were separated chromatographically using a 65:35 mixture of water and acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid. The other hydroxylated progesterones (2alpha-, 6beta-, 7beta-, 9alpha-, 11alpha-, 11beta-, and 19-OH-P) could be identified by comparison of eight fragments. The complete separation of 11 standards was achieved chromatographically. The developed assay was evaluated by the identification of monohydroxylated progesterones produced by CYP106A2 from Bacillus mega	2004	12	23	Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom	Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM	Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Cattle; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydroxylation; Progesterone; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization	Kang	Min-Jung
15456220		[Features of solid materials' colonization by pure and mixed cultures of methanotrophs].	The process of colonization of hydrophilic (glass) and hydrophobic (polysterene) carriers by pure cultures of methanotrophs Methylocystis parvus UCM B-3490T, Methylococcus capsulatus UCM B-3030, as well as by their cultures mixed with Bacillus megaterium UCM B 5723T and Pseudomonas putida VKPM B-4188 under the conditions efficient for methanotrophic bacteria. M. parvus demonstrated the highest intensity of this process on the above carriers owing to high hydrophobic cell surface. Both methanotrophs colonized the glass surface more quickly with formation of microcolonies on carriers after 6 days of incubation in pure and mixed cultures with B. megaterium. The number of bacilli on these carriers quickly decreased. In the mixed cultures with P. putida the glass and polysterene colonization intensity decreased, while the amount of pseudomonas on carriers increased.	2005	5	4	Mikrobiol Z	Mikrobiolohichnyi zhurnal (Kiev, Ukraine : 1993)	Bacillus megaterium; Biofilms; Coculture Techniques; Glass; Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria; Gram-Positive Endospore-Forming Bacteria; Methane; Methylococcus capsulatus; Methylocystaceae; Polystyrenes; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas putida; Species Specificity	Kisten'	A G
15447035	10.1667/rr3132	Photoabsorption study of Bacillus megaterium, DNA and related biological materials in the phosphorus K-shell edge region.	We measured the X-ray transmission spectra of several biologically related samples in the phosphorus K-shell edge absorption region. These include red phosphorus, hydrated sodium phosphate (Na(3)PO(4).12 H(2)O), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), diolylphosphatidyl choline (DOPC), and Bacillus megaterium spores. Red phosphorus essentially displays an edge-jump. All other spectra are similar in form and energy position: Each is dominated by a narrower, more intense first peak and a broader but less intense second peak. The corresponding K-shell edge absorption thresholds are shifted toward higher energy relative to that for red phosphorus, as expected for increasing degrees of phosphorus oxidation. The B. megaterium spectrum has aspects common to both the phosphate and DNA spectra and is therefore interpreted as a composite of spectra arising from DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA) and phosphates within the spore.

15380664	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2004.03.031	Metal solubilization from metal-containing solid materials by cyanogenic Chromobacterium violaceum.	Different cyanogenic bacterial strains (Chromobacterium violaceum, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megaterium) were cultivated under cyanide-forming conditions in the presence of metal-containing solids such as nickel powder or electronic scrap. All microorganisms were able to form water-soluble metal cyanides, however, with different efficiencies. C. violaceum was able to mobilize nickel as tetracyanonickelate [Ni(CN)4(2-)] from fine-grained nickel powder. Gold was microbially solubilized as dicyanaoaurate [Au(CN)2-] from electronic waste. Additionally, cyanide-complexed copper was detected during biological treatment of shredded printed circuit boards scrap. Regarding the formation of tetracyanonickelate, C. violaceum was more effective than P. fluorescens or B. megaterium. Besides a few previous reports on gold solubilization from gold-containing ores or native gold by C. violaceum, the findings demonstrate for the first time the microbial mobilization of metals other than gold fr	2004	11	8	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromobacterium; Copper; Cyanates; Cyanides; Gold; Gold Compounds; Industrial Microbiology; Metals; Nickel; Solubility	Faramarzi	Mohammad A

The gene encoding CYP102A2, a novel P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus subtilis, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme formed was purified by immobilised metal chelate affinity chromatography (IMAC) and characterised. CYP102A2 is a 119-kDa self-sufficient monooxygenase, consisting of an FMN/FAD-containing reductase domain and a heme domain. The deduced amino acid sequence of CYP102A2 exhibits a high level of identity with the amino acid sequences of CYP102A1 from B. megaterium (59%) and CYP102A3 from B. subtilis (60%). In reduced, CO-bound form, the enzyme shows a typical Soret band at 449 nm. It catalyses the oxidation of even- and odd-chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. In all reactions investigated, the products were the respective omega-3, omega-2 and omega-1 hydroxylated fatty acids. Activity was highest towards oleic acid (K(M)=17.36+/-1.4 microM, k(cat)=2,244+/-72 min(-1)) and linoleic acid (K(M)=12.25+/-1.8 microM, k(cat)=1,950+/-84 min(-1)	2005	2	22	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression; Substrate Specificity	Budde	M

A microfabricated drift tube for differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) was used with pyrolysis-gas chromatography (py-GC) to chemically characterize bacteria through three-dimensional plots of ion intensity, compensation voltage from differential mobility spectra, and chromatographic retention time. The DMS analyzer provided chemical information for positive and negative ions simultaneously from chemical reactions between pyrolysis products in the GC effluent and reactant ions of H+(H2O)n and O2-(H2O)n in air at ambient pressure. Authentic standards for chemicals formed in the pyrolysis of bacteria showed favorable matches with plots from py-GC/DMS analysis and were supported by py-GC/MS results. These and other yet-unidentified constituents provided a means to distinguish Escherichia coli from Micrococcus luteus.

15369672	10.1016/j.cell.2004.08.027	Structural basis for allosteric control of the transcription regulator CcpA by the phosphoprotein HPr-Ser46-P.	Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is one of the most fundamental environmental-sensing mechanisms in bacteria and imparts competitive advantage by establishing priorities in carbon metabolism. In gram-positive bacteria, the master transcription regulator of CCR is CcpA. CcpA is a LacI-GalR family member that employs, as an allosteric corepressor, the phosphoprotein HPr-Ser46-P, which is formed in glucose-replete conditions. Here we report structures of the Bacillus megaterium apoCcpA and a CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-DNA complex. These structures reveal that HPr-Ser46-P mediates a novel two-component allosteric DNA binding activation mechanism that involves both rotation of the CcpA subdomains and relocation of pivot-point residue Thr61, which leads to juxtaposition of the DNA binding regions permitting "hinge" helix formation in the presence of cognate DNA. The structure of the CcpA-(HPr-Ser46-P)-cre complex also reveals the elegant mechanism by which CcpA family-specific interactions with HP	2004	11	2	Cell	Cell	Allosteric Regulation; Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Histidine; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases; Protein Binding; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Repressor Proteins; Serine; Threonine; Transcription Factors	Schumacher	Maria A

The biotransformation of a series of aliphatic aldehydes (C(8)-C(12)) by Bacillus megaterium isolated from strawberry leaf surfaces was investigated. Products were isolated by liquid/liquid extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS). In addition to aliphatic alcohols and the remaining aldehydes, major transformation products included the corresponding acids as well as 2,3-dialkylacroleins, dehydrated aldol addition products, which were detected for the first time as biotransformation products. To verify the structures, 2,3-dialkylacroleins were chemically synthesized from the appropriate aldehydes by base-catalyzed aldol condensation reactions and characterized by (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. Time-course studies showed that the maximum yield of the acrolein derivatives was obtained after 6 days of incubation.	2004	11	3	J Agric Food Chem	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	Acrolein; Aldehydes; Bacillus megaterium; Biotransformation; Fragaria; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Plant Leaves	Abanda-Nkpwatt	Daniel
15294238	10.1016/j.saa.2003.12.030	Detection of Bacillus endospores using total luminescence spectroscopy.	Detection and analysis of bacteria from environmental samples (e.g. water, air, and food) are usually accomplished by standard culture techniques or by analyses that target specific DNA sequences, antigens or chemicals. For large cell numbers in aqueous suspensions, an alternative technique that has proven useful is total luminescence spectroscopy (TLS). TLS is the acquisition of fluorescence data that records the unique excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of compound fluorophores. Past work has shown that one type of bacterial endospore, Bacillus megaterium, possessed a distinct EEM pattern useful for differentiating it in complex biological fluids and suspensions. The work described here extends those observations to establish some limits on the sensitivity and specificity of TLS for the detection and analysis of bacterial endospores versus (bacterial) vegetative cells in aqueous culture.

The cyanophycin synthetase gene cphA1 encoding the major cyanophycin synthetase (CphA) of Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 was expressed in Escherichia coli conferring so far the highest specific CphA activity to E. coli (6.7 nmol arginine per min and mg protein). CphA1 and cphA genes of Synechocystis sp. strains PCC6803 and PCC6308 and Synechococcus strain MA19 were also expressed in wild types and polyhydroxyalkanoate-negative (PHA) mutants of Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia eutropha. Recombinant strains of these bacteria expressing cphA1 accumulated generally more cyanophycin (23.0 and 20.0% of cellular dry matter, CDM, respectively) than recombinants expressing any other cphA (6.8, 9.0, or 15.8% of CDM for P. putida strains and 7.3, 12.6, or 14.1% of CDM for R. eutropha). Furthermore, PHA-negative mutants of P. putida (9.7, 10.0, 17.5, or 24.0% of CDM) and R. eutropha (8.9, 13.8, 16.0, or 22.0% of CDM) accumulated generally more cyanophycin than the corresponding PHA-positive parent st	2005	2	9	Biomacromolecules	Biomacromolecules	Anabaena; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Cupriavidus necator; DNA; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Hydrochloric Acid; Peptide Synthases; Plant Proteins; Pseudomonas putida; Recombinant Proteins; Species Specificity	Voss	Ingo
15196773	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2004.03.006	Pyruvate formation and suppression in recombinant Bacillus megaterium cultivation.	A recombinant Bacillus megaterium strain showed the ability to secrete large amounts of pyruvate (up to 27.8 gl( -1)) for growth rates larger than 0.15 h(-1). Cultivation below this growth rate avoids pyruvate formation while minimizing acetate and succinate production. Using exponential feeding, final biomass concentrations of up to 80 g l(-1) were achieved. Overall molar yields for the experiments with pyruvate formation were as high as 0.79 mol mol(-1). Pyruvate formation was caused by the discrepancy between glycolytic and pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction/tricarboxylic acid cycle capacities during glucose excess. High pyruvate resulted in deceleration and subsequent cessation of growth. In addition, this inhibitory effect is likely associated with the phoshoenolpyruvate:glucose phosphotransferase system used by B. megaterium as the main importer for glucose.	2005	2	9	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bioreactors; Cell Culture Techniques; Genetic Enhancement; Glucosyltransferases; Pyruvic Acid; Recombination, Genetic; Species Specificity; Sucrose	Hollmann	Rajan

Four species of bacteria were studied: the Gram-negative Escherichia coli and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, and B. megaterium. Under an applied direct current (DC) electric field all the bacterial species exhibited negative dielectrophoretic behavior. The dielectrophoretic separations were carried out in a glass microchannel containing an array of insulating posts. The insulating posts in the microchannel produced nonuniformities in the electric field applied along the channel. Mixtures of two species of bacteria were introduced into the microchannel and the electric field was applied. The bacterial species exhibited different dielectrophoretic mobilities under the influence of the nonuniform field. From these experiments a trapping order was established with E. coli trapping at the weakest applied electric field, while	2004	12	27	Electrophoresis	Electrophoresis	Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Electromagnetic Fields; Electrophoresis; Escherichia coli	Lapizco-Encinas	Blanca H

Two previously uncharacterised products, produced by recombinant CYP106A2 of Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 using progesterone as substrate, were identified. For this purpose a combination of comparative HPLC and electrospray ionisation collision induced dissociation mass spectrometry (ESI CID MS) was established and applied for rapid identification of the steroids, which were identified as 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone and 9alpha-hydroxyprogesterone. The pharmaceutical relevance of these steroids is discussed. Furthermore, the hydroxylation activity was quantified for all monohydroxylation products (15beta-hydroxyprogesterone, 6beta-hydroxyprogesterone, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 9alpha-hydroxyprogesterone). The V(max) values for 15beta-hydroxyprogesterone, 6beta-hydroxyprogesterone, 11alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and 9alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were determined as 337.3+/-43.7, 22.3+/-0.9, 17.5+/-0.9, and 6.5+/-0.3nmol product/min/nmol CYP106A2, respectively.	2004	7	20	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	Bacterial Proteins; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydroxylation; Progesterone; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization	Lisurek	Michael

The fungus Ascosphaera apis, the causative agent of chalkbrood disease in honeybee larvae, occurs throughout the world and is found in many beekeeping areas of Argentina. The potential as biocontrol agents of 249 aerobic spore-forming bacterial antagonists isolated from honey samples was evaluated. Each isolate was screened against A. apis by a central disk test assay. Ten bacterial strains that showed the best antagonistic effect to A. apis were selected for further study and identified as Bacillus cereus (m363, mv86, mv81, mv75), Bacillus circulans (Fr231, m448b), Bacillus megaterium (m435), Bacillus pumilus (m354), Bacillus subtilis (m329), and Paenibacillus alvei (m321).

A 3.8-kb fragment of chromosomal DNA of Geobacillus stearothermophilus V cloned in pSP72 (p1VH) confers resistance to potassium tellurite (K(2)TeO(3)) and to potassium tellurate (K(2)TeO(4)) when the encoded genes are expressed in Escherichia coli K-12.

In addition, E. coli/p1VH cells evolved dimethyl telluride, which was released into the headspace gas above liquid cultures when amended with K(2)TeO(3) or with K(2)TeO(4).

We have explored the utility of expanding FTA filter technology for the preparation of template DNA for PCR from bacterial spores. Isolated spores from several Bacillus spp., B. subtilis, B. cereus, and B. megaterium, were applied to FTA filters, and specific DNA products were amplified by PCR. Spore preparations were examined microscopically to ensure that the presence of vegetative cells, if any, did not yield misleading results. PCR primers SRM86 and SRM87 targeted a conserved region of bacterial rRNA genes, whereas primers Bsub5F and Bsub3R amplified a product from a conserved sequence of the B. subtilis rRNA gene. With the use of the latter set of primers for nested PCR, the sensitivity of the PCR-based assay was increased. Overall, 53 spores could be detected after the first round of PCR, and the sensitivity was increased to five spores by nested PCR.

Bacterial spores of various Bacillus species are impermeable or exhibit low permeability to many compounds that readily penetrate germinated spores, including methylamine. We now show that a lipid probe in the inner membrane of dormant spores of Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis is largely immobile, as measured by fluorescence redistribution after photobleaching, but becomes free to diffuse laterally upon spore germination. The lipid immobility in and the slow permeation of methylamine through the inner membrane of dormant spores may be due to a significant (1.3- to 1.6-fold) apparent reduction of the membrane surface area in the dormant spore relative to that in the germinated spore, but is not due to the dormant spore's high levels of dipicolinic acid and divalent cations.	2004	7	6	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Cell Membrane; Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching; Lipid Metabolism; Microscopy, Confocal; Molecular Probes; Spores, Bacterial; Staining and Labeling	Cowan	Ann E

Bacillus megaterium can produce poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) as carbon and energy storage materials. We now report that the phaQ gene, which is located upstream of the phasin-encoding phaP gene, codes for a new class of transcriptional regulator that negatively controls expression of both phaQ and phaP. A PhaQ binding site that plays a role in this control has been identified by gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting analysis. We have also provided evidence that PhaQ could sense the presence of PHB in vivo and that artificial PHB granules could inhibit the formation of PhaQ-DNA complex in vitro by binding to PhaQ directly. These suggest that PhaQ is a PHB-responsive repressor.	2004	6	10	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; DNA; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Hydroxybutyrates; Operon; Polyesters; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Repressor Proteins; Transcription, Genetic	Lee	Tian-Ren

The cyp102A2 and cyp102A3 genes encoding the two Bacillus subtilis homologues (CYP102A2 and CYP102A3) of flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium have been cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized spectroscopically and enzymologically. Both enzymes contain heme, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactors and bind a variety of fatty acid molecules, as demonstrated by conversion of the low-spin resting form of the heme iron to the high-spin form induced by substrate-binding. CYP102A2 and CYP102A3 catalyze the fatty acid-dependent oxidation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and reduction of artificial electron acceptors at high rates. Binding of carbon monoxide to the reduced forms of both enzymes results in the shift of the heme Soret band to 450 nm, confirming the P450 nature of the enzymes.

15063311	10.1016/j.bbapap.2003.10.003	Electron transfer by diflavin reductases.	Diflavin reductases are enzymes which emerged as a gene fusion of ferredoxin (flavodoxin) reductase and flavodoxin. The enzymes of this family tightly bind two flavin cofactors, FAD and FMN, and catalyze transfer of the reducing equivalents from the two-electron donor NADPH to a variety of one-electron acceptors. Cytochrome P450 reductase (P450R), a flavoprotein subunit of sulfite reductase (SiR), and flavoprotein domains of naturally occurring flavocytochrome fusion enzymes like nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and the fatty acid hydroxylase from Bacillus megaterium are some of the enzymes of this family.

15062997	10.1016/j.peptides.2003.12.012	A napin-like polypeptide from dwarf Chinese white cabbage seeds with translation-inhibitory, trypsin-inhibitory, and antibacterial activities.	Napins are 1:1 disulfide-linked complexes of a smaller (ca. 4kDa) subunit and a larger (ca. 10kDa) subunit. The intent of the present study was to ascertain the production of napin by the seeds of a Brassica species that has not been examined previously, and also to explore new biological activities of the napin. A heterodimeric 11-kDa napin-like polypeptide has been isolated from Chinese white cabbage (Brassica chinensis cv dwarf) seeds with a protocol comprising ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)-ion exchange chromatography on Mono S and FPLC-gel filtration on Superdex 75. The N-terminal sequence of the 7-kDa subunit manifests striking similarity to napin large chain, albumin and trypsin inhibitor. The N-terminal sequence of the 4-kDa subunit is homologous to napin large chain and an antimicrobial peptide.

19712430	10.1016/j.femsec.2003.12.011	Dissemination of TnMERI1-like mercury resistance transposons among Bacillus isolated from worldwide environmental samples.	Fifty-six mercury-resistant (Hg(R)) Bacillus strains were isolated from natural environments at various sites of the world. Southern hybridisation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that 21 of the 56 isolates have closely related or identical mer operons to that of Bacillus megaterium MB1. These 21 isolates displayed a broad-spectrum mercury resistance and volatilised Hg(0). PCR amplification with a single primer and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis showed that these 21 isolates had TnMERI1-like class II transposons. These transposons can be classified into Tn5084, Tn5085, or TnMERI1. From these results, at least three types of class II mercury resistance transposons exist in Hg(R)Bacillus and these transposons may contribute the worldwide distribution and horizontal dissemination of the mer operons among Bacillus strains in natural environments.	2009	9	14	FEMS Microbiol Ecol	FEMS microbiology ecology	Bacillus; Blotting, Southern; Cluster Analysis; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Environmental Microbiology; Gene Order; Genes, Bacterial; Mercury; Molecular Sequence Data; Operon; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology	Narita	Masaru
15024007	10.1074/jbc.M401206200	Replacement of amino acid sequence features of a- and c-subunits of ATP synthases of Alkaliphilic Bacillus with the Bacillus consensus sequence results in defective oxidative phosphorylation and non-fermentative growth at pH 10.5.	Mitchell's (Mitchell, P. (1961) Nature 191, 144-148) chemiosmotic model of energy coupling posits a bulk electrochemical proton gradient (Deltap) as the sole driving force for proton-coupled ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and for other bioenergetic work. Two properties of proton-coupled OXPHOS by alkaliphilic Bacillus species pose a challenge to this tenet: robust ATP synthesis at pH 10.5 that does not correlate with the magnitude of the Deltap and the failure of artificially imposed potentials to substitute for respiration-generated potentials in energizing ATP synthesis at high pH (Krulwich, T. (1995) Mol. Microbiol. 15, 403-410). Here we show that these properties, in alkaliphilic Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4, depend upon alkaliphile-specific features in the proton pathway through the a- and c-subunits of ATP synthase. Site-directed changes were made in six such features to the corresponding sequence in Bacillus megaterium, which reflects the consensus sequence fo	2004	7	23	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Adenosine Triphosphatases; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus; Blotting, Western; Cell Division; Cell Membrane; DNA Primers; Dimaprit; Glucose; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Malates; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Phosphorylation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Species Specificity; Time Factors	Wang	ZhenXiong

Floating pellets containing spores of bacterial biological control agent, Bacillus megaterium were prepared by extrusion-spheronization process. The formulations composed of hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO), lactose, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel(R) PH101), and a disintegrant; cross-linked sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Ac-Di-Sol(R)). The finishing pellets contained bacteria ranging from 10(7) to 10(8) CFU/g and the viability of bacteria in all formulations remained high after 6 months storage. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe endospores of B. megaterium on both the surface and the inside of the pellets. The formulations were tested for their physical properties, floating ability and bacterial release. The level of disintegrant in the formulations influenced the floating ability and the liberation of antagonistic bacteria from pellets.

15020591	10.1074/jbc.M401716200	Flavocytochrome P450 BM3 mutant A264E undergoes substrate-dependent formation of a novel heme iron ligand set.	A conserved glutamate covalently attaches the heme to the protein backbone of eukaryotic CYP4 P450 enzymes. In the related Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3, the corresponding residue is Ala264. The A264E mutant was generated and characterized by kinetic and spectroscopic methods. A264E has an altered absorption spectrum compared with the wild-type enzyme (Soret maximum at approximately 420.5 nm). Fatty acid substrates produced an inhibitor-like spectral change, with the Soret band shifting to 426 nm. Optical titrations with long-chain fatty acids indicated higher affinity for A264E over the wild-type enzyme. The heme iron midpoint reduction potential in substrate-free A264E is more positive than that in wild-type P450 BM3 and was not changed upon substrate binding. EPR, resonance Raman, and magnetic CD spectroscopies indicated that A264E remains in the low-spin state upon substrate binding, unlike wild-type P450 BM3. EPR spectroscopy showed two major species in substrate-free A264E.

15012811	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2004.02196.x	Analysis of the action of compounds that inhibit the germination of spores of Bacillus species.	To determine the mechanism of action of inhibitors of the germination of spores of Bacillus species, and where these inhibitors act in the germination process. Spores of various Bacillus species are significant agents of food spoilage and food-borne disease, and inhibition of spore germination is a potential means of reducing such problems. Germination of the following spores was studied: (i) wild-type B. subtilis spores; (ii) B. subtilis spores with a nutrient receptor variant allowing recognition of a novel germinant; (iii) B. subtilis spores with elevated levels of either the variant nutrient receptor or its wild-type allele; (iv) B. subtilis spores lacking all nutrient receptors and (v) wild-type B. megaterium spores. Spores were germinated with a variety of nutrient germinants, Ca2+-dipicolinic acid (DPA) and dodecylamine for B. subtilis spores, and KBr for B. megaterium spores.

14993310	10.1099/mic.0.26658-0	Complementation of a Delta ccpA mutant of Lactobacillus casei with CcpA mutants affected in the DNA- and cofactor-binding domains.	In low-G+C Gram-positive bacteria, the regulatory protein CcpA has been shown to play a major part in the so-called carbon catabolite repression (CCR) process, as well as in the induction of basic metabolic genes, for which it is considered a global regulator. A strain of Lactobacillus casei that carried a complete deletion of ccpA has been constructed and used to test the effect of CCR on N-acetylglucosaminidase activity and growth performance of a collection of seven CcpA mutations obtained by site-directed mutagenesis. The replaced amino acids were located in the DNA- and cofactor (P-Ser-HPr)-binding domains. Mutations in the DNA-binding domain lacked CCR, as found in Bacillus megaterium. However, mutations in the cofactor-binding domain of L. casei CcpA had a different phenotype to that observed in the previous studies with B. megaterium. Two of them, S80L and T307I, displayed a significant hyper-repression, an effect never reported before for CcpA.

14985331	10.1074/jbc.M313856200	Differential activation of the NF-kappaB-like factors Relish and Dif in Drosophila melanogaster by fungi and Gram-positive bacteria.	The current model of immune activation in Drosophila melanogaster suggests that fungi and Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria activate the Toll/Dif pathway and that Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria activate the Imd/Relish pathway. To test this model, we examined the response of Relish and Dif (Dorsal-related immunity factor) mutants to challenge by various fungi and G(+) and G(-) bacteria. In Relish mutants, the Cecropin A gene was induced by the G(+) bacteria Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus, but not by other G(+) or G(-) bacteria. This Relish-independent Cecropin A induction was blocked in Dif/Relish double mutant flies. Induction of the Cecropin A1 gene by M. luteus required Relish, whereas induction of the Cecropin A2 gene required Dif. Intact peptidoglycan (PG) was necessary for this differential induction of Cecropin A. PG extracted from M. luteus induced Cecropin A in Relish mutants, whereas PGs from the G(+) bacteria Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis did not, suggest	2004	7	21	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Animals; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cell Wall; DNA-Binding Proteins; Drosophila Proteins; Drosophila melanogaster; Fungi; Gene Expression Regulation; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Mutagenesis; NF-kappa B; Transcription Factors	Hedengren-Olcott	Marika
14982790	10.1128/AAC.48.3.961-969.2004	Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.	Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied.

14872291	10.1007/s00253-004-1572-z	Structural and functional characterization of the Bacillus megaterium uvrBA locus and generation of UV-sensitive mutants.	The Bacillus megaterium genes uvrB and uvrA, encoding two subunits of the (A)BC excinuclease, which is responsible for nucleotide excision repair, were isolated and functionally characterized. RNA analyses revealed co-transcription of both genes probably forming a bicistronic operon. Expression of uvrB and uvrA was inducible by the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C. This finding agrees with the presence of a potential DinR box within the uvrBA promoter. Single inactivation of uvrB or uvrA as well as the parallel knockout of both genes resulted in mutants highly sensitive to UV irradiation. Thus, this locus represents an attractive target for generating biologically safe containment strains of B. megaterium.	2004	10	8	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; DNA Damage; DNA Helicases; DNA Repair; DNA, Bacterial; Mitomycin; Mutation; Operon; Transcription, Genetic; Ultraviolet Rays	Nahrstedt	H
14741768	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2003.11.001	Substrate specificity of native and mutated cytochrome P450 (CYP102A3) from Bacillus subtilis.	Within the Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, two monooxygenases (CYP102A2 and CYP102A3) were discovered which revealed a similarity of 76% to the well-known cytochrome P450 BM-3 (CYP102A1) of Bacillus megaterium. All enzymes are natural fusion proteins consisting of a heme domain and a reductase domain. We here report the cloning, expression and characterization of B. subtilis enzyme CYP102A3. The substrate specificity of this enzyme is similar to that of B. megaterium CYP102A1, which hydroxylates medium-chain fatty acids in subterminal positions. A double mutant was prepared that hydroxylates a number of other substrates, which do not bear any resemblance to the natural substrate of this enzyme family.	2004	9	22	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genetic Vectors; Hydroxylation; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Mutation; Substrate Specificity	Lentz	Oliver
14727092	10.1007/s00253-003-1529-7	CYP175A1 from Thermus thermophilus HB27, the first beta-carotene hydroxylase of the P450 superfamily.	The biological function of thermostable P450 monooxygenase CYP175A1 from Thermus thermophilus HB27 was studied by functional complementation in Escherichia coli. The gene product of CYP175A1 added hydroxyl groups to both beta rings of beta-carotene to form zeaxanthin (beta,beta-carotene-3,3'-diol) in E. coli, which produces beta-carotene due to the Erwinia uredovora carotenoid biosynthesis genes. In addition, spectroscopic methods revealed that E. coli carrying CYP175A1 and the cDNA of the Haematococcus pluvialis carotene ketolase was able to synthesise hydroxyechinenone. The predicted amino acid sequence of the enzyme from T. thermophilus does not show substantial similarity with other known beta-carotene hydroxylases, but 41% with the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1, P450 BM3). It is concluded that CYP175 A1 represents a new type of beta-carotene hydroxylase of the P450 superfamily.	2004	8	24	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; DNA, Bacterial; Erwinia; Escherichia coli; Genetic Complementation Test; Isoenzymes; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Thermus thermophilus; Transformation, Genetic; beta Carotene	Blasco	F
14715021	10.1021/bm034281p	Isolation and characterization of gram-positive cyanophycin-degrading bacteria-kinetic studies on cyanophycin depolymerase activity in aerobic bacteria.	This study is the first report on the extracellular degradation of cyanophycin (CGP) by Gram-positive bacteria. Three different Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from forest soil that were able to utilize CGP as the sole carbon source for growth. The isolates were assigned to species of the genera Bacillus and Micromonospora. From one of the isolates, which was taxonomically affiliated as Bacillus megaterium strain BAC19, the extracellular CGP depolymerase (extracellular CGPase; CphEBm) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography and affinity binding to an arginine-agarose column. The purified enzyme was specific for hydrolytic cleavage of CGP, and inhibitor studies indicated that CphEBm is a serine-type peptidase. As CGP degradation products, (beta-Asp-Arg)2 tetrapeptides in addition to beta-Asp-Arg dipeptides occurred, which were identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis.

16943046	10.1016/j.fm.2005.10.004	The functional property of Bacillus for shrimp feeds.	In shrimp cultures, feed represents the most expensive production cost. The quantity and quality of diets are primary factors influencing shrimp growth, nitrogen loading of the culture system and disease proliferation. For these reasons there is an interest in developing 'environmentally friendly' feeds for optimal growth. In this study, Bacillus strains were isolated from marine environments. The isolates were qualitatively assayed for proteases, carbohydrolases and lipases using selective media. The selected strains (9b, 31 and 33) were molecularly identified as Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium and B. megaterium, respectively. Subsequently the strains were grown in an inexpensive culture medium (soybean mineral medium (MMS)). The information generated from the present investigation may contribute towards better feed formulations for shrimp at low cost, including bacterial strains as probiotics.	2006	9	25	Food Microbiol	Food microbiology	Animal Feed; Animals; Aquaculture; Bacillus; Food Microbiology; Penaeidae; Probiotics; Water Microbiology	Leonel Ochoa-Solano	J

The particle size is shown to be sensitive to the use of HClO(4) or HNO(3) as acid catalyst. The gold-capped TiO(2) nanocomposites were processed by the reduction of gold on the surface of the TiO(2) nanoparticles via a chemical reduction or a photoreduction method. Different percentages of vanadium-doped TiO(2) nanoparticles, which extended the TiO(2) absorption wavelength from the ultraviolet to the visible region, were successfully prepared. The synthesized nanocomposites have a size of about 12-18 nm and an anatase phase as characterized by XRD, TEM, AFM, and UV-vis spectroscopy. The TiO(2) nanocomposite coatings have been applied on glass slide substrates. The antibacterial activity of TiO(2) nanocomposites was investigated qualitatively and quantitatively.

WS06, which produces an extracellular alpha-amylase, was isolated from the cecum in a piglet. An amyF gene from this Bacillus strain was cloned and its nucleotide sequence was determined. An open reading frame composed of 1581 bases, which encodes 526 amino acid residues was found. The amyF gene shows high sequence homologies with other microbial amylase genes, such as Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus polymyxa (93% and 53% identity). The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that four highly conserved regions of the alpha-amylase family. The amyF gene was overepressed using the pET21a vector and Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The recombinant enzyme was purified 22.2 fold to electrophoretic homogeneity and had a molecular mass of 57kD (by SDS-PAGE).

Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), an enzyme central to homoethanol fermentation, catalyses the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde with release of carbon dioxide. PDC enzymes from diverse organisms have different kinetic properties, thermal stability and codon usage that are likely to offer unique advantages for the development of desirable Gram-positive biocatalysts for use in the ethanol industry. To examine this further, pdc genes from bacteria to yeast were expressed in the Gram-positive host Bacillus megaterium. The PDC activity and protein levels were determined for each strain. In addition, the levels of pdc-specific mRNA transcripts and stability of recombinant proteins were assessed. From this analysis, the pdc gene of Gram-positive Sarcina ventriculi was found to be the most advantageous for engineering high-level synthesis of PDC in a Gram-positive host.

We have developed a statistical method named MAP (mutagenesis assistant program) to equip protein engineers with a tool to develop promising directed evolution strategies by comparing 19 mutagenesis methods. Instead of conventional transition/transversion bias indicators as benchmarks for comparison, we propose to use three indicators based on the subset of amino acid substitutions generated on the protein level: (1) protein structure indicator; (2) amino acid diversity indicator with a codon diversity coefficient; and (3) chemical diversity indicator.

Spore formation is a sophisticated mechanism by which some bacteria survive conditions of stress and starvation by producing a multilayered protective capsule enclosing their condensed DNA. Spores are highly resistant to damage by heat, radiation, and commonly employed antibacterial agents. Previously, spores have also been shown to be resistant to photodynamic inactivation using dyes and light that easily destroy the corresponding vegetative bacteria. We have discovered that Bacillus spores are susceptible to photoinactivation by phenothiazinium dyes and low doses of red light. Dimethylmethylene blue, methylene blue, new methylene blue, and toluidine blue O are all effective, while alternative photosensitizers such as Rose Bengal, polylysine chlorin(e6) conjugate, a tricationic porphyrin, and a benzoporphyrin derivative, which easily kill vegetative cells, are ineffective.

Of the 29 isolates, seven had nifH gene determined by PCR amplification. The seven isolates were found to belong to the genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus based on phenotypic characterization, 16S rDNA sequence, G+C content and DNA-DNA hybridization. Isolates T1 and W5 were identified as Bacillus cereus and Bacillus marisflavi respectively. Isolates G1, C4 and C5 were identified as Bacillus megaterium. Isolate G2 was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and isolate T7 as Paenibacillus massiliensis. This study suggests that nifH gene could be detected in the both genera Bacillus and Paenibacillus. These degenerate primers for nifH gene fragment used in this study were shown to be usefu	2006	2	16	J Appl Microbiol	Journal of applied microbiology	Bacillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacterial Proteins; China; Culture Media; DNA, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Lolium; Magnoliopsida; Nitrogen; Nitrogenase; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Oxidoreductases; Phenotype; Phylogeny; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salix; Temperature; Triticum; Zea mays	Ding	Y
16212035		Purification of bovine milk lactoperoxidase and investigation of antibacterial properties at different thiocyanate mediated.	Bovine lactoperoxidase (LPO) was purified with amberlite CG 50 H+ resin, CM sephadex C-50 ion-exchange chromatography, and sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography from skim milk. The activity of lactoperoxidase was measured by using 2.2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6 sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) as a choromogenic substrate at pH 6.0. Purification degree for the purified enzyme was controlled with SDS-PAGE and Rz value (A412/A280). Rz value for the purified LPO was 0.8. Km value at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C for the LPO was 0.20 mM. Vmax value was 7.87 micromol/ml min at pH 6.0 at 20 degrees C. Bovine LPO showed high antibacterial activity in 100 mM thiocyanate--100 mM H2O2 medium for some pathogenic bacteria, such as Aeromonas hydrophila ATCC 7966, Micrococcus luteus LA 2971, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Bacillus subtilis var. niger ATCC 10, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 15753, Bacillus brevi	2006	1	24	Prikl Biokhim Mikrobiol	Prikladnaia biokhimiia i mikrobiologiia	Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cattle; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lactoperoxidase; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Milk; Thiocyanates	U..uz	M T
16201802	10.1021/ja0438314	Observation of ligand binding to cytochrome P450 BM-3 by means of solid-state NMR spectroscopy.	A broad understanding of the binding modes of ligands and inhibitors to cytochrome P450 is vital for the development of new drugs. We investigated ligand binding in a site-specific fashion on cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium, a 119 kDa paramagnetic enzyme, using solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance methods. Selective labeling and longitudinal relaxation effects were utilized to identify the peaks in a site-specific fashion and to provide evidence for binding. Well-resolved one-dimensional and two-dimensional NMR spectra of cytochrome P450 BM-3 reveal shifts upon binding of its substrate, N-palmitoylglycine. These data are consistent with the crystallographic result that a biochemically important amino acid residue, Phe87, moves upon ligation. This experimental scheme provides a tool for probing ligand binding for complex systems.	2006	1	11	J Am Chem Soc	Journal of the American Chemical Society	Bacillus megaterium; Carbon Isotopes; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Ligands; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Reference Standards	Jovanovic	Tijana

Germination protease (GPR) initiates the degradation of small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASP) during germination of spores of Bacillus and Clostridium species. The GPR amino acid sequence is not homologous to members of the major protease families, and previous work has not identified residues involved in GPR catalysis. The current work has focused on identifying catalytically essential amino acids by mutagenesis of Bacillus megaterium gpr. A residue was selected for alteration if it (i) was conserved among spore-forming bacteria, (ii) was a potential nucleophile, and (iii) had not been ruled out as inessential for catalysis. GPR variants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the active form (P41) was assayed for activity against SASP and the zymogen form (P46) was assayed for the ability to autoprocess to P41. Variants inactive against SASP and unable to autoprocess were analyzed by circular dichroism spectroscopy and multi-angle laser light scattering to determine whether t	2005	11	15	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Amino Acid Sequence; Aspartic Acid; Bacillus megaterium; Endopeptidases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Spores, Bacterial	Carroll	Thomas M
16176269	10.1111/j.1742-4658.2005.04906.x	Isolation and identification of antimicrobial components from the epidermal mucus of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).	The epidermal mucus of fish species has been found to contain antimicrobial proteins and peptides, which is of interest in regard to fish immunity. An acidic extract from the epidermal mucus of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) was found to exhibit antimicrobial activity against Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans. This activity varied significantly when salt was added to the antimicrobial assay, and was eliminated by pepsin digestion. No lysozyme activity was detected in the extract. By using weak cationic exchange chromatography together with reversed-phase chromatography, and monitoring the antimicrobial activity, we have isolated four cationic proteins from the mucus extract. Using N-terminal and C-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, together with MS, the antimicrobial proteins were identified as histone H2B (13 565 Da), ribosomal protein L40 (6397 Da), ribosomal protein L36A (12 340 Da) and ribosomal protein L35 (14 215 Da).

Two bacterial strains, designated D-1,5a(T) and D-1,5b, were isolated from a medieval wall painting in the chapel of Castle Herberstein, Styria (Austria). The Gram-positive, heterotrophic, aerobic, spore-forming rods showed nearly identical whole-cell protein patterns, identical genomic fingerprints and identical physiological profiles, demonstrating their relationship at the species level. Both strains contained meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan, possessed a quinone system comprising menaquinone MK-7 and had fatty acid profiles in which C(15:0) iso and C(15:0) anteiso were predominant. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of D-1,5a(T) showed the highest similarity (99.5%) to the sequence of Bacillus sp.

16165191	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2005.08.004	Toxicological effect of indole and its azo dye derivatives on some microorganisms under aerobic conditions.	Azo dyes are ubiquitous commercial chemicals that present unique environmental problems. The azo dyes in particular can undergo natural anaerobic degradation to potentially carcinogenic amines. They pose a major problem for water-treatment plants downstream. One strategy to remidate polluted surface contaminants is to make use of the degradative capacity of bacteria rather than using destructive chemical reactions. Therefore, pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms namely; Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been chosen and the toxicological effect of indole and its azo dye methyl derivatives on these microorganisms was studied under aerobic conditions. While these compounds have showed remarkable activity against B. megaterium, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis and S. aureus, they did not exhibit any activity against P. vulgaris.

16143653	10.1152/ajpheart.00516.2005	Regulation of potassium channels in coronary smooth muscle by adenoviral expression of cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase.	Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are endothelium-derived cytochrome P-450 (CYP) metabolites of arachidonic acid that relax vascular smooth muscle by large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK(Ca)) channel activation and membrane hyperpolarization. We hypothesized that if smooth muscle cells (SMCs) had the capacity to synthesize EETs, endogenous EET production would increase BK(Ca) channel activity. Bovine coronary SMCs were transduced with adenovirus coding the CYP Bacillus megaterium -3 (F87V) (CYP BM-3) epoxygenase that metabolizes arachidonic acid exclusively to 14(S),15(R)-EET. Adenovirus containing the cytomegalovirus promoter-Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase was used as a control. With the use of an anti-CYP BM-3 (F87V) antibody, a 124-kDa immunoreactive protein was detected only in CYP BM-3-transduced cells. Protein expression increased with increasing amounts of virus.

16116285	10.1271/bbb.69.1555	Production of hydroxycitric acid by microorganisms.	Hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is a major acid component of the tropical plants Garcinia cambogia and Hibiscus subdariffa. (2S,3S)-HCA from G. cambogia was shown to be a potent inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase (EC4.1.3.8), which catalyzes the extramitochondrial cleavage of citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. (2S,3R)-HCA from H. subdariffa inhibits alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, leading to reduction of carbohydrate metabolism. The availability of HCA is limited by the restricted habitat of the plants as well as the difficulty of stereoselective organic synthesis. Hence, we screened microorganisms producing HCA to find an alternative source of optically pure bulk HCA. Two strains, Streptomyces sp. U121 and Bacillus megaterium G45C, were screened by HPLC analysis. Particular metabolites were purified from their culture broths and compared with authentic HCA from plants. NMR studies indicated that the products are identical to Hibiscus-type HCA.

In previous studies, a new microbial strain ALA2 was isolated which produced many new products from linoleic acid [Gardner H.W., Hou C.T., Weisleder D. and Brown W. 2000. Lipids 35: 1055-1060; Hou C.T. 1998. 12,13,17-Trihydroxy-9(Z)-Octodecenoic acid and derivatives and microbial isolate for production of the acid. US Patent No. 5, 852, 196]. Strain ALA2 was preliminary identified as Clavibacter sp. based on its physiological and fatty acid profiles. To determine if strain ALA2 is the optimal strain for industrial applications, other related strains were screened for their abilities to convert linoleic acids. Two strains from Clavibacter and 20 type strains from the phylogenetically related genus Microbacterium were studied. Surprisingly, all of these strains tested showed very little or no activity in converting linoleic acid. On reexamination of the identification of strain ALA2, the sequence of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of ALA2 was found to be 99% identical to that of Bacillus mega	2005	11	29	Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek	Antonie van Leeuwenhoek	Actinomycetales; Bacillus megaterium; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids; Genes, rRNA; Hydroxylation; Linoleic Acid; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Hou	Ching T
16042591	10.1042/BST0330747	Flavocytochrome P450 BM3: an update on structure and mechanism of a biotechnologically important enzyme.	Since its discovery in the 1980s, the fatty acid hydroxylase flavocytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450) BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium has been adopted as a paradigm for the understanding of structure and mechanism in the P450 superfamily of enzymes. P450 BM3 was the first P450 discovered as a fusion to its redox partner--a eukaryotic-like diflavin reductase. This fact fuelled the interest in soluble P450 BM3 as a model for the mammalian hepatic P450 enzymes, which operate a similar electron transport chain using separate, membrane-embedded P450 and reductase enzymes. Structures of each of the component domains of P450 BM3 have now been resolved and detailed protein engineering and molecular enzymology studies have established roles for several amino acids in, e.g. substrate binding, coenzyme selectivity and catalysis. The potential of P450 BM3 for biotechnological applications has also been recognized, with variants capable of industrially important transformations generated usin	2005	12	14	Biochem Soc Trans	Biochemical Society transactions	Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biotechnology; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Mammals; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Models, Molecular; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Conformation; Protein Engineering; Rats	Warman	A J

The removal of the signal peptide from a precursor protein is a crucial step of protein secretion. In order to improve Bacillus megaterium as protein production and secretion host, the influence of homologous type I signal peptidase SipM overproduction on recombinant Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase DsrS synthesis and export was investigated. The dsrS gene was integrated as a single copy into the chromosomal bgaM locus encoding beta-galactosidase. Desired clones were identified by blue-white selection. In this strain, the expression of sipM from a multicopy plasmid using its own promoter increased the amount of secreted DsrS 3.7-fold. This increase in protein secretion by SipM overproduction was next transferred to a high level DsrS production strain using a multicopy plasmid encoding sipM with its natural promoter and dsrS under control of a strong xylose-inducible promoter. No further increase in DsrS export were observed when this vector was carrying two sipM copies.

Wild-type cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (P450 BM-3) has a low hydroxylation activity for beta-ionone (&lt;1 min(-1)). Substitution of phenylalanine by valine at position 87 led to a more than 100-fold increase in beta-ionone hydroxylation activity (115 min(-1)). Enzyme activity could be further increased by both site-directed and random mutagenesis. The mutant R47L Y51F F87V, designed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the mutant A74E F87V P386S, obtained after two rounds of error-prone polymerase chain reaction, exhibited an increase in activity of up to 300-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. The triple mutant R47 LY51F F87V exhibited moderate enantioselectivity, forming (R)-4-hydroxy-beta-ionone with an optical purity of 39%. All mutants regioselectively converted beta-ionone into 4-hydroxy-beta-ionone.

Two catabolic enzymes, phosphofructokinase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, responded differentially in fungi and bacteria against sublethal concentrations of the compound when assayed from their cell free extracts. An increased specific activity of the enzymes in bacteria and a decrease activity in fungi indicate a possible different mechanism of inhibition of saponins on the organisms tested.	2005	9	1	Fitoterapia	Fitoterapia	Acacia; Anti-Infective Agents; Aspergillus; Bacillus megaterium; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mitosporic Fungi; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Salmonella typhimurium; Saponins	Mandal	P

A thermostable glucose dehydrogenase (GlcDH) mutant of Bacillus megaterium IWG3 harboring the Q252L substitution (Y. Makino, S. Negoro, I. Urabe, and H. Okada, J. Biol. Chem. 264:6381-6385, 1989) is stable at pH values above 9, but only in the presence of 2 M NaCl. Another GlcDH mutant exhibiting increased stability at an alkaline pH in the absence of NaCl has been isolated previously (S.-H. Baik, T. Ide, H. Yoshida, O. Kagami, and S. Harayama, Appl. Microbiol.

In the present study, we characterized three GlcDH mutants harboring the substitutions Q252L, E170K, and Q252L/E170K under low-salt conditions. The GlcDH mutant harboring two substitutions, Q252L/E170K, was stable, but mutants harboring a single substitution, either Q252L or E170K, were unstable at an alkaline pH.

15933003	10.1128/AEM.71.6.3068-3076.2005	Molecular characterization of plasmid pBM300 from Bacillus megaterium QM B1551.	Strain QM B1551 of Bacillus megaterium contains seven compatible plasmids: two small rolling circle plasmids and five theta-replicating plasmids with cross-hybridizing replicons. To expand our understanding of these plasmids, the replicon region (6.7 kb) from pBM300 was cloned, sequenced, and functionally characterized. Sequence analysis showed that the replication protein (RepM300) was highly homologous to two other plasmid Rep proteins of the same strain but to no other known proteins. Furthermore, the location of the replication origin was within the RepM300 coding region, and the origin contained three 12-base direct repeats. Deletion analysis of the replicon confirmed the role of the Rep protein and showed that open reading frame 2 (ORF2) was required for stability. However, the protein encoded by ORF2 is entirely different from the replicon stability proteins encoded by the other two replicons.

Beta-glucans were prepared from Agaricus blazei Murill by repeated extraction with hot water. The average molecular weights of beta-glucans were 30-50 kDa by gel filtration chromatography. Oligosaccharides (AO), derived from hydrolyzing beta-glucans with an endo-beta-(1--&gt;6)-glucanase from Bacillus megaterium, were mainly di- and tri-saccharides. Though beta-glucans and AO both showed anti-hyperglycemic, anti-hypertriglyceridemic, anti-hypercholesterolemic, and anti-arteriosclerotic activity indicating overall anti-diabetic activity in diabetic rats, AO had about twice the activity of beta-glucans with respect to anti-diabetic activity.	2005	9	15	Biotechnol Lett	Biotechnology letters	Agaricus; Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Cholesterol; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Disaccharides; Glycoside Hydrolases; Hypoglycemic Agents; Hypolipidemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Secretion; Molecular Weight; Oligosaccharides; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Triglycerides; Trisaccharides; beta-Glucans	Kim	Yea-Woon

A recombinant B. megaterium strain was used for the heterologous production of a glucosyltransferase (dextransucrase). To better understand the physiological and metabolic responses of the host cell to cultivation and induction conditions, proteomic analysis was carried out by combined use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (2-DE/MS) for protein separation and identification. 2-DE method was optimized for the separation of intracellular proteins. Since the genome of B. megaterium is not yet available, peptide sequencing using peptide fragment information obtained from nanoelectrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-QqTOF MS/MS) was applied for protein identification. 167 protein spots were identified as 149 individual proteins, including most enzymes involved in the central carbon metabolic pathways and many enzymes related to amino acid synthesis and protein synthesis.

15907227		Uranium uptake by some locally isolated and some reference bacterial species.	In the present study, uranium absorption capacity of Bacillus pantothenticus and Bacillus megaterium, previously isolated from the environmental air surrounding the 60Co gamma source, is reported. Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas chlororaphis were used as reference species. Concerning uranium uptake, the local species were more efficient than the reference ones. The maximum uptake of uranium was achieved by B. megaterium and P. chlororaphis at 20 microg U mL(-1) and by B. pantothenticus at 30 microg U mL(-1). The transmission electron microscope examination indicated that uranium was absorbed onto the cell surface of the studied isolates. Furthermore, the increase in biomass concentration has shown an increase in the total amount of uranium removed. Dead cells exhibited uranium uptake to the same or greater extent than living cells. B. pantothenticus, P. putida, and P. chlororaphis achieved maximum uptake at pH 4.0, whereas for B. megaterium it was at pH 6.0.

From the seeds of haricot beans (Phaseolus vulgaris), an antifungal peptide with a molecular mass around 7 kDa was purified by using a simple protocol consisting of affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel and gel filtration on Superdex 75. This peptide named vulgarinin manifested an antifungal activity toward fungal species such as Fusarium oxysporum, Mycosphaerella arachidicola, Physalospora piricola and Botrytis cinerea, and an antibacterial action on Mycobacterium phlei, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris. It also inhibited proliferation in leukemia cell lines L1210 and M1 and breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This peptide could reduce the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and inhibited translation in a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system.

15895222	10.1007/s00253-005-1999-x	Effect of environmental factors on the production of oxygenated unsaturated fatty acids from linoleic acids by Bacillus megaterium ALA2.	We identified many novel oxygenated fatty acids produced from linoleic acid by Bacillus megaterium ALA2: 12,13,17-trihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (12,13,17-THOA); 12,13,16-trihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (12,13,16-THOA); 12-hydroxy-13,16-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid; and 12,17;13,17-diepoxy-16-hydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid. 12,13,17-THOA, the main product, has antiplant pathogenic fungal activity. To develop an industrial process for the production of these new oxygenated fatty acids by strain ALA2, the effect of environmental factors on the production and their impact on the amount of various products were studied. Dextrose at 5 g/l was the optimum amount for the carbon source. A combination of 15 g yeast extract and 10 g tryptone showed good results as nitrogen sources. Among the metal ions tested, the optimum concentrations for the reaction for the different ions were as follows (in mM): magnesium 2.0, iron 0.5, zinc 0.1, nickel 0.01, and cobalt 0.05.

Lactic acid bacteria have an inefficient proteolytic system. Therefore, cultivation media which may have high protein content are usually supplemented with yeast extract or protein lysates (peptones). These additives might be conveniently replaced by in situ treatment of the cultivation medium with proteolytic enzymes or proteolytic microbes. Lactobacillus salivarius ssp. salicinius, a lactic acid bacterium species that can grow at high salt concentration, was used to ferment lactic acid in cheese whey (with 3 gl(-1) whey protein content) and lactose mother liquor (90 gl(-1) lactose, 9 gl(-1) proteins, 30 gl(-1) minerals). The contribution of protease enzymes or proteolytic microbes to acid production by lactobacilli was examined. Efficient conversion of lactose to lactic acid was obtained in the presence of additional proteolytic activity. Fastest acid production was obtained with the addition of protease enzymes.

15859069		Calf antibiotic and sulfonamide test (CAST) for screening antibiotic and sulfonamide residues in calf carcasses.	The Calf Antibiotic and Sulfonamide Test (CAST), a microbial inhibition screening test, was developed for detecting antibiotics and sulfonamides in bob veal calf carcasses. The test uses Bacillus megaterium ATCC 9885 as the indicator organism and Mueller Hinton agar as the growth medium. Compared to Swab Test on Premises (STOP), developed in 1970, this screening test has higher sensitivity and the ability to detect a wider range of veterinary antimicrobial residual drugs, particularly sulfonamides, at lower concentrations. Carcasses that are tested with CAST and suspected of containing chemical residue above tolerance level are retained for confirmation. Disposition of these carcasses are determined upon laboratory result. Routine testing of bob veal calves with CAST allowed the Food Safety and Inspection Service to release most calf carcasses within 24 h post-slaughter, thus conserving shipping and handling resources.

An extracellular lipase isolated from Bacillus megaterium AKG-1 had an optimum activity at 55 degrees C/pH 7.0. It retained 100% activity at 50 degrees C for 30 min with a half life of 30 min at 70 degrees C. A 20-70% increase in lipase activity was observed in presence of acetone (20% v/v), DMSO (20% v/v) and isopropanol (10% v/v). The enzyme activity was 92, 98 and 107% after 24 h, on treatment with 10% (v/v) acetone, benzene and isopropanol respectively. Deoxycholic acid, sodium deoxycholate, lithocholic acid, rhamnolipid, Brij 52 and cholic acid stimulated the lipase activity by 76, 36, 24, 24, 23.6 and 13%, respectively. Addition of reducing agents like sodium sulphite, sodium metabisulphite and L-cysteine-HCl, at 10 mM concentration stimulated lipase activity by 127, 146 and 150% respectively. The lipase appeared to show enantioselectivity in hydrolyzing racemic 3-acetoxy-beta-lactam as it hydrolyzed only the (+) enantiomer.	2005	6	7	J Basic Microbiol	Journal of basic microbiology	Bacillus megaterium; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ions; Lipase; Metals; Soil Microbiology; Solvents; Surface-Active Agents; Time Factors	Sekhon	Anurag

Concentrated conditioned medium (CM) fractions from Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 and Trichoplusia ni cells, eluting from a gel filtration column at around 10 kDa, were found to exhibit strong antibacterial activity against Bacillus megaterium and Escherichia coli. The B. megaterium cells incubated in the CM fraction from Sf9 cells rapidly lost viability: after 8 min the viability had decreased to 0.7%, as compared with the control. Addition of the CM fraction to E. coli cells resulted in a less drastic drop in viability: 65% viability was lost after 60 min of incubation. Further, exposure to the CM fraction caused a substantial leakage of intracellular proteins, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE analysis. Cell lysis was confirmed by optical density measurements, microscopic investigations and flow cytometry. B. megaterium exposed to a CM fraction from T. ni cells lost 97% of their viability in about 40 min.

The aim of the investigation reported in this paper was to identify the bacterial microflora on monetary coinage from 17 countries by employment of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequenced-based molecular identification of rDNA from bacterial cultures. Silver, bronze, and other alloy coins (approximately 300 g) from 17 currencies were enriched individually by aerobic culturing in tryptone soya broth for 72 hours at 30 degrees C. Next, 20 microL of broth was inoculated onto Columbia blood agar supplemented with 5 percent volume-pervolume (v/v) defibrinated horse blood for 72 hours at 30 degrees C, and resulting colonies were purified by further subculture, as detailed above, for a further 72 hours. All colonies were identified by initial PCR amplification of a partial region of the 16S rDNA gene locus, which was then sequenced, and the sequence was aligned according to the BLASTn algorithm.

15782292	10.1007/s00253-005-1930-5	Test systems to study transcriptional regulation and promoter activity in Bacillus megaterium.	Plasmid-located (multi-copy) and chromosomally located (single-copy) promoter test systems were developed for Bacillus megaterium by making use of the homologous beta-galactosidase-encoding bgaM gene. The multi-copy system facilitates rapid promoter analyses and promoter trapping, whereas the single-copy system, integrated into the chromosome, allows investigation of tightly regulated promoters. As a prerequisite for both the multi- and the single-copy systems, a beta-galactosidase-deficient B. megaterium strain was generated by deletion mutagenesis. Both test systems were verified using the promoter of the xylose operon (P( xylA )) from B. megaterium along with its repressor (XylR). As expected, expression levels in the two systems differed significantly, although expression of the bgaM reporter gene was induced by xylose in both cases, thereby proving the functionality of both the multi- and the single-copy system.	2006	2	8	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Regulator; Genetic Vectors; Operon; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription, Genetic; Xylose; beta-Galactosidase	Schmidt	Silke

Jet-loop type reactors developed in our group have been successfully used for biological treatment of winery and olive oil wastewaters. The objective of the present work was to study the influence of the reactor hydrodynamics, causing high shear stress applied on the nozzle and its influence on the composition of the microbial population. Winery and olive oil industry effluents were treated and analysed. Microbial consortia were enriched and selected under different bio-treatment conditions of the effluents. In the case of the winery wastewaters, the isolates identified belong to the genera of Pseudomonas and Bacillus. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also present in the consortia but no filamentous fungi were detected. In the case of the olive oil wastewaters, Bacillus megaterium 2 was the predominant microorganism. It was not detected any type of fungi.	2005	6	3	Water Sci Technol	Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	Agriculture; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Industrial Waste; Olive Oil; Plant Oils; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Movements; Wine	Eus..bio	A
15758224	10.1099/mic.0.27626-0	Evidence for two recA genes mediating DNA repair in Bacillus megaterium.	Isolation and subsequent knockout of a recA-homologous gene in Bacillus megaterium DSM 319 resulted in a mutant displaying increased sensitivity to mitomycin C. However, this mutant did not exhibit UV hypersensitivity, a finding which eventually led to identification of a second functional recA gene. Evidence for recA duplicates was also obtained for two other B. megaterium strains. In agreement with potential DinR boxes located within their promoter regions, expression of both genes (recA1 and recA2) was found to be damage-inducible. Transcription from the recA2 promoter was significantly higher than that of recA1. Since a recA2 knockout could not be achieved, functional complementation studies were performed in Escherichia coli. Heterologous expression in a RecA null mutant resulted in increased survival after UV irradiation and mitomycin C treatment, proving both recA gene products to be functional in DNA repair. Thus, there is evidence for an SOS-like pathway in B. megaterium that 	2005	6	20	Microbiology (Reading)	Microbiology (Reading, England)	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA Damage; DNA Repair; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Rec A Recombinases; SOS Response, Genetics; Ultraviolet Rays	Nahrstedt	Hannes

15748809	10.1016/j.micpath.2004.12.002	Comparison of wild type with recombinant Clostridium difficile toxin A.	Toxins A and B from Clostridium difficile are single-chain proteins of 308,000 and 270,000 Da, respectively. They possess transferase activity to monoglucosylate proteins of the Rho GTPase family whereby Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 are the canonical substrates. For application of these toxins as specific Rho GTPase inhibitors the highest possible purity is of crucial interest. We, therefore, expressed recombinant His-tagged toxin A using the Bacillus megaterium expression system. Specific antisera raised against the native toxin A from C. difficile and the recombinant toxin, respectively, showed identical sensitivity and specificity in Western blot and ELISA analyses towards both toxins. By comparison of both toxins in functional studies we showed that the recombinant toxin was about two times more cytotoxic than the native toxin, and the glucosyltransferase-activity of the recombinant toxin was even 10-fold increased.

Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium catalyzed NADPH-supported indole hydroxylation under alkaline conditions with homotropic cooperativity toward indole. The activity was also found with the support of H2O2, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBuOOH), or cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH). Enhanced activity and heterotropic cooperativity were observed in CuOOH-supported hydroxylation, and both the Hill coefficient and substrate concentration required for half-maximal activity in the CuOOH-supported reaction were much lower than those in the H2O2-, tBuOOH-, or NADPH-supported reactions. CuOOH greatly enhanced NADPH consumption and indole hydroxylation in the NADPH-supported reaction. However, when CuOOH was replaced by tBuOOH or H2O2, heterotropic cooperativity was not observed. Spectral studies also confirmed that CuOOH stimulated indole binding to P450 BM-3. Interestingly, a mutant enzyme with enhanced indole-hydroxylation activity, F87V (Phe87 was replaced by Val), lost homotropic coopera	2005	7	19	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry	Allosteric Regulation; Bacillus megaterium; Benzene Derivatives; Binding Sites; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydroxylation; Indoles; NADP; Point Mutation	Li	Qing-Shan

We isolated a novel protease that converts plasminogen to angiostatin-like fragments (BL-angiostatins) from a culture of Bacillus megaterium A9542 through a single-step chromatography on CM-cellulose. The protease, designated bacillolysin MA (BL-MA), belongs to a family of neutral metalloproteinases based on the nucleotide sequence of its gene. At an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:540, BL-MA cleaved human plasminogen mainly at Ser441-Val442 to form BL-angiostatin and miniplasminogen with a K(m) of 3.0 +/- 0.8 microM and a k(cat) of 0.70 +/- 0.09 s(-1). The resulting BL-angiostatins inhibited the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells at concentrations of 1-10 microg/ml. Although BL-MA failed to activate plasminogen, it increased urokinase-catalyzed activation of plasminogen caused by production of miniplasminogen, which is highly susceptible to activation.

Strains of B. megaterium, B. firmus and B. simplex were found to produce novel heat-stable toxins, which showed varying levels of toxicity. B. cereus strains (18 out of 54) were positive for toxin production. Thirteen were of serovar H1, and it was of interest that some were of clinical origin. Two were of serovars 17B and 20, which are not usually implicated in the emetic syndrome.

The aims of the present work were to solubilize the abundantly expressed recombinant xylulokinase in Escherichia coli and to develop a reliable xylulokinase assay. Three mutants of xylulokinase of Bacillus megaterium that were expressed at high level but formed insoluble protein in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS were selected for solubility study. The solubility of xylulokinase increased eight to 77-fold after introduction of molecular chaperones GroEL-GroES into the host. This investigation reports that GroEL-GroES minimizes the formation of insoluble protein in three highly expressed recombinant xylulokinases and an improved xylulokinase assay. Commercial production of bioethanol is critically dependent on the development of an efficient and low-cost process of enzymatic conversion of xylan, a major component in lignocellulose biomass, to xylulose-5-phosphate, which can then be channelled into pentose phosphate pathway and metabolized to ethanol.

Leuconostoc mesenteroides dextransucrase DsrS was recombinantly produced in Bacillus megaterium and exported into the growth medium. For this purpose a plasmid-based xylose-inducible gene expression system was optimized via introduction of a multiple cloning site and an encoded optimal B. megaterium ribosome binding site. A cre mediating glucose-dependent catabolite repression was removed. Recombinant DsrS was found in the cytoplasm and exported via its native leader sequence into the growth medium. Elimination of the extracellular protease NprM increased extracellular DsrS concentrations by a factor of 4 and stabilized the recombinant protein for up to 12 h. Cultivation in a semi-defined medium resulted in a further doubling of extracellular DsrS concentration up to an activity of 65 Units/L. To develop an industrial process a high cell density cultivation of B. megaterium was established yielding cell dry weights of up to 80 g/L.

Six species of lichens, such as Usnea florida, Usnea barbata, Usnea longissima, Usnea rigida, Usnea hirta and Usnea subflorida, were collected from different areas of Anatolia (district of Antalya, Karab..k, Qankiri, Giresun and Trabzon) in Turkey. Their usnic acid amounts in acetone extracts were determined by HPLC. In addition, antimicrobial activities of these extracts were determined against Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Enterococcus faecalis (RSKK 508), Proteus mirabilis (Pasteur Ens. 235), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. It was shown that with increasing amount of usnic acid, the antimicrobial activity increased. Usnic acid contents of Usnea species varied between 0.22-6.49% of dry weight.	2007	3	6	Z Naturforsch C J Biosci	Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

Site-directed mutagenesis based on predicted modeled structure of pencillin G acylase from Bacillus megaterium (BmPGA) was followed to increase its performance in the kinetically controlled synthesis of cephalexin with high reactant concentrations of 133 mM 7-amino-desaceto-xycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA) and 267 mM D: -phenylglycine amide (D-PGA). We directed changes in amino acid residues to positions close to the active site that were expected to affect the catalytic performance of penicillin acylase: alpha Y144, alpha F145, and beta V24. Alpha F145 was mutated into tyrosine, alanine, and leucine. Alpha Y144 and beta V24 were mutated into arginine and phenylalanine, respectively. The S/H ratios of three mutants, BmPGAalpha144R, BmPGAbeta24F, and BmPGAbeta24F+alpha144R, were up to 1.3-3.0 times higher values. Compared to the wild-type BmPGA, BmPGAbeta24F+alpha144R showed superior potential of the synthetic performance, allowing the accumulation of up to twofold more cephalexin at sig	2007	9	28	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Amino Acids; Bacillus megaterium; Cloning, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Penicillin Amidase	Wang	Jingang
17132166	10.1186/1475-2859-5-36	High yield recombinant penicillin G amidase production and export into the growth medium using Bacillus megaterium.	During the last years B. megaterium was continuously developed as production host for the secretion of proteins into the growth medium. Here, recombinant production and export of B. megaterium ATCC14945 penicillin G amidase (PGA) which is used in the reverse synthesis of beta-lactam antibiotics were systematically improved. For this purpose, the PGA leader peptide was replaced by the B. megaterium LipA counterpart. A production strain deficient in the extracellular protease NprM and in xylose utilization to prevent gene inducer deprivation was constructed and employed. A buffered mineral medium containing calcium ions and defined amino acid supplements for optimal PGA production was developed in microscale cultivations and scaled up to a 2 Liter bioreactor. Productivities of up to 40 mg PGA per L growth medium were reached. The combination of genetic and medium optimization led to an overall 7-fold improvement of PGA production and export in B. megaterium.

Fluxes of central carbon metabolism [glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), biomass formation] were determined for several Bacillus megaterium strains (DSM319, WH320, WH323, MS941) in C- and N-limited chemostat cultures by (13)C labelling experiments. The labelling patterns of proteinogenic amino acids were analysed by GC/MS and therefrom flux ratios at important nodes within the metabolic network could be calculated. On the basis of a stoichiometric metabolic model flux distributions were estimated for the different B. megaterium strains used at various cultivation conditions. Generally all strains exhibited similar metabolic flux distributions, however, several significant changes were found in (1) the glucose flux entering the PPP via the oxidative branch, (2) the reversibilities within the PPP, (3) the relative fluxes of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA fed to the TCA cycle, (4) the fluxes around the pyruvate node involving a futile cycle.	2007	4	3	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering	Bacillus megaterium; Carbon Isotopes; Citric Acid Cycle; Kinetics; Models, Theoretical; Pentose Phosphate Pathway; Species Specificity; Substrate Specificity	F..rch	Tobias

The studies on transport of particles across porous systems are based on the Colloid Filtration Theory (CFT). According to CFT, the collision efficiency is constant along the system length [J.N. Ryan, M. Elimelech, Colloids Surf. A: Physicochem. Eng. Aspects 107 (1996) 1-56]. Decreasing values of collision efficiency have been reported, a phenomenon that has been interpreted as a deviation from the CFT [X. Li, T.D. Scheibe, W.P. Johnson, Environ. Sci.

17073788	10.1042/BST0341215	Function and engineering of the 15beta-hydroxylase CYP106A2.	CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 is a bacterial cytochrome P450 that is capable of transforming steroid hormones. It can be easily expressed in Escherichia coli with a high yield. Its activity in vitro can be achieved by using the adrenal redox proteins adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. So far, it was not possible to crystallize CYP106A2 because of degradation during the crystallization process. Nevertheless, CYP106A2 is an interesting enzyme for biotechnological use. It hydroxylates pharmaceutically important steroids such as progesterone and 11-deoxycortisol. However, it will be necessary for efficient application of CYP106A2 in biotechnology to improve the hydroxylation activity and manipulate the regiospecificity. The present paper gives an overview of recent developments in protein engineering of CYP106A2.	2007	2	13	Biochem Soc Trans	Biochemical Society transactions	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Crystallization; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Enzyme Stability; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Engineering; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation	Virus	C
17066287	10.1007/s00216-006-0829-z	Investigating the heterogeneity of cell growth in microbial colonies by FTIR microspectroscopy.	Microorganisms rarely occur as individual cells in nature and are, instead, organized in complex multicellular communities such as colonies, fruiting bodies, or biofilms. Interest in the natural microbial life-style has increased during the last decade and a whole plethora of techniques has been used to gain insight into the development, structure and composition of diverse microbial communities. We have developed a technique for investigating the spatial heterogeneity of microbial growth in macro-colonies which essentially entails excision of the colonies with the underlying agar, freezing and subsequent cryotoming of the colonies, then FTIR microspectroscopic mapping of the cryosections. Colonies from Legionella, Bacillus, and Candida strains were chosen as model systems of multi-cellular communities to evaluate the technique. The results obtained indicate pronounced cell population heterogeneity even in relatively young colonies cultivated under laboratory conditions.

A Gram-positive poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB)-degrading bacterial strain was isolated from compost. This organism, identified as Bacillus megaterium N-18-25-9, produced a clearing zone on opaque NB-PHB agar, indicating the presence of extracellular PHB depolymerase. A PHB depolymerase gene, PhaZ(Bm), of B. megaterium N-18-25-9 was cloned and sequenced, and the recombinant gene product was purified from Escherichia coli. The N-terminal half region of PhaZ(Bm) shared significant homologies with a catalytic domain of other PHB depolymerases. Although the C-terminal half region of PhaZ(Bm) showed no significant similarity with those of other PHB depolymerases, that region was necessary for the PHB depolymerase activity. Therefore, this enzyme's domain structure is unique among extracellular PHB depolymerase domain structures. The addition of PHB to the medium led to a sixfold increase in PhaZ(Bm) mRNA, while the presence of glucose repressed PhaZ(Bm) expression.

17046713	10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.09.139	PGRP-SB1: an N-acetylmuramoyl L-alanine amidase with antibacterial activity.	The peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family is conserved from insects to mammals and is involved in immune regulation and bacterial clearance. They form at least three functional classes; receptors required for immune gene expression; amidases that degrade peptidoglycan and scavenge the tissues from immune-stimulating peptidoglycan; and as proteins with antibacterial activity. We here report that PGRP-SB1 is an N-acetylmuramoyl l-alanine amidase, which (in contrast to the previously described PGRP-amidases) shows antibacterial activity. PGRP-SB1 is highly active against peptidoglycans that have a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) residue in the cross-linking peptide, but lack activity to most lysine-containing peptidoglycans. The antibacterial activity is pronounced against Bacillus megaterium with an LD(50) of 1.5microg ml(-1). The bactericidal effect of PGRP-SB1 is dependent on its enzymatic activity, as the zinc co-factor is essential.

In this study we report the identity of the microflora growing on the tobacco leaf surface by employing culture-independent methods. We have amplified microbial 16S rDNA sequences directly from the leaf surface and used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to identify bacterial community on the tobacco leaves. Our culture-independent methods for the study of microbial community on tobacco leaves showed that microbial community structures on leaves of variety Zhongyan 100, NC89 and Zhongyan 101 were similar between 0 and 6 months aging, and between 9 and 12 months aging, while the similarity is low between 0 and 6, and between 9 and 12 months aging, respectively.

17023115	10.1016/j.bbagen.2006.08.018	Cytochrome P450--redox partner fusion enzymes.	The cytochromes P450 (P450s) are a broad class of heme b-containing mono-oxygenase enzymes. The vast majority of P450s catalyse reductive scission of molecular oxygen using electrons usually derived from coenzymes (NADH and NADPH) and delivered from redox partner proteins. Evolutionary advantages may be gained by fusion of one or more redox partners to the P450 enzyme in terms of e.g. catalytic efficiency. This route was taken by the well characterized flavocytochrome P450(BM3) system (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium, in which soluble P450 and cytochrome P450 reductase enzymes are covalently linked to produce a highly efficient electron transport system for oxygenation of fatty acids and related molecules. However, genome analysis and ongoing enzyme characterization has revealed that there are a number of other novel classes of P450-redox partner fusion enzymes distributed widely in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

High cell density cultivations were performed under identical conditions for two Bacillus megaterium strains (MS941 and WH320), both carrying a heterologous dextransucrase (dsrS) gene under the control of the xylA promoter. At characteristic points of the cultivations (end of batch, initial feeding, before and after induction) the proteome was analyzed based on two dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric protein identification using the protein database "bmegMEC.v2" recently made available. High expression but no secretion of DsrS was found for the chemical mutant WH320 whereas for MS 941, a defined protease deficient mutant of the same parent strain (DSM319), not even expression of DsrS could be detected.

Recently we have developed a new approach to study protein-protein interactions using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy in combination with titration experiments and principal component analysis (FTIR-TPCA). In the present paper we review the FTIR-TPCA results obtained for the interaction between cytochrome P450 and the redox partner protein in two P450 systems, the Pseudomonas putida P450cam (CYP101) with putidaredoxin (P450cam-Pdx), and the Bacillus megaterium P450BM-3 (CYP102) heme domain with the FMN domain (P450BMP-FMND). Both P450 systems reveal similarities in the structural changes that occur upon redox partner complex formation. These involve an increase in beta-sheets and alpha-helix content, a decrease in the population of random coil/3(10)-helix structure, a redistribution of turn structures within the interacting proteins and changes in the protonation states or hydrogen-bonding of amino acid carboxylic side chains.

The isolation of cellulosomes from clostridial sources has been extensively studied; however, the isolation of cellulosomes from facultative soil anaerobes of the family Bacillaceae is not as well characterized. The Bacillus cellulosome (celluloxylanosome) essentially consists of two complex components: C-I and C-II. This multi-component complex enables Bacillus to degrade a variety of carbonaceous compounds as it is composed of several enzymes, such as cellulases, xylanases and other degradative enzymes. The cellulosomal cellulases from Bacillus megaterium were purified using cellulose affinity chromatography, followed by Sepharose 4B gel filtration chromatography. The objective of this investigation was to establish the effect of sulfate and sulfide on cellulosomal 'cellulase' activity.

More recently, there have been reports that HMGB1 may also function as a pro-inflammatory and antibacterial factor. The aim of this study was to investigate the testicular expression and antibacterial functions of HMGB1 to elucidate a possible role of HMGB1 in the testicular barrier defence against infections. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed high-level testicular expression of HMGB1 mRNA and localization of this expression to the Sertoli cells and germ cells of the human and rat testis. In addition, immunohistochemical examination demonstrated the presence of the corresponding protein in Sertoli cells and spermatogonia in human and rat testes.

However, no stable multicopy plasmids are currently available for long-term culture of K. marxianus. To allow the stable genetic/metabolic engineering of K. marxianus, a method for integrating precise numbers of the same or different genes was developed for this yeast. A K. marxianus URA3 deletion mutant was constructed and the URA3 blaster (UB) reusable selection cassette from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used to select sequential, untargeted chromosomal insertions of the Bacillus megaterium lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) gene.

Two glucose dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.47) genes, gdh223 and gdh151, were cloned from Bacillus megaterium AS1.223 and AS1.151, and were inserted into pQE30 to construct the expression vectors, pQE30-gdh223 and pQE30-gdh151, respectively. The transformant Escherichia coli M15 with pQE30-gdh223 gave a much higher glucose dehydrogenase activity than that with the plasmid pQE30-gdh151. Thus it was used to optimize the expression of glucose dehydrogenase. An proximately tenfold increase in GDH activity was achieved by the optimization of culture and induction conditions, and the highest productivity of glucose dehydrogenase (58.7 U/ml) was attained. The recombinant glucose dehydrogenase produced by E. coli M15 (pQE30-gdh223) was then used to regenerate NADPH.

A 2.2-kb fragment containing a replicon from pBtoxis, the large plasmid that encodes the insecticidal endotoxins of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis, was identified, cloned, and sequenced. This fragment contains cis elements, including iterons, found in replication origins of other large plasmids and suggests that pBtoxis replicates by a type A theta mechanism.

The deduced amino acid sequences of the 54.4-kDa and 11.8-kDa proteins showed no substantial homology with known replication (Rep) proteins. However, the 54.4-kDa protein contained a conserved FtsZ domain, and the 11.8 kDa protein contained a helix-turn-helix motif.

Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium is an extensively studied enzyme for industrial applications. A major focus of current protein engineering research is directed to improving the catalytic performance of P450 BM-3 toward nonnatural substrates of industrial importance in the presence of organic solvents or cosolvents. For the latter reason, it is important to study the effect of organic cosolvent molecules on the structure and dynamics of the enzyme, in particular, the effect of cosolvent molecules on the active site's structure and dynamics. In this paper, we have studied, using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the F87A mutant of P450 BM-3 in the presence of DMSO as cosolvent, to understand the role of the F87A substitution for its catalytic activity.

The membrane-bound human cytochrome P450s have essential roles in the metabolism of endogenous compounds and drugs. Presented here are the results on the construction and characterization of three fusion proteins containing the N-terminally modified human cytochrome P450s CYP2C9, CY2C19 and CYP3A4 fused to the soluble NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. The constructs, CYP2C9/BMR, CYP2C19/BMR and CYP3A4/BMR are well expressed in Escherichia coli as holo proteins.

16832724	10.1007/s00284-006-0051-4	Production of cellulase-free xylanase from Bacillus megaterium by solid state fermentation for biobleaching of pulp.	Xylanase production from B. megaterium was enhanced using solid state fermentation with respect to the use of solid substrate, moistening solution, moisture content, inoculum, sugars, soyabean meal, amino acids, and extraction with surfactant. An increase of approximately 423-fold in xylanase production and complete suppression of CMCase production was achieved over submerged liquid fermentation. Biobleaching using this cellulase-free xylanase, 8 U/g of oven dried pulp of 10% consistency, showed 8.12% and 1.16% increase in brightness and viscosity, 13.67% decrease in kappa number, and 31% decrease in chlorine consumption at the CD stage.	2006	8	22	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Bacillus megaterium; Cellulase; Cellulases; Fermentation; Industrial Microbiology; Paper; Xylosidases	Sindhu	Indu
16820240	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2006.05.005	Proteomic characterization of transient expression and secretion of a stress-related metalloprotease in high cell density culture of Bacillus megaterium.	Intracellular and extracellular proteome analysis was carried out by combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis (2DE/MS) for high cell density fed-batch culture of recombinant Bacillus megaterium strains. In the early feeding phase with a constant growth rate of 0.12h(-1) under glucose limitation, high expression and secretion of a metalloprotease (referred as Bmg1465) was detected. The transient appearance of this metalloprotease was found both as cell-associated and as secreted into the culture medium. Searching homologous proteins for functional assignment led to an unambiguous identification of Bmg1465 as a zinc-binding metalloprotease of the type immune inhibitor A (InhA). Metalloproteases of this type are currently considered as typical virulence factors associated with pathogenic Bacillus species. The result raises questions concerning the intrinsic function(s) of Bmg1465 in B. megaterium, which has the GRAS status, with respect to its stress re	2006	12	21	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Culture Techniques; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Metalloproteases; Oxidative Stress; Proteome; Proteomics	Wang	Wei
16791589	10.1007/s00253-006-0465-8	Overview of bacterial expression systems for heterologous protein production: from molecular and biochemical fundamentals to commercial systems.	During the proteomics period, the growth in the use of recombinant proteins has increased greatly in the recent years. Bacterial systems remain most attractive due to low cost, high productivity, and rapid use. However, the rational choice of the adequate promoter system and host for a specific protein of interest remains difficult. This review gives an overview of the most commonly used systems: As hosts, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Caulobacter crescentus, other strains, and, most importantly, Escherichia coli BL21 and E. coli K12 and their derivatives are presented. On the promoter side, the main features of the l-arabinose inducible araBAD promoter (PBAD), the lac promoter, the l-rhamnose inducible rhaP BAD promoter, the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, the trc and tac promoter, the lambda phage promoter p L , and the anhydrotetracycline-inducible tetA promoter/operator are summarized.	2006	11	28	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus; Bacteria; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Species Specificity	Terpe	Kay

Oxidative N-demethylation was measured by incubation experiments using Bacillus megaterium isolated from topsoil as a biocatalyst for the N-demethylation of the N,N-dialkylarylamines N,N-dimethylaniline and N-ethyl-N-methylaniline. Formed formaldehyde, normally difficult to analyse in biological systems because of further metabolization, was successfully trapped and converted into thiazolidine by addition of cysteamine into the incubation media. Studies using N,N-di-(trideutero-methyl)-aniline and N-ethyl-N-(trideuteromethyl)-aniline as well as N,N-di-[methyl-(13)C]-aniline and N-ethyl-N-[methyl-(13)C]-aniline were performed to confirm that the N-demethylation proceeds via formaldehyde.	2006	12	12	J Microbiol Methods	Journal of microbiological methods	Aniline Compounds; Bacillus megaterium; Cysteamine; Formaldehyde; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Thiazolidines	Taupp	Marcus

The Rhizobia comprise one of the most important groups of beneficial bacteria, which form nodules on the roots (rarely on the stems) of leguminous plants. They live within the nodules and reduce atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia, which is further assimilated by plants into required nitrogenous compounds. The Rhizobia in return obtain nutrition from the plant. Rhizobia are free-living soil bacteria and have to compete with other microorganisms for the limited available iron in the rhizosphere. In order to acquire iron Rhizobia have been shown to express siderophore-mediated iron transport systems. Rhizobium leguminosarum IARI 917 was investigated for its ability to produce siderophore. It was found to produce a dihydroxamate type siderophore under iron restricted conditions. The siderophore was purified and chemically characterized. The ESMS, MS/MS and NMR analysis indicate the dihydroxamate siderophore to be 'schizokinen', a siderophore reported to be produced by Bacillus megaterium that	2007	2	26	Biometals	Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine	Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Hydroxamic Acids; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Receptors, Cell Surface; Rhizobium leguminosarum; Siderophores; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Storey	E P

Insects defend themselves against foreign invaders via both a cellular response and a humoral response. The objective of this study was to identify proteins which were differently regulated in the immunized Bombyx mori larvae. Heat-inactivated bacteria (Bacillus megaterium) were injected into B. mori larvae, 4 days after final ecdysis. After 6 h, we identified the immune proteins in the hemolymph which had been differentially regulated in the immune-challenged larvae, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-D PAGE) and quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS). After the bacterial injection, more than 30 spots determined to have been up-regulated, and 11 spots were down-regulated. The heat shock 70 kDa protein cognate was one of the up-regulated hemocytic proteins, and peptidoglycan recognition protein, antichymotrypsin precursor, and gloverin-like protein 1 approximately 4 were newly synthesized in the plasma.

Bacillus megaterium DE BARY TRS-4 was isolated from tea rhizosphere and tested for its ability to promote growth and cause disease reduction in tea plants. In vivo studies revealed the ability of this bacterium to promote growth of tea plants very significantly. Brown root rot disease, caused by Fomes lamaoensis was markedly reduced by application of the bacterium to the soil. Population of F. lamaoensis in soil before and after application of B. megaterium, as determined by ELISA and dot-blot using PAb raised against the pathogen, was shown to be greatly reduced in presence of the bacterium. Biochemical changes induced in tea plants were also examined. Root colonization by B. megaterium and subsequent inoculation with F. lamaoensis also led to an increase in polyphenolics, as well as in defense related enzymes-peroxidase, chitinase, beta -1,3-glucanase and phenyl alanine ammonia lyase.

16697093	10.1016/j.envpol.2006.02.022	Influence of bacteria on Pb and Zn speciation, mobility and bioavailability in soil: A laboratory study.	A soil column experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of inoculation of bacteria on metal bioavailability, mobility and potential leachability through single chemical extraction, consequential extraction and in situ soil solution extraction technologies. Results showed that bacteria inoculated, including Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus mucilaginosus, may pose both positive and negative impacts on bioavailability and mobility of heavy metals in soil, depending on the chemical nature of the metals. The activities of bacteria led to an increase of water dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and a decrease of pH value, which enhanced metal mobility and bioavailability (e.g. an increase of water-soluble and HOAc-soluble Zn). On the other hand, bacteria could immobilize metals (e.g. a great reduction of water-soluble Pb) due to the adsorption by bacterial cell walls and possible sedimentation reactions with phosphate or other anions produced thr	2006	12	7	Environ Pollut	Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	Adsorption; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Chemical Fractionation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Industrial Waste; Lead; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Solubility; Zinc	Wu	S C

16604419	10.1007/s00284-005-0241-5	Diverse UV-B resistance of culturable bacterial community from high-altitude wetland water.	Isolation of most ultraviolet B (UV-B)-resistant culturable bacteria that occur in the habitat of Laguna Azul, a high-altitude wetland [4554 m above sea level (asl)] from the Northwestern Argentinean Andes, was carried out by culture-based methods. Water from this environment was exposed to UV-B radiation under laboratory conditions during 36 h, at an irradiance of 4.94 W/m2. It was found that the total number of bacteria in water samples decreased; however, most of the community survived long-term irradiation (312 nm) (53.3 kJ/m2). The percentage of bacteria belonging to dominant species did not vary significantly, depending on the number of UV irradiation doses. The most resistant microbes in the culturable community were Gram-positive pigmented species (Bacillus megaterium [endospores and/or vegetative cells], Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Nocardia sp.). Only one Gram-negative bacterium could be cultivated (Acinetobacter johnsonii).

Initial clinical presentation suggested an infectious etiology, which led to therapeutic elevation of the LASIK flap and further microbiologic investigation with bacterial cultures. Bacterial cultures revealed Bacillus megaterium, which was sensitive to all antibiotics against which it was tested. Twenty-four hours after initiating aggressive topical and oral antibiotic therapy, symptomatic relief occurred in the affected eye. The patient's uncorrected final visual acuity at 1-year follow-up was 20/15 in the right eye, and the stromal bed developed a faint peripheral non-visually significant scar.

As part of an ongoing effort to catalog spore-forming bacterial populations in environments conducive to interplanetary transfer by natural impacts or by human spaceflight activities, spores of Bacillus spp. were isolated and characterized from the interior of near-subsurface granite rock collected from the Santa Catalina Mountains, AZ. Granite was found to contain approximately 500 cultivable Bacillus spores and approximately 10(4) total cultivable bacteria per gram. Many of the Bacillus isolates produced a previously unreported diffusible blue fluorescent compound. Two strains of eight tested exhibited increased spore UV resistance relative to a standard Bacillus subtilis UV biodosimetry strain.

Peptide mass fingerprint (PMF) matching is a high-throughput method used for protein spot identification in connection with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE). However, the success of PMF matching largely depends on whether the proteins to be identified exist in the database searched. Consequently, it is often necessary to apply other more sophisticated but also time-consuming technologies to generate sequence-tags for definitive protein identification. On the other hand, modern sequencing technologies are generating a large quantity of DNA sequences, first in unfinished form or with low genome coverage due to the time-consuming and thus limiting steps of finishing and annotation.

Highly branched fatty acids, the main components of the preen-gland waxes of the domestic goose and the Muscovy duck, and their derivatives are promising chiral precursors for the synthesis of macrolide antibiotics. The key step in the utilisation of these compounds is their regioselective hydroxylation, which cannot be achieved in a classical chemical approach.

A eukaryotic microalga, Chlorella sp. DT, was transformed with the Bacillus megaterium strain MB1 merA gene, encoding mercuric reductase (MerA), which mediates the reduction of Hg2+ to volatile elemental Hg0. The transformed Chlorella cells were selected first by hygromycin B and then by HgCl2. The existence of merA gene in the genomic DNA of transgenic strains was shown by polymerase chain reaction amplification, while the stable integration of merA into genomic DNA of transgenic strains was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The ability to remove Hg2+ in merA transgenic strains was higher than that in the wild type. The merA transgenic strains showed higher growth rate and photosynthetic activity than the wild type did in the presence of a toxic concentration of Hg2+. Cultured with Hg2+, the expression level of superoxide dismutase in transgenic strains was lower than that in the wild type, suggesting that the transgenic strains faced a lower level of oxidative stress.

The 15beta-hydroxylase (CYP106A2) from Bacillus megaterium, one of the few bacterial steroid hydroxylases, which has been isolated and characterized so far, catalyses the 15beta-hydroxylation of a variety of steroids. The enzyme can be supported in its activity with adrenodoxin (Adx) and adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) from bovine adrenals, supplying this enzyme with the reducing equivalents necessary for steroid hydroxylation activity. This three-component electron transfer chain was implemented in Escherichia coli by coexpression of the corresponding coding sequences from two plasmids, containing different selection markers and compatible origins of replication. The cDNAs of AdR and Adx on the first plasmid were separated by a ribosome binding sequence, with the reductase preceding the ferredoxin.

16381045	10.1002/cbic.200500266	Altering the regioselectivity of cytochrome P450 CYP102A3 of Bacillus subtilis by using a new versatile assay system.	A novel monooxygenase (CYP102A3) has been discovered within the Bacillus subtilis genome that reveals a similarity of 76 % to the well-known cytochrome P450 BM-3 of B. megaterium (CYP102A1). Both enzymes are natural fusion proteins consisting of a heme domain and a FAD/FMN-reductase domain. Because of their high turnover rates, these biocatalysts are of special interest for industrial applications, but show only limited regioselectivity. In this work, the regioselectivity of CYP102A3 was changed by directed evolution and protein design to hydroxylate substrates not only in different subterminal, but also to a high extent, in terminal carbon chain positions. To enable a high-throughput screening procedure, a very versatile assay was developed that is capable of discriminating between terminal and subterminal hydroxylation of carbon chains. A double mutant of CYP102A3 was obtained that produces 48 % octan-1-ol as the main product of the reaction.	2006	5	25	Chembiochem	Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology	Bacterial Proteins; Biological Assay; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Octanols; Protein Conformation; Substrate Specificity	Lentz	Oliver

Cytochrome P450 BM-3 from Bacillus megaterium was engineered for enantioselective epoxidation of simple terminal alkenes. Screening saturation mutagenesis libraries, in which mutations were introduced in the active site of an engineered P450, followed by recombination of beneficial mutations generated two P450 BM-3 variants that convert a range of terminal alkenes to either (R)- or (S)-epoxide (up to 83 % ee) with high catalytic turnovers (up to 1370) and high epoxidation selectivities (up to 95 %). A biocatalytic system using E. coli lysates containing P450 variants as the epoxidation catalysts and in vitro NADPH regeneration by the alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii generates each of the epoxide enantiomers, without additional cofactor.	2007	7	24	Chemistry	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	NA	Kubo	Takafumi

Testing the toxicities and biological activities of the human metabolites of drugs is important for development of safe and effective pharmaceuticals. Producing these metabolites using human cytochrome P450s is difficult, however, because the human enzymes are costly, poorly stable, and slow. We have used directed evolution to generate variants of P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium that function via the "peroxide shunt" pathway, using hydrogen peroxide in place of the reductase domain, oxygen and NADPH. Here, we report further evolution of the P450 BM3 heme domain peroxygenase to enhance production of the authentic human metabolites of propranolol by this biocatalytic route. This system offers a versatile, cost-effective, and scaleable route to the synthesis of drug metabolites.	2006	3	16	Biotechnol Bioeng	Biotechnology and bioengineering	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biotransformation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Genes, Bacterial; Heme; Humans; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Mutation; Propranolol; Protein Engineering	Otey	Christopher R

Water and sediment samples were collected for a period of three months. When tested against 20 antibiotics 22 MAR strains were isolated from the samples, which were found resistant to 5-13 antibiotics. They belong to 7 genera and 10 species. Gram-negative bacteria namely Neisseria mucosa, N. sicca, Branhamella catarrhalis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Citrobacterintermedius, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Enterobacter aerogenes were isolated. Gram-positive bacteria were of Bacillus subtilis, B. megaterium and Micrococcus luteus. When plasmid curing was done using acredine orange, the resistance against penicillin-G, ampicillin, tetracycline, amoxycillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol were totally lost in all strains, which confirmed the role of plasmid in these strains against antibiotics.

18093991	10.1093/protein/gzm074	Laboratory evolution of P450 BM3 for mediated electron transfer yielding an activity-improved and reductase-independent variant.	One of the main obstacles in employing P450 monooxygenases for preparative chemical syntheses in cell-free systems is their requirement for cofactors such as NAD(P)H. In order to engineer P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium for cost-effective process conditions in vitro, a validated medium throughput screening system based on cheap Zn dust as an electron source and Cobalt(III)sepulchrate (Co(III)sep) as a mediator was reported. In the current study, the alternative cofactor system Zn/Co(III)sep was used in a directed evolution experiment to improve the Co(III)sep-mediated electron transfer to P450 BM3. A variant, carrying five mutations (R47F F87A V281G M354S D363H, Table I), P450 BM3 M5 was identified and characterized with respect to its kinetic parameters. P450 BM3 M5 achieved for mediated electron transfer a 2-fold higher k(cat) value and a 3-fold higher catalytic efficiency compared with the starting point mutant P450 BM3 F87A (k(cat): 62 min(-1) compared with 28 min(-1); k(cat)/K(m	2008	4	23	Protein Eng Des Sel	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS	Bacterial Proteins; Cobalt; Coenzymes; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Electron Transport; Kinetics; Laurates; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Mutagenesis; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidoreductases; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Zinc	Nazor	Jovana

Transcription and mobilization facilities of a group II intron, B.me.I1, which was classified within a group IIB subclass and nested in a broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposon TnMERI1 found from the chromosome of Bacillus megaterium strain MB1 were investigated. Though B.me.I1 does not intervene in any recognizable exon gene, the splicing ability of B.me.I1 in Escherichia coli was confirmed by applying RT-PCR with RNA template transcribed by using a T7 RNA polymerase-promoter expression system. The homing activity of B.me.I1 was confirmed by using an intron-less allele fragment as a specific integration site which was cloned from Tn5084, a TnMERI1-family mercury resistance transposon. The transcription and splicing of B.me.I1 in the original host, the strain MB1, were also observed as its natural property.

Compared with Bacillius megaterium MS941 (pWXAK3) expressing ker gene with PxylA-PamyL promoters, B. megaterium MS941 (pWAK3) with PamyL displayed higher keratinase yield (168.6 U/ml) and specific activity (14.59 U/mg) after 36 h of growth in LB medium, however the keratinase yield decreased in the culture grown in LB medium supplemented with starch or xylose or both. A maximum yield of 186.3 U/ml with specific activity of 17.25 U/mg was obtained from xylose induced keratinase expression in B. megaterium MS941 (pWHK3) grown for 24h.

Escherichia coli BL21, expressing a quintuple mutant of P450(BM-3), oxyfunctionalizes alpha-pinene in an NADPH-dependent reaction to alpha-pinene oxide, verbenol, and myrtenol. We optimized the whole-cell biocatalyst by integrating a recombinant intracellular NADPH regeneration system through co-expression of a glucose facilitator from Zymomonas mobilis for uptake of unphosphorylated glucose and a NADP(+)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium that oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone. The engineered strain showed a nine times higher initial alpha-pinene oxide formation rate corresponding to a sixfold higher yield of 20 mg g(-1) cell dry weight after 1.5 h. The initial total product formation rate was 1,000 micromol h(-1) micromol(-1) P450 leading to a total of 32 mg oxidized products per gram cell of dry weight after 1.5 h.

In this study we evaluated the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium for the recombinant production of scFab and scFvs in comparison to E. coli. The lysozyme specific D1.3 scFab was produced in B. megaterium and E. coli. The total yield of the scFab after purification obtained from the periplasmic fraction and culture supernatant of E. coli was slightly higher than that obtained from culture supernatant of B. megaterium.

18020460	10.1021/bi701945j	Bacillus megaterium CYP102A1 oxidation of acyl homoserine lactones and acyl homoserines.	Quorum sensing, the ability of bacteria to sense their own population density through the synthesis and detection of small molecule signals, has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are a major class of quorum sensing signaling molecules. In nature, some bacteria that do not synthesize AHLs themselves have developed the ability to degrade these compounds by cleaving the amide bond or the lactone ring. By inactivating this signal used by competing bacteria, the degrading microbe is believed to gain a competitive advantage. In this work we report that CYP102A1, a widely studied cytochrome P450 from Bacillus megaterium, is capable of very efficient oxidation of AHLs and their lactonolysis products acyl homoserines. The previously known substrates for this enzyme, fatty acids, can also be formed in nature by hydrolysis of the amide of AHLs, so CYP102A1 is capable of inactivating the active parent compound and the products of both known pathway	2008	5	30	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Acyl-Butyrolactones; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Homoserine; Kinetics; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Molecular Structure; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Binding; Quorum Sensing	Chowdhary	Puneet K

Whole-cell sensing systems based on living genetically engineered bacteria are known to have high sensitivity, selectivity, and rapid response times. Although these systems have found applications in biomedical and environmental analyses, their limited shelf life and transportability still restrict their use for on-site monitoring of analytes. To that end, we have developed a new method for the long-term preservation, storage, and transport of whole-cell biosensing systems that is based on bacterial spores, a dormant form of life. Specifically, we have employed spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium for development of luminescent sensing systems for two model analytes, namely, arsenic and zinc. These sensing cells were converted to spores, which can then be "revived" (germinated) at a later time to generate viable and metabolically active cells.

17987854		Exploring the use of natural antimicrobial agents and pulsed electric fields to control spoilage bacteria during a beer production process.	Different natural antimicrobials affected viability of bacterial contaminants isolated at critical steps during a beer production process. In the presence of 1 mg/ml chitosan and 0.3 mg/ml hops, the viability of Escherichia coli in an all malt barley extract wort could be reduced to 0.7 and 0.1% respectively after 2 hour- incubation at 4 degrees C. The addition of 0.0002 mg/ml nisin, 0.1 mg/ml chitosan or 0.3 mg/ml hops, selectively inhibited growth of Pediococcus sp. in more than 10,000 times with respect to brewing yeast in a mixed culture. In the presence of 0.1 mg ml chitosan in beer, no viable cells of the thermoresistant strain Bacillus megaterium were detected. Nisin, chitosan and hops increased microbiological stability during storage of a local commercial beer inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum or Pediococcus sp. isolated from wort.

The available crystal structures of the enzyme show non-productive binding of substrates with their omega-end distant from the iron in a hydrophobic pocket at one side of the active site. We have constructed and characterised mutants in which this pocket is filled by large hydrophobic side-chains replacing alanine at position 82. The mutants having phenylalanine or tryptophan at this position have very much (approximately 800-fold) greater affinity for substrate, with a greater conversion of the haem iron to the high-spin state, and similarly increased catalytic efficiency. The enzyme as isolated contains bound palmitate, reflecting this much higher affinity.

Three of these non-rhizobial isolates called NR2, NR4 and NR6 showed plant growth promotion with respect to increase in plant fresh weight, chlorophyll content, nodule number and nodule fresh weight when co-inoculated with the rhizobial bioinoculant strain IC3123. The three isolates were neither able to nodulate C. cajan nor did they show significant plant growth promotion when inoculated alone without Rhizobium spp. IC3123. All the three isolates were gram positive rods with NR2 and NR4 showing endospore formation and formed one single cluster in Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA). Partial sequences of 16S rRNA genes of NR4 and NR6 showed 97% similarity to Bacillus megaterium.

17826861	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2007.08.004	Effect of different carbon sources on central metabolic fluxes and the recombinant production of a hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca in Bacillus megaterium.	The recombinant Bacillus megaterium strain WH323 was employed for the inducible production and secretion of recombinant Thermobifida fusca hydrolase (TFH). Continuous cultivations were carried out in a chemostat using either glucose or pyruvate as sole carbon source. A remarkable increase of produced TFH was detected for the pyruvate-dependent cultivation compared to glucose-dependent growth. Estimation of intracellular carbon fluxes through the central metabolism for both growth conditions using (13)C-labelled substrates revealed noticeable changes of the fluxes through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway and around the pyruvate node when protein production was induced. With pyruvate as sole carbon source the observed alterations of the fluxes yielded an increased production of ATP and NADPH both required for the anabolism. Additionally, the analysis of the corresponding secretome revealed significantly reduced amounts of extracellular proteases in the medium c	2008	1	15	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Actinomycetales; Bacillus megaterium; Bioreactors; Citric Acid Cycle; Energy Metabolism; Hydrolases; Pentose Phosphate Pathway; Pyruvic Acid; Recombinant Proteins	F..rch	Tobias
17805580	10.1007/s00449-007-0152-x	Online filtering of CO2 signals from a bioreactor gas outflow using a committee of constructive neural networks.	This work proposes a committee of Cascade Correlation neural networks as an online smoother for random measurement noise. The goals of this paper are twofold: first it intends to explore the possibilities of using a constructive neural network algorithm to learn how to filter typical noisy data from a bioreactor, CO(2) mol fractions of the effluent gas during the aerobic cultivation of Bacillus megaterium to produce the enzyme penicillin G acylase. Second, to propose a committee of such networks for achieving more realistic results, capturing the inherent trend of the process. In order to do that this paper discusses the advantages of using a constructive neural network algorithm, describes how the committee of NNs operates and evaluates its performance using real CO(2) online data obtained in laboratorial experiments. The paper also presents results obtained with classical filtering algorithms, for comparison.	2008	4	8	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering	Algorithms; Bacillus megaterium; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Flow Injection Analysis; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted	Giordano	Roberto C
17804215	10.1016/j.bios.2007.06.006	Holographic sensors for the detection of bacterial spores.	Holographic sensors for the detection of Bacillus species spore germination and vegetative growth are described. Reflection holograms were fabricated using a diffusion method for the distribution of ultra-fine silver bromide grains into pre-formed polymer films, followed by holographic recording using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG (532 nm) laser. Changes in holographic replay wavelength or diffraction intensity were used to characterise the swelling behaviour or structural integrity of a range of holographic matrices in response to various extracellular products of bacterial spore germination and vegetative metabolism. Divalent metal ion-sensitive holograms containing a methacrylated analogue of nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as the chelating monomer were successfully used to monitor Ca2+ ions released during B. subtilis spore germination in real-time, which was within minutes of sample addition; the holographic response manifested as a 16 nm blue-shift in diffraction wavelength over the pro	2008	2	26	Biosens Bioelectron	Biosensors &amp; bioelectronics	Acrylamide; Bacillus subtilis; Biosensing Techniques; Caseins; Endopeptidase K; Holography; Reproducibility of Results; Spores, Bacterial; Starch; alpha-Amylases	Bhatta	D

Interactions between a soluble form of microsomal cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) from Musca domestica (housefly) and Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 and its component reductase (CPR), heme (P450) and FAD/NADPH-binding (FAD) domains were analyzed by a combination of steady-state and stopped-flow kinetics methods, and optical spectroscopy techniques. The high affinity binding of b(5) to P450 BM3 induced a low-spin to high-spin transition in the P450 heme iron (K(d) for b(5) binding = 0.44 microM and 0.72 microM for the heme domain and intact flavocytochrome, respectively). The b(5) had modest inhibitory effects on steady-state turnover of P450 BM3 with fatty acids, and the ferrous-carbon monoxy P450 complex was substantially stabilized on binding b(5). Single turnover reduction of b(5) by BM3 using stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy (k(lim) = 116 s(-1)) was substantially faster than steady-state reduction of b(5) by P450 BM3 (or its CPR and FAD domains), indicating rate-limiting s	2007	10	17	Drug Metab Rev	Drug metabolism reviews	Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Cytochromes b5; Electron Transport; Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide; Flavins; Heme; Houseflies; Kinetics; Lauric Acids; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Conformation; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Substrate Specificity	Noble	Michael A
17763042	10.1080/03601230701555088	Behavior of fenhexamid in soil and water.	A study was conducted to investigate fenhexamid (FEX) behavior in soil and in water. FEX proved to be rather stable at acid pH but showed slight degradation at neutral and alkaline pH. After 101 days of FEX spiking of a soil sample, 94% at pH 4, 12% at pH 7 and 23% at pH 9 of the active ingredient was still present. In natural water the rate of FEX disappearance appeared to be slow which may be due to abiotic rather than biotic processes. The soil degradation tests showed low persistence of the active ingredient if a good microflora activity is guaranteed (DT(50) about 1 day). Moreover, in absence of microorganisms, FEX proved to be stable. Humidities of 25 and 50% of Water Holding Capacity (WHC) influenced in equal measure the rate of degradation. From the same soil, a bacterium was isolated and identified as Bacillus megaterium, which was able to metabolize FEX with the hydroxylation of the cyclohexane ring. Moreover, FEX showed an elevated affinity for humic acid (73%), smectite (31	2007	12	6	J Environ Sci Health B	Journal of environmental science and health. Part.

17706598	10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.07.155	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Clostridium acetobutylicum: a new alpha-fatty acid hydroxylase.	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from the anaerobic microorganism Clostridium acetobutylicum (CYP152A2) has been produced in Escherichia coli. CYP152A2 was shown to bind a broad range of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and corresponding methyl esters and demonstrated a high peroxygenase activity of up to 200min(-1) with myristic acid. Although a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide of 200microM was necessary for high activities of the enzyme, it led to a fast enzyme inactivation within 2-4min. This might reflect the natural function of CYP152A2 as a rapid hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme. In two different reconstituted systems with NADPH, CYP152A2 was able to convert 10 times more substrate, if provided with flavodoxin and flavodoxin reductase from E. coli and even 30-40 times more substrate with the CYP102A1-reductase from Bacillus megaterium. According to the clear preference for hydroxylation at alpha-position, CYP152A2 can be referred to as fatty acid alpha-hydroxylase.	2007	10	23	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Cloning, Molecular; Clostridium acetobutylicum; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Hydrogen Peroxide; Kinetics; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Models, Biological; Models, Chemical; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Binding; Substrate Specificity	Girhard	Marco

17680305	10.1007/s00284-007-9001-z	Bacterial degradation and corrosion of naphtha in transporting pipeline.	Five naphtha hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria including representative strains of the two classified species (Serratia marcescensAR1, Bacillus pumilusAR2, Bacillus carboniphilus AR3, Bacillus megaterium AR4, and Bacillus cereus AR5) were identified by 16S rDNA gene sequence in a naphtha-transporting pipeline. The naphtha-degrading strains were able to be involved in the corrosion process of API 5LX steel and also utilized the naphtha as the sole carbon source. The biodegradation of naphtha by the bacterial isolates was characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Weight-loss measurement on the corrosion of API 5LX steel in the presence/absence of consortia grown in naphtha-water aqueous media was performed. The scanning electron microscope observation showed that the consortia were able to attack the steel API 5LX surface, creating localized corrosion (pit). The biodegradation of naphtha by the strains AR1, AR2, AR3, AR4, and AR5 showed biodegradation efficiency of about 76.21,	2008	1	8	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Alkanes; Bacillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Corrosion; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Serratia; Steel	Rajasekar	A

17657486	10.1007/s00253-007-1089-3	Bacillus megaterium--from simple soil bacterium to industrial protein production host.	Bacillus megaterium has been industrially employed for more than 50 years, as it possesses some very useful and unusual enzymes and a high capacity for the production of exoenzymes. It is also a desirable cloning host for the production of intact proteins, as it does not possess external alkaline proteases and can stably maintain a variety of plasmid vectors. Genetic tools for this species include transducing phages and several hundred mutants covering the processes of biosynthesis, catabolism, division, sporulation, germination, antibiotic resistance, and recombination. The seven plasmids of B. megaterium strain QM B1551 contain several unusual metabolic genes that may be useful in bioremediation. Recently, several recombinant shuttle vectors carrying different strong inducible promoters and various combinations of affinity tags for simple protein purification have been constructed. Leader sequences-mediated export of affinity-tagged proteins into the growth medium was made possible. 	2007	11	27	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Genetic Engineering; Industrial Microbiology; Plasmids; Recombinant Proteins; Soil Microbiology	Vary	Patricia S

Testosterone hydroxylation was improved by a factor 16 by co-expressing Fer, a putative Fe-S protein from Bacillus subtilis. In addition, the specificity for 15beta-hydroxylation was improved by mutating threonine residue 248 of CYP106A2 into valine. These new insights provide the basis for an optimized whole-cell steroid-hydroxylating biocatalyst that can be applied with an organic solvent phase.	2007	12	3	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Hydroxylation; Models, Biological; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Pseudomonas putida; Solvents; Substrate Specificity; Testosterone	Ruijssenaars	Harald J

An in vivo system was developed for the biotransformation of D-fructose into D-mannitol by the expression of the gene mdh encoding mannitol dehydrogenase (MDH) from Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides ATCC12291 in Bacillus megaterium. The NADH reduction equivalents necessary for MDH activity were regenerated via the oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide by coexpression of the gene fdh encoding Mycobacterium vaccae N10 formate dehydrogenase (FDH). High-level protein production of MDH in B. megaterium required the adaptation of the corresponding ribosome binding site. The fdh gene was adapted to B. megaterium codon usage via complete chemical gene synthesis. Recombinant B. megaterium produced up to 10.60 g/L D-mannitol at the shaking flask scale. Whole cell biotransformation in a fed-batch bioreactor increased D-mannitol concentration to 22.00 g/L at a specific productivity of 0.32 g D-mannitol (gram cell dry weight)(-1) h(-1) and a D-mannitol yield of 0.91 mol/mol.

Penicillin G acylase (PGA) is one of the most important enzymes for the pharmaceutical industry. Bacillus megaterium has the advantage of producing extra-cellular PGA. This work compares two neural networks (NNs) architectures for on-line inference of B. megaterium cell mass in an aerated stirred tank bioreactor, during the production of PGA. Nowadays, intelligent computing tools such as artificial NNs and fuzzy logic are commonly applied for state inference and modeling of bioreactors. Combining these two approaches in hybrid, neuro-fuzzy systems, may be advantageous. Our results indicate that a neuro-fuzzy inference system showed a better performance to infer cell concentrations, when compared to multilayer perceptrons networks.	2008	1	8	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering	Bacillus megaterium; Bioreactors; Colony Count, Microbial; Fuzzy Logic; Models, Biological; Neural Networks, Computer; Online Systems; Penicillin Amidase; Systems Biology	Nucci	Edson R

In order to test for the contribution of specific amino acid residues to levansucrase catalysis, the wild-type enzyme along with 16 variants based on sequence alignments and structural information were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli. The purified enzymes were characterized kinetically and the product spectrum of each variant was determined. Comparison of the X-ray structures of the levansucrases from Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Gram-negative Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus in conjunction with the corresponding product spectra identified crucial amino acid residues responsible for product specificity and catalysis.

In presented study the capability of microorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere of sweet flag (Acorus calamus) to the atrazine degradation was assessed. Following isolation of the microorganisms counts of psychrophilic bacteria, mesophilic bacteria and fungi were determined. Isolated microorganisms were screened in terms of their ability to decompose a triazine herbicide, atrazine.

Overexpression of a mercuric ion binding protein, MerP, from the mercury resistance operon genes of Gram-positive bacterial strain Bacillus megaterium MB1 and from Gram-negative bacterial strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa K-62 was found to enhance the mercury resistance level of Escherichia coli host cells, even though they share only 27.3% identity. Immunoblot analysis showed that MerP (BMerP) from Bacillus could be expressed on the membrane fraction of E. coli cells. Treated with 10 microM Hg2+, a recombinant strain harboring the BMerP gene significantly improved, showing a 27% increase in mercuric ion adsorption capacity, 16% better than that of a Pseudomonas merP gene (PMerP)-harboring strain. While multiple heavy metals co-existed, the mercuric ion adsorption capacity of the BMerP-harboring E. coli was not affected while that of the PMerP-harboring strain decreased.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus megaterium bacteria were frozen at -15 degrees C using a freezer and a spray freezing method. The frozen Bacillus spores were also exposed to UV and free chlorine. An average of 4.7-log inactivation was obtained from the spray ice with 2-day storage time, while the freezer freezing only caused 0.84-log reduction with the same storage time. Significantly higher inactivation levels were observed for the E. coli cells with 2-day storage compared with those without storage. The spray freezing was found more effective in killing the E. coli cells, while more cells were sublethally injured by the freezer freezing. Freezing did not kill the Bacillus megaterium spores, but affected their response to UV and chlorine. Greater inactivation levels were observed at higher free chlorine doses or longer contact time, and the UV fluence-response curve showed initial rapid kill followed by tailing for the frozen spores.	2007	8	2	Water Environ Res	Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation	Bacillus megaterium; Chlorine; Colony Count, Microbial; Disinfection; Drug Resistance; Escherichia coli; Freezing; Microbial Viability; Models, Biological; Ultraviolet Rays	Gao	W

The use of cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) enzymes as biocatalysts for the production of fine chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, has been of increasing interest, primarily owing to their catalytic diversity and broad substrate range. CYP102A1 (P450 BM3) from Bacillus megaterium integrates an entire monooxygenase system into one polypeptide and represents an appropriate prokaryotic model for industrial applications of mammalian P450 activities. CYP102A1 not only exhibits the highest catalytic activity ever detected in a P450 monooxygenase but also provides a potentially versatile biocatalyst for the production of human P450 metabolites. CYP102A1 can be further engineered to be a drug-metabolizing enzyme, making it a promising candidate to use as a biocatalyst in drug discovery and synthesis.	2007	9	26	Trends Biotechnol	Trends in biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Catalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Pharmaceutical Preparations	Yun	Chul-Ho

This protein organization is responsible for the extraordinary catalytic activities making both monooxygenases promising enzymes for biocatalysis. CYP102A1 and CYP102A3 are fatty acid hydroxylases that share 65% identity, and their mutants are able to oxidize a wide range of substrates. In an attempt to increase the process stability of CYP102A1, we exchanged the more unstable reductase domain of CYP102A1 with the more stable reductase domain of CYP102A3. Stability of the chimeric fusion protein was determined spectrophotometrically as well as by measuring the hydroxylation activity towards 12-para-nitrophenoxydodecanoic acid (12-pNCA) after incubation at elevated temperatures. In the reaction with 12-pNCA, the new chimeric protein exhibited 88 and 38% of the activity of CYP102A3 and CYP102A1, respecti	2007	9	18	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Enzyme Stability; Hot Temperature; Mixed Function Oxygenases; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Recombinant Fusion Proteins	Eiben	Sabine
17465554	10.1021/ja071355m	Laser photoexcitation of NAD(P)H induces reduction of P450 BM3 heme domain on the microsecond time scale.	We demonstrate that photoexcitation of NAD(P)H at 355 nm using a Nd:YAG laser leads to rapid reduction of the heme domain of the Bacillus megaterium fatty acid hydroxylase flavocytochrome P450 BM3. An aqueous electron derived from photoexcited NAD(P)H is rapidly transferred to the heme domain, enabling the formation of a carbon monoxy complex of the ferrous P450 (FeII-CO) on the microsecond time scale. Using this approach we have determined the limiting rate constant (1770 s-1 for substrate-free heme domain) for formation of the FeII-CO complex. We find no dependence of the observed rate of FeII-CO complex formation on NAD(P)H concentration but demonstrate a hyperbolic dependence on carbon monoxide concentration. The apparent dissociation constant for the complex of carbon monoxide bound noncovalently to the ferric form of the BM3 heme domain (and with NADH as reductant) is 323 microM. Binding of a P450 substrate (N-palmitoylglycine) weakened the complex between carbon monoxide and the	2007	9	10	J Am Chem Soc	Journal of the American Chemical Society	Alanine; Carbon Monoxide; Coenzymes; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Heme; Iron; Kinetics; Lasers; Mutation; NAD; Oxidation-Reduction; Photochemistry; Protein Binding; Spectrophotometry; Substrate Specificity; Time Factors	Girvan	Hazel M

17462887	10.1016/j.biortech.2007.03.002	Controversial role of fungal laccases in decreasing the antibacterial effect of olive mill waste-waters.	Antibacterial diffusion tests (against Bacillus megaterium) detected both bacterial growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting components in olive mill waste-water (OMW). Mixtures of OMW aromatic components showed antibacterial effects that did not show antibacterial activity when tested as individual compounds. Strains of white rot fungi (WRF) producing different patterns of lignin modifying enzymes (LMEs) have been evaluated for OMW remediation under nutritional conditions affecting the LMEs produced. The decrease of both the content in OMW phenols and in the OMW antibacterial activity was compared with fungal growth and LMEs production. OMW addition to the cultures increased fungal growth and laccase activity irrespectively of the nutritional conditions of the cultures. Laccase was the sole LME activity that increased after OMW addition to the cultures. Neither the increased growth of WRF in OMW-containing cultures, their content in laccase nor the amount of OMW phenols were direct indi	2008	4	8	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacillus megaterium; Fungi; Industrial Waste; Laccase; Olea; Waste Disposal, Fluid	de la Rubia	T

The aim of this study was to investigate environmental conditions affecting chicken feather degradation and keratinolytic enzyme production by Bacillus megaterium F7-1, a feather-degrading mesophilic bacterium. B. megaterium F7-1 degraded whole chicken feather completely within 7 days. The bacterium grew with an optimum at pH 7.0-11.0 and 25-40 degrees C, where maximum keratinolytic activity was also observed. The production of keratinolytic enzyme by B. megaterium F7-1 was inducible with feather. Keratinolytic enzyme production by B. megaterium F7-1 at 0.6% (w/v) skim milk was 468U/ml, which was about 9.4-fold higher than that without skim milk. The amount of keratinolytic enzyme production depended on feather concentrations. The degradation rate of autoclaved chicken feathers by cell-free culture supernatant was 26% after 24h of incubation, but the degradation of untreated chicken feathers was unsuccessful.

17434971	10.1128/JB.00110-07	Role of chromosomal and plasmid-borne receptor homologues in the response of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spores to germinants.	Spores of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 germinate in response to a number of trigger compounds, including glucose, proline, leucine, and inorganic salts. An approximate 6-kb region of the 165-kb plasmid was found to harbor a tricistronic receptor operon, gerU, and a monocistronic receptor component, gerVB. The gerU operon was observed to complement the germination response in plasmidless strain PV361 to glucose and leucine, with KBr acting as a cogerminant. Proline recognition is conferred by the monocistronic gerVB gene, the presence of which also improves the germination response to other single-trigger compounds. A chimeric receptor, GerU*, demonstrates interchangeability between receptor components and provides evidence that it is the B protein of the receptor that determines germinant specificity. Introduction of the gerU/gerVB gene cluster to B. megaterium KM extends the range of germinants recognized by this strain to include glucose, proline, and KBr in addition to alanine and l	2007	7	31	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biological Transport; Bromides; Chromosomes, Bacterial; DNA, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Complementation Test; Glucose; Leucine; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Operon; Plasmids; Potassium Compounds; Proline; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Deletion; Spores, Bacterial; Transformation, Bacterial	Christie	Graham

A lack of effective, easily applied and stable formulation has been a major obstacle to widespread use of biocontrol agents for control of rice sheath blight. In this study, effervescent fast-disintegrating granules containing endospores of Bacillus megaterium were developed for use either by broadcast or spray application. The formulation composed of lactose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone K-30 (PVP, K-30) and effervescent base (citric acid, tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate). The number of living bacteria in effervescent granules that performed mycelial growth inhibition was in the range of 10(9) CFU/g after 12 months storage at room temperature. The number of viable bacteria after applying into the water and spraying on the rice seedling for 7 days in the greenhouse tests were also satisfactory high (10(9) CFU/g of granules and 10(6) CFU/g of plant, respectively).

Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) produced throughout our body are important effectors in the defense barrier of innate immunity. Here, we have analyzed antimicrobial activity and polypeptide composition of meconium versus neonatal feces to address the development of antimicrobial defense of the neonatal gut. Extracts of meconium exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, and group B streptococci (GBS) but not against the yeast Candida albicans. Extracts of neonatal feces were found to possess low activity against E. coli, GBS, and C. albicans. However, the anti-B. megaterium activity was higher in the fecal extracts than in meconium. All activities were reduced or abolished when salt was added to the antimicrobial assay. The AMP cathelicidin LL-37, alpha-defensin HNP-1-2, alpha-defensin HD 5, and lysozyme were identified in both meconium and fecal extracts.

17410875		[Reaction of microorganisms to the digestive fluid of the earthworms].	The reaction of soil bacteria and fungi to the digestive fluid of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa was studied. The fluid was obtained by centrifugation of the native enzymes of the digestive tract. The inhibition of growth of certain bacteria, spores, and fungal hyphae under the effect of extracts from the anterior and middle sections of the digestive tract of A. caliginosa was discovered for the first time. In bacteria, microcolony formation was inhibited as early as 20-30 s after the application of the gut extracts, which may indicate the nonenzymatic nature of the effect. The digestive fluid exhibited the same microbicidal activity whether the earthworms were feeding on soil or sterile sand. This indicates that the microbicidal agents are formed within the earthworm's body, rather than by soil microorganisms. The effect of the digestive fluid from the anterior and middle divisions is selective in relation to different microorganisms.

Crystal structure determination of catabolite control protein A (CcpA) at 2.6 A resolution reveals for the first time the structure of a full-length apo-form LacI-GalR family repressor protein. In the crystal structures of these transcription regulators, the three-helix bundle of the DNA-binding domain has only been observed in cognate DNA complexes; it has not been observed in other crystal structures owing to its mobility. In the crystal packing of apo-CcpA, the protein-protein contacts between the N-terminal three-helix bundle and the core domain consisted of interactions between the homodimers that were similar to those between the corepressor protein HPr and the CcpA N-subdomain in the ternary DNA complex. In contrast to the DNA complex, the apo-CcpA structure reveals large subdomain movements in the core, resulting in a complete loss of contacts between the N-subdomains of the homodimer.	2007	5	31	Acta Crystallogr Sect F Struct Biol Cryst Commun	Acta crystallographica.

This work characterizes a recently discovered natural tetracycline-resistance plasmid called pMA67 from Paenibacillus larvae--a Gram-positive bacterial pathogen of honey bees. We provide evidence that pMA67 replicates by the rolling-circle mechanism, and sequence comparisons place it in the pMV158 family of rolling-circle replicons. The plasmid contains predicted rep, cop, and rnaII genes for control of replication initiating at a predicted double-strand origin. The plasmid has an ssoT single-strand origin, which is efficient enough to allow only very small amounts of the single-stranded DNA intermediate to accumulate. The overall efficiency of replication is sufficient to render the plasmid segregationally stable without selection in P. larvae and in Bacillus megaterium, but not in Escherichia coli. The plasmid is expected to be mobilizable due to the presence of a mob gene and an oriT site. The plasmid contains a tetL gene, whose predicted amino acid sequence implies a relatively anc	2007	12	6	Plasmid	Plasmid	Animals; Bacillus; Base Sequence; Bees; Conserved Sequence; DNA Replication; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Circular; Genes, Bacterial; Larva; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Replicon; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Tetracycline Resistance	Murray	K Daniel

A fed-batch process utilizing a pET-based expression system (pET28a+ derivative) and E. coli BL21(DE3) as production strain for the heterologous expression of recombinant cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium was developed. In a first step the expression was optimized during a series of flask experiments testing several parameters for their influence on the expression level, activity and solubility of the recombinant protein. The optimal process parameters found in the flask experiments were transferred to a cultivation process in a 5l (operating volume) bioreactor with a special focus on the feeding strategy and the aeration during expression. Glycerol feeding proved to be superior over glucose as carbon source since the formation of larger amounts of acetate was prevented. Expression levels exceeding 12,500nmoll(-1), corresponding to approximately 1.5gl(-1) of product in culture medium ( approximately 11% of CDW) could be demonstrated.

17313171	10.1094/MPMI-20-2-0207	Bacillus megaterium rhizobacteria promote growth and alter root-system architecture through an auxin- and ethylene-independent signaling mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana.	Soil microorganisms are critical players in plant-soil interactions at the rhizosphere. We have identified a Bacillus megaterium strain that promoted growth and development of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants. We used Arabidopsis thaliana as a model to characterize the effects of inoculation with B. megaterium on plant-growth promotion and postembryonic root development. B. megaterium inoculation caused an inhibition in primary-root growth followed by an increase in lateral-root number, lateral-root growth, and root-hair length. Detailed cellular analyses revealed that primary root-growth inhibition was caused both by a reduction in cell elongation and by reduction of cell proliferation in the root meristem. To study the contribution of auxin and ethylene signaling pathways in the alterations in root-system architecture elicited by B. megaterium, a suite of plant hormone mutants of Arabidopsis, including aux1-7, axr4-1, eir1, etr1, ein2, and rhd6, defective in 	2007	6	26	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI	Arabidopsis; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Indoleacetic Acids; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Plant Roots; Rhizobium; Signal Transduction	L..pez-Bucio	Jos..

The D-aldohexose dehydrogenase from the thermoacidophilic archaea Thermoplasma acidophilum (AldT) belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily and catalyzes the oxidation of several monosaccharides with a preference for NAD(+) rather than NADP(+) as a cofactor. It has been found that AldT is a unique enzyme that exhibits the highest dehydrogenase activity against D-mannose. Here, we describe the crystal structures of AldT in ligand-free form, in complex with NADH, and in complex with the substrate D-mannose, at 2.1 A, 1.65 A, and 1.6 A resolution, respectively. The AldT subunit forms a typical SDR fold with an unexpectedly long C-terminal tail and assembles into an intertwined tetramer. The D-mannose complex structure reveals that Glu84 interacts with the axial C2 hydroxyl group of the bound D-mannose.

Fructosyltransferases, like the Lactobacillus reteri levansucrase, are important for the production of new fructosyloligosaccharides. Various His(6)- and Strep-tagged variants of this enzyme were recombinantly produced and exported into the growth medium using the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium. Nutrient-rich growth medium significantly enhanced levansucrase production and export. The B. megaterium signal peptide of the extracellular esterase LipA mediated better levansucrase export compared to the one of the penicillin amidase Pac. The combination of protein export via the LipA signal peptide with the coexpression of the signal peptidase gene sipM further increased the levansucrase secretion. Fused affinity tags allowed the efficient one-step purification of the recombinant proteins from the growth medium. However, fused peptide tags led to slightly decreased secretion of tested fusion proteins.

This work provides functional data showing that the bacterial CYP102A1 recognises compounds metabolised by human CYP3A4, CYP2E1 and CYP1A2 and is able to catalyse different reactions. Wild-type cytochrome CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium is a catalytically self-sufficient enzyme, containing an NADPH-dependent reductase and a P450 haem domain fused in a single polypeptidie chain. An NADPH-dependent method (Tsotsou et al. in Biosens. Bioelectron. 17:119-131, 2002) together with spectroscopic assays were applied to investigate the catalytic activity of CYP102A1 towards 19 xenobiotics, including 17 commercial drugs. These molecules were chosen to represent typical substrates of the five main families of drug-metabolising human cytochromes P450. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that CYP102A1 catalyses the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone, aniline and p-nitrophenol, as well as the N-dealkylation of propranolol and the dehydrogenation of nifedipine.

The well established production host Escherichia coli relies on the secretion into the periplasmic space for antibody synthesis. Due to the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, only a fraction of this material reaches the medium. Recently, the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium was shown to efficiently secrete recombinant proteins into the growth medium. Here we evaluated B. megaterium for the recombinant production of antibody fragments. The lysozyme specific single chain Fv (scFv) fragment D1.3 was successfully produced using B. megaterium. The impact of culture medium composition, gene expression time and culture temperatures on the production of functional scFv protein was systematically analyzed.

In order to produce potentially more- or less-active, toxic, or inactive metabolites compared to steviol (2), its microbial metabolism was investigated. Incubation of 2 with the microorganisms Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581, Mucor recurvatus MR 36, and Aspergillus niger BCRC 32720 yielded one new metabolite, ent-7alpha,11beta,13-trihydroxykaur-16-en-19-oic acid (7), together with four known related biotransformation products, ent-7alpha,13-dihydroxykaur-16-en-19-oic acid (3), ent-13-hydroxykaur-16-en-19-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl ester (4), ent-13,16beta,17-trihydroxykauran-19-oic acid (5), and ent-13-hydroxy-7-ketokaur-16-en-19-oic acid (6). The preliminary testing of antihyperglycemic effects showed that 5 was more potent than the parent compound (2). Thus, the microbial metabolism of steviol-16alpha,17-epoxide (8) with M. recurvatus MR 36 was continued to produce higher amounts of 5 for future study of its action mechanism.

As spore-surface interactions may bias inactivation experiments, we evaluated the relative binding of different spores to carrier materials. The survival of spores deposited on glass, metallic or polymeric surfaces were quantitatively measured by ASTM standard method E-2414-05 which recovers spores from surfaces by increasing stringency.

Aiming at to enhance the production of penicillin G acylase (PGA) by Bacillus megaterium, we have performed flasks experiments using different medium composition. Using 51 g/L of casein hydrolyzed with Alcalase and 2.7 g/L of phenylacetic acid (PhAc), the following carbon substrates were tested, individually and combined: glucose, glycerol, and lactose (present in cheese whey). Glycerol and glucose showed to be effective nutrients for the microorganism growth but delayed the PGA production. Cheese whey always increased enzyme production and cell mass. However, lactose (present in cheese whey) was not a significant carbon source for B. megaterium. PhAc, amino acids, and small peptides present in the hydrolyzed casein were the actual carbon sources for enzyme production. Replacement of hydrolyzed casein by free amino acids, 10.0 g/L, led to a significant increase in enzyme production (app. 150%), with a preferential consumption of alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, serine, arginine, threon	2007	9	13	Biotechnol Bioeng	Biotechnology and bioengineering	Amino Acids; Bacillus megaterium; Bacteriological Techniques; Caseins; Culture Media; Hydrolysis; Penicillin Amidase	Pinotti	Laura Marina
16964623	10.1002/bit.21145	Plasmid system for the intracellular production and purification of affinity-tagged proteins in Bacillus megaterium.	A multiple vector system for the intracellular high-level production of affinity tagged recombinant proteins in Bacillus megaterium was developed. The N- and C-terminal fusion of a protein of interest to a Strep II and a His(6)-tag is possible. Corresponding genes are expressed under the control of a xylose-inducible promoter in a xylose isomerase deficient host strain. The exemplatory protein production of green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed differences in produced and recovered protein amounts in dependence of the employed affinity tag and its N- or C-terminal location. Up to 9 mg GFP per liter shake flask culture were purified using one-step affinity chromatography. Integration of a protease cleavage site into the recombinant fusion protein allowed tag removal via tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease or Factor Xa treatment and a second affinity chromatographic step. Up to 274 mg/L culture were produced at 52 g CDW/L using a glucose limited fedbatch cultivation.

Production and secretion of a 28,172 Da hydrolase from Thermobifida fusca (TFH) in Bacillus megaterium MS941 and WH323 was investigated in shake flask and pH controlled bioreactors. Successful production of heterologous TFH was achieved by adapting the original tfh gene to the optimal codon usage of B. megaterium. A codon adaption index close to one was reached. The codon optimized tfh was cloned into an open reading frame with DNA sequence for the N-terminal signal peptide of B. megaterium lipase A and a C-terminal His(6)-tag, all under the control of a xylose inducible promoter. Successful TFH production and secretion were observed using batch reactor cultivations with complex medium. Expression of the tfh gene from the P(xylA) promoter and secretion of produced TFH were compared in detail to batch reactor cultivations with semi-defined growth medium. For the first time, significant TFH secretion was achieved using a semi-defined medium in glucose limited fed batch cultivations yield	2007	3	22	Biotechnol Bioeng	Biotechnology and bioengineering	Actinomycetales; Bacillus megaterium; Codon, Initiator; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genetic Enhancement; Hydrolases; Industrial Microbiology; Recombinant Proteins	Yang	Yang

Discrimination of bacteria was investigated using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-differential mobility spectrometry (Py-GC-DMS). Three strains belonging to the genus Bacillus were investigated and these included two strains of Bacillus subtilis and a single Bacillus megaterium. These were chosen so as to evaluate the possibility of bacterial strain discrimination using Py-GC-DMS. The instrument was constructed in-house and the long-term reproducibility of the instrument was evaluated over a period of 60 days using a Scotch whisky quality control. To assess the reproducibility further each bacterium was cultured six times and each culture was analysed in replicate to give three analytical replicates. The DMS data were generated in both positive and negative modes, and the data in each mode were analysed independently of each other.

A beta-amylase gene (amyG) was cloned from a Bacillus megaterium WS06 and expressed in the Escherichia coli. Nucleotide sequence anlysis showed the amyG gene is composed of 1638 bp (545 amino acid residues with a Mr of 60.194 kD). The AmyG shows 94.5% sequence homologies with beta-amylase from Bacillus megaterium DSM319 and presents a normal beta-amylase primary structure, constituted by three parts: the N-terminal signal sequence, the catalytic domain and the C-terminal starch binding domains. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed that several highly conserved regions of the glycosylhydrolase family 14.

The cabbage butterfly (Artogeia rapae) antimicrobial peptide hinnavinII as a member of cecropin family is synthesized as 37 residues in size with an amidated lysine at C-terminus and shows the humoral immune response to a bacterial invasion. In this work, a synthetic gene for hinnavinII-38-Asn (HIN) with an additional amino acid asparagine residue containing amide group at C-terminus was cloned into pET-32a(+) vector to allow expression of HIN as a Trx fusion protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The resulting expression level of the fusion protein Trx-HIN could reach 15-20% of the total cell proteins and more than 70% of the target proteins were in soluble form. The fusion protein could be purified successfully by HiTrap Chelating HP column and a high yield of 15 mg purified fusion protein was obtained from 80 ml E. coli culture.

Suspended microbial aggregates, which are always in dynamic equilibrium with suspended cells and cells attached to surface, are very common structures in natural and engineering environmental systems. To study and design physiologically diverse suspended microbial aggregates the physiological classification of chemotrophic prokaryotes in 12 groups formed by four evolutionary periods (fermenting, anaerobic respiring, microaerophilic and facultative aerobic, aerobic prokaryotes) and three parallel lines (Gram-negative, Gram-positive Eubacteria, and Archaea) could be used. This type of physiological heterogeneity has been studied in microbial granules using fluorescence in situ hybridization, identification of 16S rRNA genes, and conferring the physiological properties from the description of the species.

Despite sharing sequence and structural similarities with other diflavin reductases such as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) and nitric oxide synthase, flavocytochrome P450BM-3 displays some unique redox and electron transferring properties, including the inability to thermodynamically stabilize the neutral semiquinone (SQ) state of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. Rather, the anionic SQ species is only transiently formed during rapid reduction. Why is this? The absence of a conserved glycine residue and, as a consequence, the shorter and less flexible cofactor-binding loop in P450BM-3 represents a notable difference from other diflavin reductases and the structurally related flavodoxin. This difference may facilitate the formation of a strong hydrogen bond between backbone amide NH group of Asn537 and N5 of the oxidized FMN, an interaction not found in the other proteins. In the flavodoxin, the conserved glycine residue plays a crucial role in a redox-linked conformation	2009	1	26	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Coenzymes; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Flavin Mononucleotide; Glycine; Hydrogen Bonding; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Insertional; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Conformation	Chen	Huai-Chun
19052297		Identification of aerobic gut bacteria from the kala azar vector, Phlebotomus argentipes: a platform for potential paratransgenic manipulation of sand flies.	Visceral leishmaniasis is an understudied parasitic disease responsible for significant global morbidity and mortality. We are presently investigating a method of disease prevention termed paratransgenesis. In this approach, symbiotic or commensal bacteria are transformed to produce anti-Leishmania molecules. The transformed bacteria are delivered back to sand flies to inactivate the parasite within the vector itself. In this study, we identified 28 distinct gut microorganisms from Phlebotomus argentipes trapped from four visceral leishmaniasis-endemic sites in India. A significant percent of Staphylococcus spp., environmental bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae were identified. Two non-pathogenic organisms, Bacillus megaterium and Brevibacterium linens, were also isolated. Both organisms are also used extensively in industry. Our results indicate that B. megaterium and B. linens are possible candidates for use in a model of paratransgenesis to prevent transmission of Leishmania.	2009	1	5	Am J Trop Med Hyg	The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene	Animals; Bacteria, Aerobic; Genetic Engineering; Insect Vectors; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Phlebotomus	Hillesland	Heidi

The keratinase gene from Bacillus licheniformis MKU3 was cloned and successfully expressed in Bacillus megaterium MS941 as well as in Pichia pastoris X33. Compared with parent strain, the recombinant B. megaterium produced 3-fold increased level of keratinase while the recombinant P. pastoris strain had produced 2.9-fold increased level of keratinase. The keratinases from recombinant P. pastoris (pPZK3) and B. megaterium MS941 (pWAK3) were purified to 67.7- and 85.1-folds, respectively, through affinity chromatography. The purified keratinases had the specific activity of 365.7 and 1277.7 U/mg, respectively. Recombinant keratinase from B. megaterium was a monomeric protein with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa which was appropriately glycosylated in P. pastoris to have a molecular mass of 39 kDa.

The capability of two oxidative catalysts, a laccase from Rhus vernicifera and birnessite, a manganese oxide, in the dephenolization and detoxification of two olive-mill wastewater (OMW) samples, C1 and C2, differing for complexity and composition, was evaluated. OMW phenolic extracts (EC1 and EC2) and mono-substrate solutions of phenols mostly present in OMW samples were also tested. Birnessite was more effective than laccase in removing the phenolic content from mono-substrate solutions (more than 70% of each initial phenolic concentration) and of either OMW samples or EC1 and EC2 extracts. For instance, 60% of the total phenolic content of EC1 was removed after 48-h treatment with 5 mg mL(-1) birnessite and the efficiency was lower as greater was the complexity of the OMW sample (only 17% removal from EC2 over the same time span).

Due to the large size and poor stability of the proteins, the active recombinant TcdA and TcdB have been difficult to produce. The toxin genes tcdA and tcdB were amplified by PCR using chromosomal DNA from a toxigenic strain as a template, and cloned into a shuttle vector pHis1522. The sequences of both tcdA and tcdB genes in the vector have been verified by DNA sequencing. The constructs were transformed into B. megaterium protoplasts and the protein expression was controlled under a xylose promoter. The recombinant toxins (rTcdA and rTcdB) were purified from bacterial crude extracts. Approximately 5 - 10 mg of highly purified recombinant toxins were obtained from one liter of bacterial culture.

Cytochrome P450 BM-3 monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) catalyzes the subterminal hydroxylation of fatty acids with a chain length of 12-22 carbons. Wild-type P450 BM-3 oxidizes saturated fatty acids at subterminal positions producing a mixture of omega-1, omega-2 and omega-3 hydroxylated products. Using a rational site-directed mutagenesis approach, three new elements have been introduced into the substrate binding pocket of the monooxygenase, which greatly changed the product pattern of lauric acid hydroxylation. Particularly, substitutions at positions S72, V78 and I263 had an effect on the enzyme regioselectivity. The P450 BM-3 mutants V78A F87A I263G and S72Y V78A F87A were able to oxidize lauric acid not only at delta-position (14% and 16%, respectively), but also produced gamma- and beta-hydroxylated products. delta-Hydroxy lauric and gamma-hydroxy lauric acid are important synthons for the production of the corresponding lactones.	2009	5	11	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Computer Simulation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Lauric Acids; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Conformation; Stereoisomerism; Substrate Specificity	Dietrich	Matthias

Site-directed mutagenesis and functionalization of gold surfaces have been combined to obtain a stable immobilization of the heme domain of cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium.

The molecular basis for differences in germinant recognition of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spores containing the GerVB and/or GerUB receptor proteins has been examined by site-directed mutagenesis and the construction of cross-homologue chimeras. Focusing on nonconserved residues predicted to reside in transmembrane domains 9 and 10, we demonstrate that GerVB residues Ser319 and Leu345 are of particular importance in defining the specificity and apparent affinity of the receptor for germinants. Kinetic analyses of mutants with different amino acid substitutions at these positions indicate that Ser319 and Leu345 are not involved directly in the binding of germinants, but probably reside in regions of the receptor where structural perturbations can affect the conformation of, or access to, germinant binding sites. Position 345 is also shown to be of importance in GerUB, where the F345A mutation severely impairs receptor function.

Cyclic voltabsorptometry is used for the first time to distinguish and characterize electrochemically the active (P450) and inactive (P420) forms of cytochromes P450 immobilized on an electrode during voltammetry experiments. This was achieved by using the heme domain (BMP) of the bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) immobilized on mesopouros tin-oxide (SnO2) electrodes. We demonstrate that the formation of either the P450 form or the P420 one can be obtained by modifying the mesoporous electrode surface with polycations with different properties such as polyethylenimmine (PEI) and polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA). Potential step spectroelectrochemistry allowed measurement of reduction potentials of the active P450 form. Values of -0.39+/-0.01 V and -0.58+/-0.01 V (both versus Ag/AgCl) were calculated for the active P450 form immobilized on the BMP/PDDA-SnO2 and BMP/PEI-SnO2 electrodes, respectively.

18830657	10.1007/s11745-008-3236-8	Molecular evolution of a steroid hydroxylating cytochrome P450 using a versatile steroid detection system for screening.	Molecular evolution is a powerful tool for improving or changing activities of enzymes for their use in biotechnological processes. Cytochromes P450 are highly interesting enzymes for biotechnological purposes because they are able to hydroxylate a broad variety of substrates with high regio- and stereoselectivity. One promising steroid hydroxylating cytochrome P450 for biotechnological applications is CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368. It is one of a few known bacterial cytochromes P450 able to transform steroids such as progesterone and 11-deoxycortisol. CYP106A2 can be easily expressed in Escherichia coli with a high yield and can be reconstituted using the adrenal redox proteins, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. We developed a simple screening assay for this system and performed random mutagenesis of CYP106A2, yielding variants with improved 11-deoxycortisol and progesterone hydroxylation activity.

18820909	10.1007/s00253-008-1678-9	Improved PCR method for the creation of saturation mutagenesis libraries in directed evolution: application to difficult-to-amplify templates.	Saturation mutagenesis constitutes a powerful method in the directed evolution of enzymes. Traditional protocols of whole plasmid amplification such as Stratagene's QuikChange sometimes fail when the templates are difficult to amplify. In order to overcome such restrictions, we have devised a simple two-primer, two-stage polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method which constitutes an improvement over existing protocols. In the first stage of the PCR, both the mutagenic primer and the antiprimer that are not complementary anneal to the template. In the second stage, the amplified sequence is used as a megaprimer. Sites composed of one or more residues can be randomized in a single PCR reaction, irrespective of their location in the gene sequence.The method has been applied to several enzymes successfully, including P450-BM3 from Bacillus megaterium, the lipases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida antarctica and the epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus niger. Here, we show that megaprimer 	2008	12	1	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Aspergillus niger; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Candida; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Epoxide Hydrolases; Gene Library; Lipase; Mutagenesis; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pseudomonas aeruginosa	Sanchis	Joaquin

Free-living amoebae of the genus Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. Here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of Acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. All bacteria assayed induced a dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) mL(-1); except for M. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. In addition, Acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. Single-dose experiments indicated a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of M. luteus, E. co	2009	1	5	FEMS Microbiol Ecol	FEMS microbiology ecology	Acanthamoeba castellanii; Animals; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Colony Count, Microbial; Escherichia coli K12; Feeding Behavior; Microbial Viability; Micrococcus luteus; Phagocytosis; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Trophozoites	de Moraes	Josu..

The DNA fragment of heat shock genes (hrcA-grpE-dnaK-dnaJ) containing complete hrcA-grpE-dnaK operon and the transcription unit of dnaJ was cloned, sequensed and analyzed from Bacillus megaterium RF5. The sequence of hrcA, grpE and dnaJ were first time reported, and their coding products exibit 60%, 63% and 81% of identities to the homologs of B. subtilis. A sigmaA-type promoter of Gram-positive bacteria (PA1) and a terminator were located upstream of the hrcA and downstream of dnaK, and a Controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression element (CIRCE) was identified between PA1 and hrcA. Another sigmaA-type promoter (PA2) and a terminator were found upstream and downstream of dnaJ, indicating B. megaterium has a transcription unit containing a single gene dnaJ. The structure of dnaJ transcription unit is more similar to that of Listeria monocytogenes than other species of Bacillus.

18776694	10.1271/bbb.80294	Interactions between two MerR regulators and three operator/promoter regions in the mercury resistance module of Bacillus megaterium.	The mercury resistance module of Bacillus transposon TnMERI1 is regulated by three operator/promoter regions (O/P merB3, O/P merR1, and O/P merR2) and two regulatory proteins (MerR1 and MerR2) encoded by the module itself. To clarify the roles of MerR1 and MerR2 in the regulatory mechanism, both proteins were overexpressed and purified. MerR1 bound the regulatory regions O/P merB3 and O/P merR1, with a preference for O/P merB3 as measured on in vitro gel shift assays. However, MerR2 bound O/P merR2, as revealed by gel shift and restriction endonuclease protection assays. The transcriptional start sites of O/P merB3 and O/P merR2 were determined by rapid amplification of 5'-cDNA ends (5'-RACE) in the TnMERI1 original host, Bacillus megaterium strain MB1. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays showed that O/P merB3 and O/P merR1 were induced in the presence of Hg2+ but not O/P merR2. It was concluded that MerR1 regulates O/P merB3 and O/P merR1, while M	2008	12	18	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Mercury; Molecular Sequence Data; Operator Regions, Genetic; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic	Chen	Ching-Yi

Production of indole acetic acid demonstrated in broth assays was another important plant growth promoting character. The bacterium produced diffusible and volatile compounds that inhibited the growth of two phytopathogens viz. Alternaria alternata and Fusarium oxysporum. The carrier based formulations of the bacterium resulted in increased plant growth in bioassays.

By simultaneously scanning both the excitation and emission monochromators of a common spectrofluorometer with same starting excitation and emission wavelength (namely, Delta lambda = 0), we obtained synchronous light scattering (SLS) signals that related to Rayleigh and Mie scatterings. It was found that the SLS signals could be applied for quantitation and differentiation of model bioparticles such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus megaterium. In PBS buffer, these model bioparticles could form colloidal suspensions or dispersions of sizes ranging from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers, giving SLS signals with the intensity being proportional to the amount of bioparticles in the range from 1.7 x 10 (5) to 1.7 x 10 (9) CFU/mL.

18689470	10.1128/JB.00557-08	Cloning and characterization of the DNA region responsible for Megacin A-216 production in Bacillus megaterium 216.	Upon induction, Bacillus megaterium 216 produces the bacteriocin megacin A-216, which leads to lysis of the producer cell and kills B. megaterium and a few other bacterial species. The DNA region responsible for megacinogeny was cloned in B. megaterium. The nucleotide sequence of a 5,494-bp-long subfragment was determined, and the function of the genes on this fragment was studied by generating deletions and analyzing their effects on MegA phenotypes. An open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 293-amino-acid protein was identified as the gene (megA) coding for megacin A-216. BLAST searches detected sequence similarity between megacin A-216 and proteins with phospholipase A2 activity. Purified biologically active megacin A-216 preparations contained three proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the largest protein is the full-length translation product of the megA gene, whereas the two shorter proteins are fragments of the long protein created by cleavage between Gln-185 and Val-18	2009	1	7	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Bacillus megaterium; Chromatography, Gel; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Megacins; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Open Reading Frames; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization	Kiss	Antal

A novel beta-galactosidase of 120 kDa (BgaBM) from Bacillus megaterium 2-37-4-1 was purified, and its gene (bgaBM) was analyzed and expressed. It displayed wide acceptor specificity for transglycosylation with a series of acceptors, including pentose, hexose, hydroxyl, and alkyl alcohol using o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactoside (ONPG) as a donor. BgaBM preferentially hydrolyzed ONPG in all tested substrates and showed maximum activity at pH 7.5-8.0 and 55 degrees C. It was stable at pH 6.0-9.0 below 40 degrees C. The K(m) and V(max) values for ONPG and lactose were 9.5 mM, 16.6 mM/min and 12.6 mM, 54.4 mM/min, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the bgaBM gene consists of an ORF of 3,105 bp corresponding to 118 kDa protein, which indicates that BgaBM is a modular enzyme in the glycosyl hydrolase family 2, including conserved sugar-binding domain, acid-base catalyst, and immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich domain.

18669819	10.1093/jxb/ern197	Brassica juncea chitinase BjCHI1 inhibits growth of fungal phytopathogens and agglutinates Gram-negative bacteria.	Brassica juncea BjCHI1 is a plant chitinase with two chitin-binding domains. Its expression, induced in response to wounding, methyl jasmonate treatment, Aspergillus niger infection, and caterpillar Pieris rapae feeding, suggests that it plays a role in defence. In this study, to investigate the potential of using BjCHI1 in agriculture, Pichia-expressed BjCHI1 and its deletion derivatives that lack one or both chitin-binding domains were tested against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. Transplastomic tobacco expressing BjCHI1 was also generated and its extracts assessed. In radial growth-inhibition assays, BjCHI1 and its derivative with one chitin-binding domain showed anti-fungal activities against phytopathogens, Colletotrichum truncatum, C. acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Ascochyta rabiei. BjCHI1 also inhibited spore germination of C. truncatum. Furthermore, BjCHI1, but not its derivatives lacking one or both domains, inhibited the growth of Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia col	2008	10	27	J Exp Bot	Journal of experimental botany	Chitinases; Fungi; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Mustard Plant; Pichia; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Spores, Fungal; Tobacco	Guan	Yuanfang

Our goal was to ultimately predict the sensitivity of untested bacteria (including those of biodefense interest) to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In this study, we present an overview and analysis of the relevant 254 nm data previously reported and available in the literature. The amount of variability in this data prevented us from determining an "average" response for any bacterium. Therefore, we developed particular selection criteria to include the data in our analysis and suggested future guidelines for reporting UV sensitivity results. We then compiled a table of the sensitivity to 254 nm UV for 38 bacteria and three bacterial spores. The UV sensitivity was quite similar (within 10%) among the spores of Bacillus anthracis (strains Vollum 1B and Sterne), Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium. These data indicate that spores of B. subtilis and B. megaterium could be adequate simulants of B. anthracis spores in UVC experiments.

18590226		[Phylogeny and diversity of endophytic Bacillus isolated from medicinal plants].	The biodiversity of endophytic Bacillus isolated from Medicinal plants was studied. Endophytic bacillus isolated from medicinal plants and reference strains were characterized by numerical taxonomy, 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP, BOX-PCR fingerprints and 16S rDNA sequence to describe the phenotypic and genetic diversity and phylogeny. The phenotypic characterization of these strains showed that most of these strains had high stress resistance. There were 13 clusters formed at 84% similarity by numerical taxonomy. The genetic diversity was highly revealed by 16S rDNA PCR-RFLP. The diversity of genomic level was described by BOX-PCR fingerprints. The results were correlated well with numerical analysis. Homology analysis was made by searching in Genbank with NCBI, and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed. Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that SCAU11 was highly related to B. sphaericus, SCAU78 and SCAU25 were identified as B. subtilis subspecies, SCAU39 was highly related to B. megaterium	2009	5	15	Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica	Bacillus; Biodiversity; DNA, Ribosomal; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Genetic Variation; Phylogeny; Plants, Medicinal; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Chen	Lan
18588505	10.1042/BJ20080785	Structure and function of SirC from Bacillus megaterium: a metal-binding precorrin-2 dehydrogenase.	In Bacillus megaterium, the synthesis of vitamin B(12) (cobalamin) and sirohaem diverges at sirohydrochlorin along the branched modified tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway. This key intermediate is made by the action of SirC, a precorrin-2 dehydrogenase that requires NAD(+) as a cofactor. The structure of SirC has now been solved by X-ray crystallography to 2.8 A (1 A = 0.1 nm) resolution. The protein is shown to consist of three domains and has a similar topology to the multifunctional sirohaem synthases Met8p and the N-terminal region of CysG, both of which catalyse not only the dehydrogenation of precorrin-2 but also the ferrochelation of sirohydrochlorin to give sirohaem. Guided by the structure, in the present study a number of active-site residues within SirC were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. No active-site general base was identified, although surprisingly some of the resulting protein variants were found to have significantly enhanced catalytic activity.

Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase, produced by Bacillus megaterium, was characterized, and the biochemical properties of the purified enzyme were determined. The substrate specificity of the enzyme was tested with different alpha-1,4-glucans. Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase displayed maximum activity in the case of soluble starch, with a Km value of 3.4 g/L. The optimal pH and temperature values for the cyclization reaction were 7.2 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at pH 6.0-10.5 and 30 degrees C. The enzyme activity was activated by Sr2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Mn2+, and Cu2+, and it was inhibited by Zn2+ and Ag+.

The molecular basis of regioselectivity of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) with its flexible and widely opened active site is still not well understood. In the present work (-)-alpha-pinene bound complexes with two triple mutants were modeled to elucidate the contribution of the three major factors that mediate selectivity: active site shape, protein flexibility, and chemical reactivity of the substrate. For the triple mutant A74G F87V L188Q (GVQ), one stable, productive conformation of the substrate (conformation I) was identified by multiple molecular dynamics simulations. The model predicts pinene epoxide as a major product (42% pinene oxide, 23% verbenol) which is in agreement with the experimental product profile (70% pinene oxide, 20% verbenol).

Blennolides A-G (2-8), seven unusual chromanones, were isolated together with secalonic acid B (1) from Blennoria sp., an endophytic fungus from Carpobrotus edulis. This is the first reported isolation of the blennolides 2 and 3 (hemisecalonic acids B and E), the existence of which as the monomeric units of the dimeric secalonic acids had long been postulated. A compound of the proposed structure 4 (beta-diversonolic ester) will need to be revised, as its reported data do not fit those of the established structure of blennolide C (4). Other monomers, the blennolides D-F (5-7) seem to be derived from blennolides A (2) and B (3) by rearrangement of the hydroaromatic ring. The heterodimer 8, composed of the monomeric blennolide A (2) and the rearranged 11-dehydroxy derivative of blennolide E (6), extends the ergochrome family with an ergoxanthin type of skeleton.

19704649	10.4161/psb.3.4.5204	Plant growth promotion by Bacillus megaterium involves cytokinin signaling.	Accumulating evidence indicates that plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) influence plant growth and development by the production of phytohormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins. Little is known on the genetic basis and signal transduction components that mediate the beneficial effects of PGPRs in plants. We recently reported the identification of a Bacillus megaterium strain that promoted growth of A. thaliana and P. vulgaris seedlings. In this addendum, the role of cytokinin signaling in mediating the plant responses to bacterial inoculation was investigated using A. thaliana mutants lacking one, two or three of the putative cytokinin receptors CRE1, AHK2 and AHK3, and RPN12 a gene involved in cytokinin signaling. We show that plant growth promotion by B. megaterium is reduced in AHK2-2 single and double mutant combinations and in RPN12. Furthermore, the triple cytokinin-receptor CRE1-12/AHK2-2/AHK3-3 knockout was insensitive to inoculation in terms of growth pr	2012	10	2	Plant Signal Behav	Plant signaling &amp; behavior	Arabidopsis; plant growth stimulation; rhizobacteria; root development	Ort..z-Castro	Randy

This study investigates how thermally treated (i.e., torrefied) grass, a new prospective ingredient of potting soils, is colonized by microorganisms. Torrefied grass fibers (TGF) represent a specific colonizable niche, which is potentially useful to establish a beneficial microbial community that improves plant growth. TGF and torrefied grass extracts (TGE) were inoculated with a suspension of microorganisms obtained from soil. Sequential microbial enrichment steps were then performed in both substrates. The microbial communities developing in the substrates were assessed using cultivation-based and cultivation-independent approaches. Thus, bacterial isolates were obtained, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analyses for bacterial communities were performed. Partial sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from isolates and bands from DGGE gels showed diverse communities after enrichment in TGE and TGF.

To determine the wet and dry density of spores of Bacillus anthracis and compare these values with the densities of other Bacillus species grown and sporulated under similar conditions. We prepared and studied spores from several Bacillus species, including four virulent and three attenuated strains of B. anthracis, two Bacillus species commonly used to simulate B. anthracis (Bacillus atrophaeus and Bacillus subtilis) and four close neighbours (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus stearothermophilus), using identical media, protocols and instruments. We determined the wet densities of all spores by measuring their buoyant density in gradients of Percoll and their dry density in gradients of two organic solvents, one of high and the other of low chemical density. The wet density of different strains of B. anthracis fell into two different groups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the crude extract of the twigs of Dorstenia barteri (DBT) as well as that of four of the five flavonoids isolated from this extract. Gram-positive bacteria (six species), Gram-negative bacteria (12 species) and fungi (four species) were used. The agar disc diffusion test was used to determine the sensitivity of the tested samples while the well micro-dilution was used to determine the minimal inhibition concentrations (MIC) and the minimal microbicidal concentration (MMC) of the active samples. The results of the disc diffusion assay showed that DBT, isobavachalcone (1), and kanzonol C (4) prevented the growth of all the 22 tested microbial species. Other compounds showed selective activity. The inhibitory activity of the most active compounds namely compounds 1 and 4 was noted on 86.4% of the tested microorganisms and that of 4-hydroxylonchocarpin (3) was observed on 72.7%.

18203825	10.1128/JB.01687-07	Functional consequences of amino acid substitutions to GerVB, a component of the Bacillus megaterium spore germinant receptor.	The extreme metabolic dormancy and resistance properties of spores formed by members of the Bacillus and Clostridium genera are lost upon exposure to a variety of small-molecule germinants. Germinants are known to interact in an as yet undefined manner with cognate receptor complexes that reside in the inner membrane that surrounds the spore protoplast. The receptor itself is a complex of at least three proteins, and in this study we identify amino acid residues, predicted to lie in loop regions of GerVB on the exterior aspect of the membrane, that influence the Bacillus megaterium spore germination response. Three consecutive residues adjacent to putative transmembrane domain 10 (TM10) were demonstrated to mediate to various degrees the proline germinative response while also influencing germination in response to leucine, glucose, and inorganic salts, suggesting that this region may be part of a ligand binding pocket. Alternatively, substitutions in this region may affect the conform	2008	7	1	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Genetic Complementation Test; Kinetics; Leucine; Models, Biological; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Spores, Bacterial	Christie	Graham

Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus firmus, Bacillus sp.) and origins (probiotic and collection strains) to counteract the activity of some representative DNA-reactive agents. The inhibitory effect of 21 bacilli strains, previously characterized by tDNA-PCR, on four genotoxins, was examined in vitro using the short-term assay SOS-Chromotest. All strains had a high inhibitory activity against 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide and N-methyl-N'-nitro-nitrosoguanidine (direct agents), whereas the inhibitory activity was high or moderate against 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline and aflatoxin B1 (indirect agents).

Cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) production in Bacillus megaterium has served as a model system for the systematic evaluation of single and multiple directed molecular and genetic optimization strategies. Plasmid and genome-based overexpression of genes involved in vitamin B(12) biosynthesis, including cbiX, sirA, modified hemA, the operons hemAXCDBL and cbiXJCDETLFGAcysG(A)cbiYbtuR, and the regulatory gene fnr, significantly increased cobalamin production. To reduce flux along the heme branch of the tetrapyrrole pathway, an antisense RNA strategy involving silencing of the hemZ gene encoding coproporphyrinogen III oxidase was successfully employed. Feedback inhibition of the initial enzyme of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, HemA, by heme was overcome by stabilized enzyme overproduction.

The fermentation process of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2KGA) from L-sorbose was developed using a two-stage continuous fermentation system. The mixed culture of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare DSM 4025 and Bacillus megaterium DSM 4026 produced 90 g/L of 2KGA from 120 g/L of L-sorbose at the dilution rate of 0.01 h(-1) in a single-stage continuous fermentation process. But after the production period was beyond 150 h, the significant decrease of 2KGA productivity was observed. When the non-spore forming bacteria Xanthomonas maltophilia IFO 12692 was used instead of B. megaterium DSM 4026 as a partner strain for K. vulgare DSM 4025, the 2KGA productivity was significantly improved in a two-stage continuous culture mode, in which two fermentors of the same size and volume were connected in series. In this mode, with two sets of 3-L jar fermentors, the steady state could be continued to over 1,331.5 h at least, when the dilution rates were 0.0382 h(-1) and 0.0380 hour(-1), respectively, for the fir	2010	5	4	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Coculture Techniques; Fermentation; Rhodobacteraceae; Sorbose; Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; Sugar Acids	Takagi	Yoshinori

The deduced RfiA protein contains a DNA-binding domain characteristic of the LuxR family but lacks the autoinducer-binding terminus characteristic of the QS LuxR-family proteins. We also identified, downstream of rfiA, an operon designated pcoABC, encoding for the three components of a tripartite resistance nodulation-cell-division (RND) transporter system. The expression of pcoABC is regulated by RfiA. We found that lipodepsipeptide (LDP) production is cell density dependent and mutants of pcoI, pcoR, and rfiA are unable to inhibit the growth of the LDP-sensitive microorganisms Rhodotorula pilimanae and Bacillus megaterium. P. corrugata rfiA mutants were significantly redu	2010	3	12	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI	Bacterial Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Lycopersicon esculentum; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Plant Diseases; Pseudomonas; Quorum Sensing; Transcription Factors; Virulence	Licciardello	Grazia

To investigate the effects of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus megaterium in terms of toxin and growth of pathogenic Vibrio harveyi. Three Bacillus probionts were isolated from probiotic BZT aquaculture and identified using a 16S rDNA sequence. Growth inhibition assay showed that supernatants from the 24-h culture of three Bacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of V. harveyi (LMG 4044); B. subtilis was the most effective based on the well diffusion method. Results of a liquid culture model showed that B. subtilis was also widely effective in inhibiting three strains of V. harveyi (isolated from Thailand, the Philippines and LMG 4044), and that both B. licheniformis and B. megaterium inhibit the growth of V. harveyi isolated from the Philippines. Moreover, a haemolytic activity assay demonstrated that V. harveyi (IFO 15634) was significantly decreased by the addition of B. licheniformis or B. megaterium supernatant.

Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) is a 40-residue cationic peptide originally purified from human blood ultrafiltrate. The native peptide contains two disulfide bonds and is unique regarding its primary structure. Its biological role is not known but a previous study showed that chemically synthesized LEAP-2 exhibited in vitro antimicrobial activities against several Gram-positive bacteria. In order to determine its antimicrobial mode of action, we expressed human recombinant LEAP-2 in Escherichia coli. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses showed that the structure of the recombinant peptide was identical to that of the chemically synthesized and oxidized LEAP-2, with two disulfide bonds between Cys residues in relative 1-3 and 2-4 positions. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the recombinant human LEAP-2 was determined by a conventional broth dilution assay.

A rapidly growing marine derived Bacillus sp. strain NQ-11/A2, identified as Bacillus megaterium, accumulated 61% polyhydroxyalkanoate by weight. Diverse carbon sources served as substrates for the accumulation of short chain length polyhydroxyalkanoate. Three to nine granules either single or attached as buds could be isolated intact from each cell. Maximum activity of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase was associated with the granules. Granule-bound polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase had a K(m) of 7.1 x 10(-5) M for DL-beta-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Temperature and pH optima for maximum activity were 30 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. Sodium ions were required for granule-bound polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase activity and inhibited by potassium. Granule-bound polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase was apparently covalently bound to the polyhydroxyalkanoate-core of the granules and affected by the chaotropic reagent urea.

Polysaccharides comprise an extremely important class of biopolymers that play critical roles in a wide range of biological processes, but the synthesis of these compounds is challenging because of their complex structures. We have developed a chemoenzymatic method for regioselective deprotection of monosaccharide substrates using engineered Bacillus megaterium cytochrome P450 (P450(BM3)) demethylases that provides a highly efficient means to access valuable intermediates, which can be converted to a wide range of substituted monosaccharides and polysaccharides. Demethylases displaying high levels of regioselectivity toward a number of protected monosaccharides were identified using a combination of protein and substrate engineering, suggesting that this approach ultimately could be used in the synthesis of a wide range of substituted mono- and polysaccharides for studies in chemistry, biology, and medicine.	2009	12	28	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Carbohydrate Sequence; Catalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Monosaccharides; Oxidoreductases, N-Demethylating; Protein Conformation; Protein Engineering; Substrate Specificity	Lewis	Jared C

The present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of infusion, decoction and essential oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare) against 111 Gram-positive bacterial isolates belonging to 23 different species related to 3 genera. Infusion and essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. aureus, Micrococcus roseus, M. kristinae, M. nishinomiyaensis, M. lylae, M. luteus, M. sedentarius, M. varians, Bacillus megaterium, B. thuringiensis, B. alvei, B. circulans, B. brevis, B. coagulans, B. pumilus, B. laterosporus, B. polymyxa, B. macerans, B. subtilis, B. firmus, B. cereus and B. lichiniformis.

19774562	10.1002/chem.200900643	A panel of cytochrome P450 BM3 variants to produce drug metabolites and diversify lead compounds.	Herein we demonstrate that a small panel of variants of cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium covers the breadth of reactivity of human P450s by producing 12 of 13 mammalian metabolites for two marketed drugs, verapamil and astemizole, and one research compound. The most active enzymes support preparation of individual metabolites for preclinical bioactivity and toxicology evaluations. Underscoring their potential utility in drug lead diversification, engineered P450 BM3 variants also produce novel metabolites by catalyzing reactions at carbon centers beyond those targeted by animal and human P450s. Production of a specific metabolite can be improved by directed evolution of the enzyme catalyst. Some variants are more active on the more hydrophobic parent drug than on its metabolites, which limits production of multiply-hydroxylated species, a preference that appears to depend on the evolutionary history of the P450 variant.	2010	1	15	Chemistry	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	Astemizole; Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Chromones; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Evolution, Molecular; Humans; Morpholines; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Verapamil	Sawayama	Andrew M

Bacillus megaterium ALA2 NRRL B-21660 has been well studied for the production of many oxygenated unsaturated fatty acids from linoleic acid. Its major product, 12,13,17-trihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acid (12,13,17-THOA), inhibited the growth of many plant pathogenic fungi. However, we have been unable, until now, to demonstrate 12,13,17-THOA production in a fermentor. Here, we have investigated the effect of surfactants on 12,13,17-THOA production. Surfactant types (SO-25, Tween-80 and Triton X-100) at various concentrations were evaluated for their effects on cell growth and production of 12,13,17-THOA. Triton X-100 decreased cell growth and 12,13,17-THOA production while 1% Tween-80 increased 12,13,17-THOA production more than twofold over control. In a pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) controlled fermentor and with 1.0% Tween-80, both 12,13,17-THOA production and productivity increased to 553 mg/L and 24.0mg/L/hour, respectively.

A gram positive bacterium (designated strain SRKP-3) that potentially accumulated polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) was isolated from brackish water. From its morphological and physiological properties and nucleotide sequence of its 16S rRNA, it was suggested that strain SRKP-3 was similar to Bacillus megaterium. A four-factor central composite rotary design (CCRD) was employed to optimize the medium and to find out the interactive effects of four variables, viz. concentrations of dairy waste, rice bran, sea water and pH on PHB production. Using response surface methodology (RSM), a second-order polynomial equation was obtained by multiple regression analysis and a yield of 6.37 g/L of PHB dry weight was achieved from the optimized medium at pH 9. The same medium was utilized for fermentor studies by fed-batch culture. The dairy waste is fed at three different time intervals at 0 th, 12th and 24th hour to keep the carbon source as excess and PHB production was checked for every 3h.

19727832	10.1007/s00449-009-0377-y	Monitoring bioreactors using principal component analysis: production of penicillin G acylase as a case study.	The complexity of biological processes often makes impractical the development of detailed, structured phenomenological models of the cultivation of microorganisms in bioreactors. In this context, data pre-treatment techniques are useful for bioprocess control and fault detection. Among them, principal component analysis (PCA) plays an important role. This work presents a case study of the application of this technique during real experiments, where the enzyme penicillin G acylase (PGA) was produced by Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14945. PGA hydrolyzes penicillin G to yield 6-aminopenicilanic acid (6-APA) and phenyl acetic acid. 6-APA is used to produce semi-synthetic beta-lactam antibiotics. A static PCA algorithm was implemented for on-line detection of deviations from the desired process behavior. The experiments were carried out in a 2-L bioreactor.

Superdormant B. cereus spores were isolated by germination with high concentrations of inosine or L-alanine in 2-5% yield and did not germinate with high concentrations of either of these germinants, but germinated like starting spores with Ca-DPA, dodecylamine, L-alanine plus inosine or concentrated complete medium. Yields of superdormant spores from germinations with low inosine concentrations were higher, and these spores germinated poorly with low inosine, but relatively normally with high inosine. Yields of superdormant spores were also higher when nonheat-activated spores were germinated. Superdormant spores stored at 4 degrees C slowly recovered some germination capacity, but recovery was slowed significantly at -20 degrees C and -80 degrees C.

The CYP450 from Bacillus megaterium (BmCYP106A2) catalyzes the 15beta-hydroxylation of several steroids and also synthesizes mono-hydroxylated 9alpha- and 11alpha-OH-progesterone. This study reports on the ability of BmCYP106A2 to be efficiently reduced by the photosynthetic flavodoxin and, particularly, ferredoxin electron carriers from the cyanobacterium Anabaena. These results open the possibility for the design of a hybrid system to provide reducing equivalents for the hydroxylation process. Additionally, they suggest that despite the interaction of BmCYP106A2 with these proteins, particularly with flavodoxin, they do not rely on a precise complementarity of the reacting molecules, rearrangements might be required and alternative binding modes might contribute to the observed electron transfer reactions.	2009	12	14	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biochimica et biophysica acta	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cyanobacteria; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins; Ferredoxins; Flavodoxin; Kinetics; Steroid Hydroxylases; Thermodynamics	Go..i	Guillermina

However, these superdormant spores exhibited significant germination with the original or alternate germinants if the spores were heat activated at temperatures 8 to 15 degrees C higher than the optimal temperatures for the original dormant spores, although the levels of superdormant spore germination were not as great as those of dormant spores.

19561190	10.1128/AEM.00621-09	Identification and characterization of a novel intracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase from Bacillus megaterium.	A gene that codes for a novel intracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerase, designated PhaZ1, has been identified in the genome of Bacillus megaterium. A native PHB (nPHB) granule-binding assay showed that purified soluble PhaZ1 had strong affinity for nPHB granules. Turbidimetric analyses revealed that PhaZ1 could rapidly degrade nPHB granules in vitro without the need for protease pretreatment of the granules to remove surface proteins. Notably, almost all the final hydrolytic products produced from the in vitro degradation of nPHB granules by PhaZ1 were 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB) monomers. Unexpectedly, PhaZ1 could also hydrolyze denatured semicrystalline PHB, with the generation of 3HB monomers. The disruption of the phaZ1 gene significantly affected intracellular PHB mobilization during the PHB-degrading stage in B. megaterium, as demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy and the measurement of the PHB content.

The US has a large amount of surplus soybean oil annually, and using vegetable oils or their component fatty acids as starting material provides a new opportunity for bioindustry. Vegetable oils are relatively inexpensive and can be used to manufacture value-added products such as oxygenated oils and fatty acids. Oxygenated fatty acids are common in nature and are important industrial materials. They exist both in mammals and plants. Microorganisms oxidize fatty acids either at the terminal carbon or inside of the acyl chain to produce hydroxyl or keto fatty acids. In our continuing effort to produce value-added products from vegetable oils, we discovered more than one dozen novel oxygenated fatty acids through biotransformation.

A bench study was carried out to characterize the kinetics of two plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) Azotobacter chroococcum and Bacillus megaterium to adsorb heavy metals from solution. Adsorption of Pb(2+) and Cd(2+) by bacterial cells was processed quickly with an equilibration achieved within 5 min. The adsorptions were fitted well with Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. The comparison of isotherm parameters indicated that A. chroococcum had a stronger capacity to bind metal ions than B. megaterium, with an average increase of 59.8% for Pb(2+) and 75.6% for Cd(2+), respectively. Both bacteria had a stronger affinity to Pb(2+) than Cd(2+) since Pb(2+) was more easily bound with the phosphoryl groups on the cell surface than Cd(2+). This demonstrated that the presence of bacteria in the rhizosphere may result in the reduction of mobile ions in soil solution.	2009	9	2	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Adsorption; Bacillus megaterium; Cadmium; Kinetics; Lead; Plant Development; Plants; Rhizobium; Solutions; Time Factors	Wu	S C
19432415	10.1021/bi900607q	Functional characterization of the re-face loop spanning residues 536-541 and its interactions with the cofactor in the flavin mononucleotide-binding domain of flavocytochrome P450 from Bacillus megaterium.	Flavocytochrome P450BM-3, a bacterial monooxygenase, contains a flavin mononucleotide-binding domain bearing a strong structural homology to the bacterial flavodoxin. The flavin mononucleotide (FMN) serves as the one-electron donor to the heme iron, but in contrast to the electron transfer mechanism of mammalian cytochrome P450 reductase, the FMN semiquinone state is not thermodynamically stable and appears transiently as the anionic rather than the neutral form. A unique loop region comprised of residues (536)Y-N-G-H-P-P(541), which forms a type I' reverse turn and provides several interactions with the FMN isoalloxazine ring, was targeted in this study. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies support the presence of a strong hydrogen bond between the backbone amide of Asn537 and FMN N5, the anionic ionization state of the hydroquinone, and for a change in the hybridization state of the N5 upon reduction.

Aerobic mixed bacterial culture comprised of five isolates (Bacillus vallismortis, B. pumilus, B. cereus, B. subtilis and B. megaterium) identified by 16srDNA analysis was developed from wastewater samples from the aeration tank of an effluent treatment plant of a textile and dyeing industry and evaluated for its ability to decolorize azo dye Direct Red 28 in an up-flow immobilized packed bed bioreactor using marble chips as support matrix. The bioreactor was operated under two parameters: an aeration rate of 0.4 and 0.6 mmol/min at a flow rate of 60, 90 and 120 ml/h, respectively. At a constant aeration rate of 0.4 mmol/min and with flow rates of 60, 90 and 120 ml/h, optimum decolorization of 91, 75 and 72% was observed, while at an aeration rate of 0.6 mmol/min and flow rates of 60, 90 and 120 ml/h, optimum decolorization of 93, 78 and 72% was observed over 10 days.

Cathode design greatly affects microbial fuel cell (MFC) performance. Cathode contamination is inevitable in a single-chamber MFC yet it is impossible to study the magnitude of this effect in the single-chambered format. Therefore to study the effect of contamination at the cathode two-chamber MFCs must be used. The advantages of the two-chamber MFC design used in this study include: the assembled and filled fuel cell is autoclavable and the cathode can easily be moved from the submerged to air exposed position while maintaining sterility. This study was performed with the cathode in two positions: completely submerged in the catholyte and raised to a point where wicking action was used to coat the cathode with catholyte. When the cathode was submerged and the catholyte was inoculated with Bacillus megaterium, Shewanella oneidensis or Escherichia coli current generation was greatly decreased as compared to sterile.

Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 (BM3) is an NAD(P)H-binding diflavin reductase exhibiting substantial coenzyme specificity for NADPH over NADH. The side chains of serine 965, arginine 966 and lysine 972 in its FAD-binding domain bind the NADPH 2'-phosphate. Optical, kinetic and thermodynamic properties of S965A, R966A and K972A FAD domains were analyzed singly and combined with the FAD-shielding W1046A mutation. Steady-state and stopped-flow kinetic studies demonstrated substantially decreased NADPH affinity versus wild-type (WT) FAD domain (146-fold for the S965A K(d)). Considerable catalytic efficiency increases (the ratio of specificity constants, k(cat)/K(m), for the coenzymes) with NADH were observed for each point mutant over WT (570-fold in K972A), along with increased rates of NADH-dependent FAD reduction (k(lim) elevated 5.2-fold in R966A). In combination with W1046A, considerable (37 to 56-fold) improvements over WT were seen in the k(lim) parameters with NADH for all double mut	2009	9	1	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biochimica et biophysica acta	Amino Acid Sequence; Arginine; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide; Kinetics; Lysine; Molecular Sequence Data; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Sequence Alignment; Serine	Dunford	Adrian J
19308404	10.1007/s00253-009-1952-5	A T7 RNA polymerase-dependent gene expression system for Bacillus megaterium.	Gene expression systems based on the RNA polymerase of the bacteriophage T7 are often the ultimate choice for the high level production of recombinant proteins. During the last decade, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium was established as a useful host for the intra- and extracellular production of heterologous proteins. In this paper, we report on the development of a T7 RNA polymerase-dependent expression system for B. megaterium. The system was evaluated for cytosolic and secretory protein production with green fluorescent protein (GFP) from Aequoria victoria as intracellular and Lactobacillus reuteri levansucrase as extracellular model protein. GFP accumulated rapidly at high levels up to 50 mg/l shake flask culture intracellularly after induction of T7 RNA polymerase gene expression. The addition of rifampicin for the inhibition of B. megaterium RNA polymerase led to an increased stability of GFP.

To determine roles of cortex lytic enzymes (CLEs) in Bacillus megaterium spore germination. Genes for B. megaterium CLEs CwlJ and SleB were inactivated and effects of loss of one or both on germination were assessed. Loss of CwlJ or SleB did not prevent completion of germination with agents that activate the spore's germinant receptors, but loss of CwlJ slowed the release of dipicolinic acid (DPA). Loss of both CLEs also did not prevent release of DPA and glutamate during germination with KBr. However, cwlJ sleB spores had decreased viability, and could not complete germination. Loss of CwlJ eliminated spore germination with Ca2+ chelated to DPA (Ca-DPA), but loss of CwlJ and SleB did not affect DPA release in dodecylamine germination. CwlJ and SleB play redundant roles in cortex degradation during B. megaterium spore germination, and CwlJ accelerates DPA release and is essential for Ca-DPA germination.

19271725	10.1021/cb900006h	A novel semi-biosynthetic route for artemisinin production using engineered substrate-promiscuous P450(BM3).	Production of fine chemicals from heterologous pathways in microbial hosts is frequently hindered by insufficient knowledge of the native metabolic pathway and its cognate enzymes; often the pathway is unresolved, and the enzymes lack detailed characterization. An alternative paradigm to using native pathways is de novo pathway design using well-characterized, substrate-promiscuous enzymes. We demonstrate this concept using P450(BM3) from Bacillus megaterium. Using a computer model, we illustrate how key P450(BM3) active site mutations enable binding of the non-native substrate amorphadiene. Incorporating these mutations into P450(BM3) enabled the selective oxidation of amorphadiene artemisinic-11S,12-epoxide, at titers of 250 mg L(-1) in E. coli. We also demonstrate high-yielding, selective transformations to dihydroartemisinic acid, the immediate precursor to the high-value antimalarial drug artemisinin.	2009	6	22	ACS Chem Biol	ACS chemical biology	Algorithms; Artemisinins; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Catalytic Domain; Computer Simulation; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Mutation; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Polycyclic Sesquiterpenes; Protein Engineering; Sesquiterpenes; Stereoisomerism; Time Factors	Dietrich	Jeffrey A
19269585	10.1016/j.jbiosc.2008.10.006	Inexpensive fed-batch cultivation for high poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) production by a new isolate of Bacillus megaterium.	This research aimed at increasing the cell density and production of the homopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) by Bacillus megaterium BA-019, using renewable and inexpensive bioresources as a substrate. A higher cell density and a greater PHB production level were obtained by using sugarcane molasses and urea as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. The limitation of nitrogen at a C/N molar ratio of 25 resulted in enhanced cell growth and PHB production in batch cultures. Fed-batch cultivation with the feeding nutrient composed of MSM with sugarcane molasses, urea and trace elements, and controlled by a pH-stat feeding control, lead to a significantly enhanced cell concentration and PHB production. The optimal feeding medium in this system required a higher total sugar concentration (400 g/l) and a C/N molar ratio of 10 mol/mol. Under these conditions the highest attained cell mass (72.6 g/l DW) and PHB content (42% of cell dry wt.) were achieved in a short cultivation time (24 h)	2009	6	2	J Biosci Bioeng	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering	Bacillus megaterium; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; Fermentation; Hydroxybutyrates; Industrial Microbiology; Molasses; Oxygen; Polyesters; Urea	Kulpreecha	Songsri

The increasing demand for recombinant antibodies as detection reagents in research, diagnostics, and therapy requires appropriate production systems. In contrast to antibody therapies, small recombinant antibody fragments like Fab and scFv are sufficient for most applications in research and diagnostics. These antibody fragments can also be produced in bacterial hosts. Gram-negative bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli, were extensively studied for the recombinant antibody production but they showed only a limited capacity to secrete antibody fragments into the medium--a prerequisite for easy downstream processing. Gram-positive bacteria are known to efficiently secrete recombinant proteins into the medium. Recently, we demonstrated the production of scFv and scFab fragments in Bacillus megaterium. Here, we describe the process in detail from transformation of B. megaterium to production and purification of scFv fragments.	2009	4	22	Methods Mol Biol	Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)

In recent studies, the wild-type and mutant forms of cytochrome P450 (P450) BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium were found to metabolize various drugs through reactions similar to those catalyzed by human P450 enzymes. Therefore, it was suggested that CYP102A1 can be used to produce large quantities of the metabolites of human P450-catalyzed reactions. trans-Resveratrol (3,4',5-trihydroxystilbene), an anticancer-preventive agent, is oxidized by human P450 1A2 to produce two major metabolites, piceatannol (3,5,3',4'-tetrahydroxystilbene) and another hydroxylated product. In this report, we show that the oxidation of trans-resveratrol, a human P450 1A2 substrate, is catalyzed by wild-type and a set of CYP102A1 mutants. One major hydroxylated product, piceatannol, was produced as a result of the hydroxylation reaction. Other hydroxylated products were not produced.

The superdormant spores did, however, germinate with Ca(2+)-dipicolinic acid or dodecylamine. Although these superdormant spores did not germinate with high levels of nutrients that activated one or two nutrient germinant receptors, they germinated with nutrient mixtures that activated more receptors, and using high levels of nutrient mixtures activating more germinant receptors decreased superdormant spore yields.

21566350	10.1264/jsme2.me08540	Splicing of a bacterial group II intron from bacillus megaterium is independent of intron-encoded protein.	The splicing of a bacterial group II subclass B intron B.me.I1 from Bacillus megaterium chromosomes was investigated. RT-PCR and nucleic acid hybridization methods were used to understand the role of the intron-encoded protein (IEP) in the splicing of B.me.I1. An in vivo assay showed that the splicing occurred in the absence of IEP. An in vitro assay showed that B.me.I1 was spliced under conditions similar to those of the intracellular environment with no help from other biological molecules. Because all group II introns previously reported needed IEPs for their splicing in vivo, our results suggest that B.me.I1 is an "actual" self-splicing group II intron. This is also the first report to recognize the existence of group II introns that independently splice mRNA in vivo. The self-splicing of a bacterial intron may support that eukaryotic spliceosomal introns originated in bacterial genomes.	2011	7	7	Microbes Environ	Microbes and environments	NA	Chien	Mei-Fang

Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 is a catalytically self-sufficient fatty acid hydroxylase formed by fusion of soluble NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and P450 domains. Selected mutations at residue 264 in the haem (P450) domain of the enzyme lead to novel amino acid sixth (distal) co-ordination ligands to the haem iron. The catalytic, spectroscopic and thermodynamic properties of the A264M, A264Q and A264C variants were determined in both the intact flavocytochromes and haem domains of P450 BM3. Crystal structures of the mutant haem domains demonstrate axial ligation of P450 haem iron by methionine and glutamine ligands trans to the cysteine thiolate, creating novel haem iron ligand sets in the A264M/Q variants. In contrast, the crystal structure of the A264C variant reveals no direct interaction between the introduced cysteine side chain and the haem, although EPR data indicate Cys(264) interactions with haem iron in solution.

The immediate precursor of L-ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG). This is commonly produced commercially by Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium, using corn steep liquor powder (CSLP) as an organic nitrogen source. In this study, the effects of the individual CSLP components (amino acids, vitamins, and metal elements) on 2-KLG production were evaluated, with the aim of developing a complete, chemically defined medium for 2-KLG production. Forty components of CSLP were analyzed, and key components were correlated to biomass, 2-KLG productivity, and consumption rate of L-sorbose. Glycine had the greatest effect, followed by serine, biotin, proline, nicotinic acid, and threonine. The combination of 0.28 g L(-1) serine, 0.36 g L(-1) glycine, 0.18 g L(-1) threonine, 0.28 g L(-1) proline, 0.19 g L(-1) nicotinic acid, and 0.62 mg L(-1)biotin in a chemically defined medium produced the highest maximum biomass concentration (4.2 .. 10(9) cfu mL(-1)), 2-KL	2011	6	24	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Biomass; Biotin; Culture Media; Glycine; Niacin; Proline; Rhodobacteraceae; Serine; Sorbose; Sugar Acids; Threonine; Zea mays	Zhang	Jing

One hundred and thirty two Bacillus cereus and 52 Bacillus megaterium isolates from honeys were evaluated for the presence of genes encoding enterotoxin HBL, enterotoxin-T, cytotoxin K and the NHE complex, respectively. The relationship between hemolytic and coagulase activity and its correlation with the presence of the four mentioned enterotoxins was determined by principal component analysis (PCA). PCA in B. cereus revealed a positive correlation among free coagulase, hemolysis and the presence of genes hblA, hblB, hblC, hblD (HBL complex) and bceT (enterotoxin-T), but no correlation with the clumping factor (bound coagulase) and the presence of sequences of the NHE complex. On the other hand, PCA in B. megaterium showed a high positive correlation between coagulase (bound and free) and the haemolytic activity but no correlation in relation to the presence of genes of the HBL complex, cytotoxin K, enterotoxin T and the NHE complex.

21174469	10.1021/es1030905	Identification of key constituents and structure of the extracellular polymeric substances excreted by Bacillus megaterium TF10 for their flocculation capacity.	Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), a complex high-molecular-weight mixture of polymers excreted by microorganisms and produced from cell lysis, may have a high bioflocculation activity. In this work, the EPS excreted from Bacillus megaterium TF10, which was isolated from a soil sample, were systematically characterized to give insights into the relationship between their specific constituents and structure with their flocculation capacity. The results of microscopic observation, zeta potential, and TF10 EPS structure analysis show that the bridging mechanism was mainly responsible for the flocculation of the TF10.

An efficient 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA)-mineralizing bacterium has been isolated from enrichment cultures originating from a soil sample with a history of repeated exposure to diuron, a major metabolite of which is 3,4-DCA. This bacterium, Bacillus megaterium IMT21, also mineralized 2,3-, 2,4-, 2,5- and 3,5-DCA as sole sources of carbon and energy. These five DCA isomers were degraded via two different routes. 2,3-, 2,4- and 2,5-DCA were degraded via previously unknown dichloroaminophenol metabolites, whereas 3,4- and 3,5-DCA were degraded via dichloroacetanilide.	2011	6	17	Microbiology (Reading)	Microbiology (Reading, England)	Aniline Compounds; Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Culture Media; Diuron; Genes, rRNA; Herbicides; Isomerism; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology	Yao	Xie-Feng

The effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on the rooting and root growth of semi-hardwood and hardwood kiwifruit stem cuttings were investigated. The PGPR used were Bacillus RC23, Paenibacillus polymyxa RC05, Bacillus subtilis OSU142, Bacillus RC03, Comamonas acidovorans RC41, Bacillus megaterium RC01 and Bacillus simplex RC19. All the bacteria showed indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) producing capacity. Among the PGPR used, the highest rooting ratios were obtained at 47.50% for semi-hardwood stem cuttings from Bacillus RC03 and Bacillus simplex RC19 treatments and 42.50% for hardwood stem cuttings from Bacillus RC03. As well, Comamonas acidovorans RC41 inoculations indicated higher value than control treatments. The results suggest that these PGPR can be used in organic nursery material production and point to the feasibility of synthetic auxin (IBA) replacement by organic management based on PGPR.	2011	8	18	Biol Res	Biological research	Actinidia; Bacillus; Delftia acidovorans; Indoleacetic Acids; Paenibacillus; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Roots; Plant Stems	Erturk	Yasar
21141117		[Enhancement of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid production using three-stage pH control strategy].	The aim of this study was to improve the 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) production efficiency by Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium by using multi-stage pH control strategy. The effect of pH on the cell growths and 2-KLG production showed that the optimum pH for K. vulgare and B. megaterium cell growth were 6.0 and 8.0, respectively, while the optimum pH for 2-KLG production was 7.0. Based on the above results, we developed a three-stage pH control strategy: the pH was kept at 8.0 during the first 8 h, then decreased to 6.0 for the following 12 h, and maintained at 7.0 to the end of fermentation. With this strategy, the titer, productivity of 2-KLG and L-sorbose consumption rate were achieved at 77.3 g/L, 1.38 g/(L x h) and 1.42 g/(L x h), respectively, which were 9.7%, 33.2% and 25.7% higher than the corresponding values of the single pH (pH 7.0) control model.	2011	12	5	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Culture Media; Fermentation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Rhodobacteraceae; Sorbose; Sugar Acids	Zhang	Jing

21110374	10.1002/cbic.201000421	Structural basis for the properties of two single-site proline mutants of CYP102A1 (P450BM3).	The crystal structures of the haem domains of Ala330Pro and Ile401Pro, two single-site proline variants of CYP102A1 (P450(BM3)) from Bacillus megaterium, have been solved. In the A330P structure, the active site is constricted by the relocation of the Pro329 side chain into the substrate access channel, providing a basis for the distinctive C-H bond oxidation profiles given by the variant and the enhanced activity with small molecules. I401P, which is exceptionally active towards non-natural substrates, displays a number of structural similarities to substrate-bound forms of the wild-type enzyme, notably an off-axial water ligand, a drop in the proximal loop, and the positioning of two I-helix residues, Gly265 and His266, the reorientation of which prevents the formation of several intrahelical hydrogen bonds. Second-generation I401P variants gave high in vitro oxidation rates with non-natural substrates as varied as fluorene and propane, towards which the wild-type enzyme is essential	2011	3	31	Chembiochem	Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Proline; Protein Conformation; Substrate Specificity	Whitehouse	Christopher J C

The molecular diversity of aerobic endospore-forming bacteria, typically Bacillus and its derived genera, has been investigated in various environments. However, there have been few investigations concerning Bacillus in acidic soils. In this study, the genotypic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacilli isolated from the rice rhizosphere growing in acidic soils of Kerala (pH varying from 6.3 to 6.8) were investigated. For assessing their biocontrol potential and PGP attributes, 115 isolates were randomly selected and 49 isolates that were positive for multiple traits were selected. Metabolic characterization of representative strains, using the Biolog GP2 (Gram Positive) MicroPlate(TM) , revealed a large versatility with respect to carbohydrate utilization.

Urease and carbonic anhydrase (CA) are key enzymes in the chemical reaction of living organisms and have been found to be associated with calcification in a number of microorganisms and invertebrates. Three bacterial strains designated as AP4, AP6, and AP9 were isolated from highly alkaline soil samples using the enrichment culture technique. On the basis of various physiological tests and 16S rRNA sequence analysis, these three bacteria were identified as Bacillus sp., B. megaterium, and B. simplex. Further, these Bacillus species have been characterized for the production of urease and CA in the process of biocalcification. One of the isolates, AP6 produced 553 U/ml of urease and 5.61 EU/ml CA. All the strains were able to produce significant amount of exopolymeric substances and biofilm. Further, efficacy of these strains was tested for calcite production ability and results were correlated with urease and CA. Isolate AP6 precipitated 2.26 mg calcite/cell dry mass (mg).

Endophytic bacteria have been found in virtually every plant studied, where they colonize the internal tissues of their host plant and can form a range of different beneficial relationships. The diversity of bacterial endophytes associated with ginseng plants of varying age levels in Korea was investigated. Fifty-one colonies were isolated from the interior of ginseng stems. Although a mixed composition of endophyte communities was recovered from ginseng based on the results of 16S rDNA analysis, bacteria of the genus Bacillus and Staphylococcus dominated in 1-year-old and 4-year-old plants, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clusters: Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, ..-Proteobacteria, and ..-Proteobacteria, with Firmicutes being predominant. To evaluate the plant growth promoting activities, 18 representative isolates were selected. Amplification of nifH gene confirmed the presence of diazotrophy in only two isolates.

21040728	10.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.048	First structures of an active bacterial tyrosinase reveal copper plasticity.	Tyrosinase is a member of the type 3 copper enzyme family that is involved in the production of melanin in a wide range of organisms. The crystal structures of a tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium were determined at a resolution of 2.0-2.3..... The enzyme crystallized as a dimer in the asymmetric unit and was shown to be active in crystal. The overall monomeric structure is similar to that of the monomer of the previously determined tyrosinase from Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus, but it does not contain an accessory Cu-binding "caddie" protein. Two Cu(II) ions, serving as the major cofactors within the active site, are coordinated by six conserved histidine residues. However, determination of structures under different conditions shows varying occupancies and positions of the copper ions. This apparent mobility in copper binding modes indicates that there is a pathway by which copper is accumulated or lost by the enzyme.

20962060	10.1124/dmd.110.036392	Generation of human chiral metabolites of simvastatin and lovastatin by bacterial CYP102A1 mutants.	Recently, the wild-type and mutant forms of cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium were found to oxidize various xenobiotic substrates, including pharmaceuticals, of human P450 enzymes. Simvastatin and lovastatin, which are used to treat hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia, are oxidized by human CYP3A4/5 to produce several metabolites, including 6'..-hydroxy (OH), 3...-OH, and exomethylene products. In this report, we show that the oxidation of simvastatin and lovastatin was catalyzed by wild-type CYP102A1 and a set of its mutants, which were generated by site-directed and random mutagenesis. One major hydroxylated product (6'..-OH) and one minor product (6'-exomethylene), but not other products, were produced by CYP102A1 mutants. Formation of the metabolites was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and NMR. Chemical methods to synthesize the metabolites of simvastatin and lovastatin have not been reported.

Bacillus anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax, is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod, with colonies exhibiting a unique ground-glass appearance, and lacking hemolysis and motility. In addition to these phenotypes, several others traits are characteristic of B. anthracis such as susceptibility to gamma phage, the presence of two virulence plasmids (pX01 and pX02), and specific cell wall and capsular antigens that are commonly detected by direct fluorescent-antibody assays. We report on the identification and characterization of 14 Bacillus megaterium and four Bacillus sp. clinical isolates that are nonhemolytic, nonmotile, and produce a capsule antigenically similar to B. anthracis. This work furthers our understanding of Bacillus diversity and the limitations of the assays and phenotypes that are used to differentiate species in this genus. Further work is necessary to understand whether these strains are opportunistic pathogens or just contaminates.	2011	4	4	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Antigenic Variation; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacillus; Bacillus anthracis; Bacterial Capsules; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S	Beesley	Cari A

Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 (BM3) is a P450/P450 reductase fusion enzyme, where the dimer is considered the active form in NADPH-dependent fatty acid hydroxylation. The BM3 W1046A mutant was generated, removing an aromatic "shield" from its FAD isoalloxazine ring. W1046A BM3 is a catalytically active NADH-dependent lauric acid hydroxylase, with product formation slightly superior to the NADPH-driven enzyme. The W1046A BM3 K(m) for NADH is 20-fold lower than wild-type BM3, and catalytic efficiency of W1046A BM3 with NADH and NADPH are similar in lauric acid oxidation. Wild-type BM3 also catalyzes NADH-dependent lauric acid hydroxylation, but less efficiently than W1046A BM3. A hypothesis that W1046A BM3 is inactive [15] helped underpin a model of electron transfer from FAD in one BM3 monomer to FMN in the other in order to drive fatty acid hydroxylation in native BM3. Our data showing W1046A BM3 is a functional fatty acid hydroxylase are consistent instead with a BM3 catalytic model in	2011	4	21	Arch Biochem Biophys	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Fatty Acids; Flavin Mononucleotide; Heme; Hydroxylation; Mutation; NAD; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Protein Multimerization	Girvan	Hazel M

Here a chimeric model system consisting of human cytochrome P450 3A4 and the soluble reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BMR) is used to study the relationship between electron transfer and the coupling efficiency in substrate monoxygenation. Several regulatory features were considered. FAD and FMN added to apoenzyme in oversaturating concentrations influence neither formaldehyde production nor coupling efficiency. The optimal conditions of coupling efficiency depended only on the NADPH concentration. The pH (8.0) and ionic strength (50..mM potassium phosphate) were found to modulate the level of coupling, indicating an influence over the formation of a productive interaction between the BMR and the haem domain.

B. megaterium sleB cwlJ double mutant strains complemented with engineered SleB variants in which the predicted N- or C-terminal domain has been deleted (SleB-..N or SleB-..C) efficiently initiate and hydrolyze the cortex, generating anhydromuropeptides in the process. Additionally, sleB cwlJ strains complemented with SleB-..N or SleB-..C, in which glutamate and aspartate residues have individually been changed to alanine, all retain the ability to hydrolyze the cortex to various degrees during germination, with concomitant release of anhydromuropeptides to the surrounding medium.

20725723	10.1007/s00253-010-2836-4	Biocatalytic synthesis of (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ethyl ester using a recombinant whole-cell catalyst.	A cofactor regeneration system for enzymatic biosynthesis was constructed by coexpressing a carbonyl reductase from Pichia stipitis and a glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) PlySs. Transformants containing the polycistronic plasmid pET-PII-SD2-AS1-B exhibited an activity of 13.5 U/mg protein with 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate ethyl ester (COBE) as the substrate and an activity of 14.4 U/mg protein with glucose as the substrate; NAD(H) was the coenzyme in both cases. Asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ethyl ester [(S)-CHBE] with more than 99% enantiomeric excess was demonstrated by transformants. Furthermore, the paper made a comparison of crude enzyme catalysis and whole-cell catalysis in an aqueous monophasic system and a water/organic solvent biphasic system. In the water/n-butyl acetate system, the coexpression system produced 1,398 mM CHBE in the organic phase, which is the highest yield ever reported for CHBE prod	2011	2	25	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Bacillus megaterium; Biotechnology; Butyrates; Escherichia coli; Glucose Dehydrogenases; Pichia; Plasmids; Recombinant Proteins; Transformation, Genetic	Ye	Qi
20695504	10.1021/bi100729m	Cell-selective lysis by novel analogues of melittin against human red blood cells and Escherichia coli.	Melittin is a good model antimicrobial peptide to understand the basis of its lytic activities against bacteria and mammalian cells. Novel analogues of melittin were designed by substituting the leucine residue(s) at the "d" and "a" positions of its previously identified leucine zipper motif. A scrambled peptide having the same composition of melittin with altered leucine zipper sequence was also designed. The analogues of melittin including the scrambled peptide showed a drastic reduction in cytotoxicity though they exhibited comparable bactericidal activities. Only melittin but not its analogues localized strongly onto hRBCs and formed pores of approximately 2.2-3.4 nm. However, melittin and its analogues localized similarly onto Escherichia coli and formed pores of varying sizes as tested onto Bacillus megaterium. The data showed that the substitution of hydrophobic leucine residue(s) by lesser hydrophobic alanine residue(s) in the leucine zipper sequence of melittin disturbed its p	2010	11	3	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Amino Acid Sequence; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cell Membrane; Erythrocytes; Escherichia coli; Hemolysis; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Leucine Zippers; Melitten; Microscopy, Confocal; Molecular Sequence Data	Pandey	Brijesh K

The effect of the concentration of metal ions in minimal media has been shown to be very important for the production and secretion of the antibody fragment D1.3 scFv in Bacillus megaterium YYBm1. The best media compositions for biomass and antibody fragment formation were evaluated using a genetic algorithm. The screening was carried out in 96 microtiter deep well plates with 900 ..L cultivation volume. In 7 generations, 240 different kinds of media were tested, key elements for production and secretion were detected and a 117% increase in production of antibody fragment compared to the previously used medium could be achieved. In addition, media with a higher biomass formation (+84%) or with both more biomass and a higher production of antibody fragment (Pareto-front members) were found. Interestingly the best media for protein production and secretion were different in their composition, with regards to the metal ion concentration levels.

Abstract: Recently, silver nanoparticles have generated enough interest due to their immense usage. Until now chemical synthesis has been a fast method to produce nanoparticles, but the release of environmental pollutants has raised caution. So a more subtle biochemical approach is in research. Three microorganisms, Aspergillus flavus, Phoma exigua and Bacillus megaterium, were selected to reduce silver nitrate to silver nanoparticles in aqueous form. All three microorganisms showed varying reducing capacity, of which Phoma exigua showed the highest, when their biomass was incubated in silver nitrate for 48 hours. The nanoparticles showed all the optical and physical properties, which were analyzed by measuring the surface plasmon resonance and TEM. It was also observed that the fungal species have varied growth in silver nitrate and can be used to produce silver nanoparticles, directly incubating the inocula of fungus in the media containing silver nitrate.

20669184	10.1002/pro.468	Determination of the X-ray structure of the snake venom protein omwaprin by total chemical synthesis and racemic protein crystallography.	The 50-residue snake venom protein L-omwaprin and its enantiomer D-omwaprin were prepared by total chemical synthesis. Radial diffusion assays were performed against Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus anthracis; both L- and D-omwaprin showed antibacterial activity against B. megaterium. The native protein enantiomer, made of L-amino acids, failed to crystallize readily. However, when a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of L- and D-omwaprin was used, diffraction quality crystals were obtained. The racemic protein sample crystallized in the centrosymmetric space group P2(1)/c and its structure was determined at atomic resolution (1.33 A) by a combination of Patterson and direct methods based on the strong scattering from the sulfur atoms in the eight cysteine residues per protein. Racemic crystallography once again proved to be a valuable method for obtaining crystals of recalcitrant proteins and for determining high-resolution X-ray structures by direct methods.	2011	1	27	Protein Sci	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society	Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Bacillus megaterium; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Circular Dichroism; Crystallography, X-Ray; Elapid Venoms; Mass Spectrometry; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Conformation; Stereoisomerism	Banigan	James R

The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Wuyiencin fractions with different polarities against six indicator microorganisms: Rhodotorula rubra, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli, Cladosporium fulvum and Staphylococcus aureus. The fermentation broth of Wuyiencin was submitted to AB-8 macroporous adsorptive resin and fractionated with solvents of different polarity. The fraction eluted with water had remarkably antimicrobial activity against all the microorganisms investigated except for C. fulvum and S. aureus (MIC &lt;or= 0.0625 mg/mL), probably due to the presence of active components. The fraction eluted with methanol showed potential antimicrobial activity against all the test microorganisms except for R.rubra, with MIC values of 0.5 and 2 mg/mL. In conclusion, fractions eluted with water and methanol, respectively, represent the main active-part of Wuyiencin, and could be emphasized for agricultural applications in the future.	2010	11	3	Molecules	Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	Anti-Infective Agents; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Chemical Fractionation; Cladosporium; Escherichia coli; Fermentation; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Rhodotorula; Staphylococcus aureus	Cui	Zengjie

Effect of various nutritional components and fermentation parameters on biotransformation of colchicine using Bacillus megaterium ACBT03 to produce 3-demethylated colchicine (3-DMC) has been investigated. Initially, Plackett-Burman (PB) design was used to evaluate the 11 nutritional variables to screen medium component that significantly influences the 3-demethylated colchicine (3-DMC) production. Three most statistically significant nutrients that is starch, glycerol and yeast extract were identified. Response surface methodology was used to optimize fermenter operational factors pH, temperature, impeller tip velocity and aeration rate for high 3-DMC production. The predicted results of 3-DMC yield (7689.13mg/l) were obtained at 5-l-jar fermenter after optimization of pH 6.8, temperature 28..C, impeller tip velocity 4650cm/min, and aeration rate 2.0vvm.

20638423	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.07.014	Development of a flow-through microscopic multitesting system for parallel monitoring of cell samples in biotechnological cultivation processes.	The automated monitoring of cell variables in cultivation processes is a key technology in modern bioscience. In this article an innovative analytical tool for monitoring of cell densities in shaking-flask cultivations--consisting of a flow-through microscope with an automated image analysis software integrated in a FIA sampling system--is presented. This atline multitesting system was optimized by varying the height of the microscopes sampling zone. A calibration of the system was performed by correlating the FIA result peaks to known concentrations of Baker's yeast. It was successfully applied in cell density monitoring of cultivation processes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a good correlation with offline methods, and further used to monitor 3 parallel cultivations. This methodology was successfully transferred to Bacillus megaterium cultures and applied to measure the cell densities of parallel cultivation setups of B. megaterium and S. cerevisiae.	2011	2	8	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Algorithms; Bacillus megaterium; Biomass; Bioreactors; Equipment Design; Flow Injection Analysis; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Microbiological Techniques; Microscopy; Saccharomyces cerevisiae	Rehbock	Christoph

The fire affected various physico-chemical properties of the soil. Significant differences in pH and electrical conductivity were recorded in soil of fired and fallow plots. Significantly higher amounts of total organic carbon and nitrogen were estimated in fallow plots as compared to the fired. Difference in total phosphates was not significant. The fire operations resulted in stimulation of microbial communities. The bacteria were the most affected group followed by actinomycetes and fungi, respectively. The bacterial and actinomycetes counts were significantly higher in fired plots as compared to the fallow plots. The representative bacterial species recovered from the 'fired plots' belonged to the genus Bacillus and Pseudomonas. 16S rRNA analysis revealed their maximum similarity with B. clausii, B. licheni	2011	3	15	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Agriculture; Bacteria; Carbon; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Electric Conductivity; Fires; Fungi; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; India; Nitrogen; Phosphates; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil; Soil Microbiology	Pandey	Anita

Gene "7" of Escherichia coli phage K1E was proposed to encode a novel DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP). The corresponding protein was produced recombinantly, purified to apparent homogeneity via affinity chromatography, and successfully employed for in vitro RNA synthesis. Optimal assay conditions (pH 8, 37 degrees C, 10 mM magnesium chloride and 1.3 mM spermidine) were established. The corresponding promoter regions were identified on the phage genome and summarized in a sequence logo. Surprisingly, next to K1E promoters, the SP6 promoter was also recognized efficiently in vitro by K1E RNAP, while the T7 RNAP promoter was not recognized at all. Based on these results, a system for high-yield in vitro RNA synthesis using K1E RNAP was established. The template plasmid is a pUC18 derivative, which enables blue/white screening for positive cloning of the target DNA. Production of more than 5 microg of purified RNA per microgram plasmid DNA was achieved.

The molecular basis for the recognition of glucose as a germinant molecule by spores of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 has been examined. A chromosome-located locus (BMQ_1820, renamed gerWB) is shown to encode a receptor B-protein subunit that interacts with the GerUA and GerUC proteins to form a receptor that is cognate for both glucose and leucine. GerWB represents the third receptor B protein that binds to glucose in this strain. Site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) experiments conducted on charged proline and aromatic residues predicted to reside in the transmembrane domains of a previously characterized receptor B protein, GerVB, reveal the importance to receptor function of a cluster of residues predicted to reside in the middle of the transmembrane 6 (TM6) domain. Reductions in the region of 70- to 165-fold in the apparent affinity of receptors for glucose in which Glu196, Tyr191, and Phe192 are individually replaced by SDM indicate that some or all of these residues may be directly in	2010	9	13	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Bacillus megaterium; Chromosomes, Bacterial; Glucose; Leucine; Ligands; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Spores, Bacterial	Christie	Graham

Organomercury lyase (MerB) is a key enzyme in bacterial detoxification and bioremediation of organomercurials. However, the merB gene is often considered as an ancillary component of the mer operon because there is zero to three merB genes in different mer operons identified so far. In this study, organomercurials' removal abilities of native mercury-resistant bacteria that have one or multiple merB genes were examined. Each heterogeneous merB genes from these bacteria was further cloned into Escherichia coli to investigate the substrate specificity of each MerB enzyme. The merB1 gene from Bacillus megaterium MB1 conferred the highest volatilization ability to methylmercury chloride, ethylmercury chloride, thimerosal and p-chloromercuribenzoate, while the merB3 from B. megaterium MB1 conferred the fastest mercury volatilization activity to p-chloromercuribenzoate.

A 409 bp full length defensin gene was cloned and sequenced based on an expressed sequence tag (EST) obtained from a normalized zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) foot cDNA library developed in our laboratory. The D. polymorpha defensin (Dpd) gene encoded a peptide with 76 amino acid residues. The mature Dpd contains 54 amino acids with a fully functional insect defensin A domain. Homologue searching against GenBank database suggested that this Dpd was phylogenetically close to defensins from a group of insects with six conserved cysteine residues. Predicted with homology-modeling method, the three-dimensional structure of Dpd also demonstrated a significant similarity with insect defensin A. The recombinant Dpd was in vitro expressed through an Escherichia coli expression system.

TCBPA biodegradation rate constants (k(1)) and half-lives (t(1/2)) ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 day(-1) and 11.6 to 23.1 days, respectively. The biodegradation of TCBPA was enhanced by the addition of cellulose, yeast extract, sodium chloride, brij 30, brij 35, surfactin, and rhamnolipid. Of the micro-organism strains isolated from the sediment, we found that strains L1 and L5 (identified as Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas putida) expressed the best biodegrading ability.

It is documented that some plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) enhance plant salt tolerance. However, as to how PGPR may influence two crucial components of plant salt tolerance such as, root hydraulic characteristics and aquaporin regulation has been almost unexplored. Here, maize (Zea mays L.) plants were inoculated with a Bacillus megaterium strain previously isolated from a degraded soil and characterized as PGPR. Inoculated plants were found to exhibit higher root hydraulic conductance (L) values under both unstressed and salt-stressed conditions. These higher L values in inoculated plants correlated with higher plasma membrane type two (PIP2) aquaporin amount in their roots under salt-stressed conditions. Also, ZmPIP1;1 protein amount under salt-stressed conditions was higher in inoculated leaves than in non-inoculated ones. Hence, the different regulation of PIP aquaporin expression and abundance by the inoculation with the B. megaterium strain could be one of the causes	2010	9	9	Planta	Planta	Aquaporins; Bacillus megaterium; Cell Membrane; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Sodium Chloride; Zea mays	Marulanda	Adriana

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are involved in the synthesis of a wide variety of valuable products and in the degradation of numerous toxic compounds. The P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium was the first P450 discovered to be fused to its redox partner, a mammalian-like diflavin reductase.

20463018	10.1074/jbc.M110.109017	Human cytochrome P450 2E1 structures with fatty acid analogs reveal a previously unobserved binding mode.	Human microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 is widely known for its ability to oxidize &gt;70 different, mostly compact, low molecular weight drugs and other xenobiotic compounds. In addition CYP2E1 oxidizes much larger C9-C20 fatty acids that can serve as endogenous signaling molecules. Previously structures of CYP2E1 with small molecules revealed a small, compact CYP2E1 active site, which would be insufficient to accommodate medium and long chain fatty acids without conformational changes in the protein. In the current work we have determined how CYP2E1 can accommodate a series of fatty acid analogs by cocrystallizing CYP2E1 with omega-imidazolyl-octanoic fatty acid, omega-imidazolyl-decanoic fatty acid, and omega-imidazolyl-dodecanoic fatty acid. In each structure direct coordination of the imidazole nitrogen to the heme iron mimics the position required for native fatty acid substrates to yield the omega-1 hydroxylated metabolites that predominate experimentally.

Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are pattern recognition molecules of the innate immune system that recognize peptidoglycan, a unique bacterial cell wall component. Here we cloned and characterized PGRP-S from the bumblebee Bombus ignitus (BiPGRP-S). The BiPGRP-S gene consists of four exons that encode 194 amino acid residues. Comparative analysis indicates that the predicted amino acid sequence of BiPGRP-S shares a high identity with enzymatically active PGRP-S proteins and contains the amino acids required for amidase activity. BiPGRP-S in B. ignitus worker bees is constitutively expressed in both the fat body and epidermis, and it is secreted into the hemolymph. Quantitative real-time PCR assays revealed that the BiPGRP-S gene is highly induced in both the fat body and the epidermis after an injection of Bacillus thuringiensis. In addition, recombinant BiPGRP-S expressed as a 19-kDa protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells can bind to Bacillus megaterium and B. thuring	2011	2	2	Dev Comp Immunol	Developmental and comparative immunology	Amidohydrolases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacillus thuringiensis; Bees; Carrier Proteins; Cells, Cultured; Cloning, Molecular; Epidermis; Fat Body; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections; Hemolymph; Immunity, Innate; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Structure, Tertiary; RNA, Small Interfering	You	Hong

The Bacillus megaterium protein production system based on the inducible promoter of the xyl operon (P(xylA)) was systematically optimized. Multiple changes in basic promoter elements, such as the -10 and -35 region and the ribosome-binding site, resulted in an 18-fold increase of protein production compared to the production of the previously established system. The production in shaking-flask culture of green fluorescent protein (Gfp) as a model product led to 82.5 mg per g cell dry weight (g(CDW)) or 124 mg liter(-1). In fed-batch cultivation, the volumetric protein yield was increased 10-fold to 1.25 g liter(-1), corresponding to 36.8 mg protein per g(CDW). Furthermore, novel signal peptides for Sec-dependent protein secretion were predicted in silico using the B. megaterium genome.

Although the importance of peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) in detecting bacteria and promoting immunity is well recognized in Drosophila melanogaster and other insect species, such a role has not yet been experimentally established for PGRPs in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. In this study, we purified M. sexta PGRP1 from the baculovirus-insect cell expression system, tested its association with peptidoglycans and intact bacteria, and explored its possible link with the prophenoloxidase activation system in larval hemolymph. Sequence comparison suggested that PGRP1 is not an amidase and lacks residues for interacting with the carboxyl group of meso-diaminopimelic acid-peptidoglycans (DAP-PGs). M. sexta PGRP1 gene was constitutively expressed at a low level in fat body, and the mRNA concentration became much higher after an injection of Escherichia coli.

Raman spectra of Gram-positive and Gram-negative plant bacteria have been measured with micro-Raman spectrometers equipped with 785 and 514.5 nm lasers. The Gram-positive bacteria Microbacterium testaceum, Paenibacillus validus, and Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis have strong carotenoid bands in the regions 1155-1157 cm(-1) and 1516-1522 cm(-1) that differentiate them from other tested Gram-negative bacteria. In the Raman spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus megaterium excited with 785 nm laser, the Raman bands at 1157 and 1521 cm(-1) are weak in intensity compared to other Gram-positive bacteria, and these bands did not show significant resonance Raman enhancement in the spectrum recorded with 514.5 nm laser excitation. The Gram-positive bacteria could be separated from each other based on the bands associated with the in-phase C=C (v(1)) vibrations of the polyene chain of carotenoids. None of the Gram-negative bacteria tested had carotenoid bands.

Biocatalysis of ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (COBE) to ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate [(S)-CHBE] was carried out using Escherichia coli co-expressing a carbonyl reductase gene from Pichia stipitis and a glucose dehydrogenase gene from Bacillus megaterium. An efficient polycistronic plasmid with a high-level of enzyme co-expression was constructed by changing the order of the genes, altering the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) regions, and aligned spacing (AS) between the SD sequence and the translation initiation codon. The optimal SD sequence was 5-TAAGGAGG-3, and the optimal AS distance was eight nucleotides. Asymmetric reduction of COBE to (S)-CHBE with more than 99% enantiomeric excess was demonstrated by transformants, using a water/ethyl caprylate system. The recombinant cells produced 1260 mM product in the organic phase, and the total turnover number, defined as moles (S)-CHBE formed per mole NADP(+), was 12,600, which was more than 10-fold higher than in aqueous systems.	2010	8	23	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Bacillus; Base Sequence; Biocatalysis; Butyrates; DNA Primers; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzyme Stability; Glucose 1-Dehydrogenase; Pichia; Plasmids	Ye	Qi

We screened a strain NK13 for a certain extent asymmetric hydrolysis the rac-ketoprofen Chloroethyl ester to (S)-Ketoprofen. As identified, NK13 was Bacillus megaterium. Digested NK13 genomic DNA with Sau3AI partially and recovered the fragment from 2 kb to 6 kb, cleaved the plasmid of pUC18 with BamH I, ligated the 2-6 kb fragment of NK13 genomic DNA into pUC18 plasmid, and then transformed an Escherichia coli strain DH5alpha. We created the gene library of NK13 and obtained a positive clone, pUC-NK1 in the library from the tributyrin flat. The result of sequencing showed that there was a whole open read frame (ORF) of 633 bp lipase gene in the plasmid of pUC-NK1. To compare with the genes of GenBank, this lipase gene was reported firstly (GenBank Accession No. EU381317).

To determine the mechanism of wet heat killing of spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium. Bacillus cereus and B. megaterium spores wet heat-killed 82-99% gave two bands on equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. The lighter band was absent from spores that were not heat-treated and increased in intensity upon increased heating times. These spores lacked dipicolinic acid (DPA) were not viable, germinated minimally and had much denatured protein. The spores in the denser band had viabilities as low as 2% of starting spores but retained normal DPA levels and most germinated, albeit slowly. However, these largely dead spores outgrew poorly if at all and synthesized little or no ATP following germination. Wet heat treatment appears to kill spores of B. cereus and B. megaterium by denaturing one or more key proteins, as has been suggested for wet heat killing of Bacillus subtilis spores.

We provide a simple but very efficient transconjugation protocol for Bacillus megaterium. By combining utile attributes of known transconjugation methods (small size of the transferred DNA, close physical contact between donor and recipient cells, and heat treatment of the latter) and by determining the appropriate donor/recipient ratio, mating approaches yielded 5 x 10(-5) transconjugants/recipient. Counter-selection for eliminating Escherichia coli donor cells from the mating mixture was possible by pasteurization in case a wild type sporulation proficient B. megaterium served as the mating partner. For nonsporulating mutants, the sacB gene from Bacillus subtilis coding for levansucrase was successfully employed to select against the E. coli donor. The transfer efficiency, up to 15,000 transconjugants acquirable in a single experiment, sufficed--for the first time in this species--to directly select a gene (uvrA) knockout in a one-step procedure.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are of outstanding interest for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, due to their ability to hydroxylate C--H bonds mainly in a stereo- and regioselective manner. CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368, one of only a few known bacterial steroid hydroxylases, enables the oxidation of 3-keto-4-ene steroids mainly at position 15. We expressed this enzyme together with the electron-transfer partners bovine adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase in Escherichia coli. Additionally an enzyme-coupled cofactor regeneration system was implemented by expressing alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis. By studying the conversion of progesterone and testosterone, the bottlenecks of these P450-catalyzed hydroxylations were identified. Substrate transport into the cell and substrate solubility turned out to be crucial for the overall performance.

Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) is a biotechnologically important cytochrome P450/P450 reductase fusion enzyme. Mutants I401E, F261E and L86E were engineered near the haem 5-methyl group, to explore the ability of the glutamate carboxylates to form ester linkages with the methyl group, as observed for eukaryotic CYP4 relatives. Although no covalent linkage was detected, mutants displayed marked alterations in substrate/inhibitor affinity, with L86E and I401E mutants having lower Kd values for arachidonic acid and dodecanoic (lauric) acid than WT (wild-type) BM3. All mutations induced positive shifts in haem Fe(III)/Fe(II) potential, with substrate-free I401E (-219 mV) being &gt;170 mV more positive than WT BM3. The elevated potential stimulated FMN-to-haem electron transfer ~2-fold (to 473 s-1) in I401E, and resulted in stabilization of Fe(II)O2 complexes in the I401E and L86E P450s.

Successful industrial use of amylases requires that they are sufficiently stable and active at application conditions, e.g., at high temperature in starch-liquefaction process. In the present study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to enhance the thermal stability and calcium independency of a mesophilic alpha-amylase from Bacillus megaterium WHO. Mutations (A53S and H58I) were designed at the calcium-binding site based on the sequence alignment. Kinetic and thermostability parameters of the mutants were analyzed and compared with that of the wild type. In the presence of calcium, the affinity of the enzymes (wild type and mutants) toward starch was increased. In comparison to the wild type, calcium ion had more effect on the catalytic efficiency, k (cat)/K (m), and half-life (at 60 degrees C) of A53S mutant. In A53S, the dependence of half-life on calcium concentration showed that the enhanced calcium binding is likely to be responsible for the increased stability.

A strain of marine Bacillus megaterium isolated from the Yellow Sea of East China was evaluated for its activity in reducing postharvest decay of peanut kernels caused by Aspergillus flavus in in vitro and in vivo tests. The results showed that the concentrations of antagonist had a significant effect on biocontrol effectiveness in vivo: when the concentration of the washed bacteria cell suspension was used at 1x10(9)CFU/ml, the percentage rate of rot of peanut kernels was 31.67%+/-2.89%, which was markedly lower than that treated with water (the control) after 7days of incubation at 28 degrees C. The results also showed that unwashed cell culture of B. megaterium was as effective as the washed cell suspension, and better biocontrol was obtained when longer incubation time of B. megaterium was applied. When the incubation time of B. megaterium was 60-h, the rate of decay declined to 41.67%+/-2.89%.

Gas chromatography in combination with electron ionization mass spectrometry (GC/EI-MS) was used to determine the fatty acids of a membrane lipid from Bacillus megaterium. Special attention was put on the structure and absolute configuration of a monoenoic fatty acid previously described in this sample. GC/EI-MS operated in the selected ion monitoring mode was used to determine twelve fatty acids in the bacterium. Methyl esters were prepared to verify the presence of a 14-methylhexadecenoic acid (a17:1) isomer. The position of the double bond of the a17:1 isomer and four further monoenoic fatty acids was elucidated by means of their picolinyl esters produced by the transesterification of the phospholipid. For the a17:1 isomer, the double bond was located between C-5 and C-6. Silver ion liquid chromatography was used to verify that the double bond was in cis-configuration.

Dual-trap laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy (LTRS) and elastic light scattering (ELS) were used to investigate dynamic processes during high-temperature treatment of individual spores of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus subtilis in water. Major conclusions from these studies included the following. (i) After spores of all three species were added to water at 80 to 90 degrees C, the level of the 1:1 complex of Ca(2+) and dipicolinic acid (CaDPA; approximately 25% of the dry weight of the spore core) in individual spores remained relatively constant during a highly variable lag time (T(lag)), and then CaDPA was released within 1 to 2 min. (ii) The T(lag) values prior to rapid CaDPA release and thus the times for wet-heat killing of individual spores of all three species were very heterogeneous. (iii) The heterogeneity in kinetics of wet-heat killing of individual spores was not due to differences in the microscopic physical environments during heat treatment.

Glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is a metabolic intermediate with many possible cellular fates. In mycobacteria, G6P is a substrate for an enzyme, F(420)-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fgd), found in few bacterial genera. Intracellular G6P levels in six Mycobacterium sp. were remarkably higher ( approximately 17-130-fold) than Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. The high G6P level in Mycobacterium smegmatis may result from 10-25-fold higher activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase when grown on glucose, glycerol, or acetate compared with B. megaterium and E. coli. In M. smegmatis this coincided with up-regulation of the first gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, when acetate was the carbon source, suggesting a cellular program for maintaining high G6P levels. G6P was depleted in cells under oxidative stress induced by redox cycling agents plumbagin and menadione, whereas an fgd mutant of M. smegmatis used G6P less well under such	2010	7	21	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Antioxidants; Bacillus megaterium; Cell Membrane; Escherichia coli; Genetic Complementation Test; Glucose-6-Phosphate; Models, Biological; Mutation; Mycobacterium; Naphthoquinones; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Riboflavin; Vitamin K 3	Hasan	Mohammad Rubayet

Bacillus spp. is widely used as the companion bacterium in the two-step biosynthesis of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG), which is the direct precursor in the production of vitamin C by Ketogulonigenium vulgare. To understand the effects of sporulation and spore stability on 2-KLG production, the spo0A and spoVFA deletion mutants of Bacillus megaterium were constructed. The sorbose conversion rates of spo0A and spoVFA mutant co-culture systems were 33% and 70% lower, respectively, than that of the wild-type co-culture system. In addition, K. vulgare cell numbers in the two mutant systems declined by 15% and 49%, respectively, compared to the value in the wild-type system. Correlation analysis indicated that the 2-KLG concentration is positively related to sorbose dehydrogenase activity and the K. vulgare cell number. This study demonstrated that sporulation and spore stability of the wild-type companion play key roles in the enhancement of K. vulgare propagation and 2-KLG biosynthesis.	2012	5	29	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Gene Deletion; Genes, Bacterial; Plasmids; Proteobacteria; Spores, Bacterial; Sugar Acids	Zhu	Yibo

We investigated the metabolism of glibenclamide and glimepiride, hypoglycemic drugs of sulfonylurea type, and determined corresponding in vitro kinetic parameters. The resulting 3-cyclohexyl-hydroxylation activity towards glibenclamide and glimepiride was demonstrated by NMR analysis. Furthermore, the main product of glibenclamide, cis-3-hydroxy-glibenclamide is identical with the phase-1-metabolite of this drug in human. The orientation of glimepiride and glibenclamide in the active site of the enzyme is shown by a computational docking model. For high scale production of sulfonylurea derivatives, we designed whole-cell biocatalysts based on Bacillus megaterium MS941.

22192513	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.12.004	Genetic engineering of Ketogulonigenium vulgare for enhanced production of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid.	Folate derivatives are crucial growth factors for Ketogulonigenium vulgare which is used in mixed culture with Bacillus megaterium for the industrial production of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KGA), the precursor of L-ascorbic acid (L-AA) or vitamin C (Vc). To improve the growth and 2-KGA production, five genes involved in folate biosynthesis identified in a folate gene cluster from Lactococcus lactis MG1363, including folB, folKE, folP, folQ and folC, were over-expressed in K. vulgare. Intracellular folate concentration in the recombinant strain harboring folate biosynthesis genes cluster under the control of P(sdh) (sorbose dehydrogenase gene sdh promoter from K. vulgare) was 8 times higher than that of the wildtype K. vulgare DSM 4025 (P&lt;0.001). In shake flask studies, the cell density and 2-KGA production of the recombinant K. vulgare Rif (pMCS2PsdhfolBC) were increased by 18% (P&lt;0.001) and 14% (P&lt;0.001), respectively, under a relatively stable pH 7 condition.

The growth inhibition of 12 native marine bacteria isolated from Aplysina sponge surfaces, the shell of a bivalve, and Phytagel immersed for 48 h in sea water were used as indicator of the antifouling activity of the extracts of 39 marine organisms (octocorals, sponges, algae, and zoanthid) collected in the Colombian Caribbean Sea and on the Brazilian coast (Santa Catarina). Gram-negative bacteria represented 75% of the isolates; identified strains belonged to Oceanobacillus iheyensis, Ochrobactrum pseudogrignonense, Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi, and Bacillus megaterium species and seven strains were classified at genus level by the 16S rRNA sequencing method. The extracts of the octocorals Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, four Eunicea octocorals, and the sponges Topsentia ophiraphidites, Agelas citrina, Neopetrosia carbonaria, Monanchora arbuscula, Cliona tenuis, Iotrochota imminuta, and Ptilocaulis walpersii were the most active, thus suggesting those species as antifoulant produc	2012	1	6	Z Naturforsch C J Biosci	Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung.

22180859	10.1039/c1dt11437a	Fluorescence detection of ligand binding to labeled cytochrome P450 BM3.	The cytochrome P450 superfamily of monoxygenases are highly relevant for pharmaceutical, environmental and biocatalytical applications. The binding of a substrate to their catalytic site is usually detectable by UV-vis spectroscopy as a low-to-high spin state transition of the heme iron. However, the discovery of potential new substrates is limited by the fact that some compounds do not cause the typical spin-shift even if they are oxidised by P450 enzymes. Here we report a fluorescence-based method able to detect the binding of such substrates to the heme domain of cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium. The protein was labeled with the fluorescent probe N,N'-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-Yl)-ethylenediamine (IANBD). Arachidonic and lauric acids are substrates of P450 BM3 and were used to validate the method, as their binding can be detected both by a spin-shift of the Soret peak from 419 to 397 nm and by the fluorescence change of the labelled prote	2012	5	31	Dalton Trans	Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)	Amides; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Fluorescent Dyes; Heme; Ligands; Models, Molecular; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxadiazoles; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Staining and Labeling	Ferrero	Valentina E V

Fibrinogen-related proteins play important roles in innate immunity. We isolated a fibrinogen-related protein gene (MjFREP1) in kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. MjFREP1 encoded a protein of 270 amino acids, including a 223 amino acid fibrinogen-like domain. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis shows that MjFREP1 is mainly expressed in the gills and the expression is significantly upregulated by Vibrio anguillarum, Staphylococcus aureus, or white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. Recombinant MjFREP1 fibrinogen-like domain agglutinates Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus megaterium, and S...aureus in the presence of calcium ions. The fibrinogen-like domain of MjFREP1 binds peptidoglycans, LPS, bacteria, and the VP28 of WSSV.

22139169	10.1107/S1744309111040462	Improved X-ray diffraction from Bacillus megaterium penicillin G acylase crystals through long cryosoaking dehydration.	Penicillin G acylase from Bacillus megaterium (BmPGA) is currently used in the pharmaceutical industry as an alternative to PGA from Escherichia coli (EcPGA) for the hydrolysis of penicillin G to produce 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA), a penam nucleus for semisynthetic penicillins. Despite the significant differences in amino-acid sequence between PGAs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, a representative PGA structure of Gram-positive origin has never been reported. In this study, crystallization and diffraction studies of BmPGA are described. Poor diffraction patterns with blurred spots at higher resolution were typical for BmPGA crystals cryocooled after a brief immersion in cryoprotectant solution. Overnight soaking in the same cryo-solution substantially improved both the mosaicity and resolution limit through the establishment of a new crystal-packing equilibrium.

In this study, the phlorotannin dieckol, which was isolated from the brown alga Ecklonia cava, was examined for its inhibitory effects on melanin synthesis. Tyrosinase inhibitors are important agents for cosmetic products. We therefore examined the inhibitory effects of dieckol on mushroom tyrosinase and melanin synthesis, and analyzed its binding modes using the crystal structure of Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase (PDB ID: 3NM8). Dieckol inhibited mushroom tyrosinase with an IC(50) of 20..M and was more effective as a cellular tyrosinase having melanin reducing activities than the commercial inhibitor, arbutin, in B16F10 melanoma cells, and without apparent cytotoxicity. It was found that dieckol behaved as a non-competitive inhibitor with l-tyrosine substrates. For further insight, we predicted the 3D structure of tyrosinase and used a docking algorithm to simulate binding between tyrosinase and dieckol.

Monomolecular crystalline bacterial cell surface layers (S-layers) have broad application potential in nanobiotechnology due to their ability to generate functional supramolecular structures. Here, we report that Bacillus megaterium is an excellent host organism for the heterologous expression and efficient secretion of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged versions of the S-layer protein SslA from Sporosarcina ureae ATCC 13881. Three chimeric proteins were constructed, comprising the precursor, C-terminally truncated, and N- and C-terminally truncated forms of the S-layer SslA protein tagged with the human influenza hemagglutinin epitope. For secretion of fusion proteins, the open reading frames were cloned into the Escherichia coli-Bacillus megaterium shuttle vector pHIS1525.

22093822	10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.11.005	Preparation and characterization of cobalt-substituted anthrax lethal factor.	Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase involved in the cleavage of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases near their N-termini. The current report concerns the preparation of cobalt-substituted LF (CoLF) and its characterization by electronic spectroscopy. Two strategies to produce CoLF were explored, including (i) a bio-assimilation approach involving the cultivation of LF-expressing Bacillus megaterium cells in the presence of CoCl(2), and (ii) direct exchange by treatment of zinc-LF with CoCl(2). Independent of the method employed, the protein was found to contain one Co(2+) per LF molecule, and was shown to be twice as active as its native zinc counterpart. The electronic spectrum of CoLF suggests the Co(2+) ion to be five-coordinate, an observation similar to that reported for other Co(2+)-substituted gluzincins, but distinct from that documented for the crystal structure of native LF. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies following the exposure of CoLF to thi	2012	1	27	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	Antigens, Bacterial; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Toxins; Catalytic Domain; Cell Culture Techniques; Cobalt; Kinetics; Metalloendopeptidases; Spectrophotometry; Zinc	S..bel	Crystal E

This study was taken up with a view to generate basic information on spore hardiness to ethanol in various Bacillus species and related genera, and to assess the effectiveness of different levels of ethanol as a bacterial disinfectant. Predominantly spore-bearing cultures of five Bacillus spp. (B. pumilus, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, B. fusiformis and B. flexus) that were isolated from the spent-alcohol used during plant tissue culture work were challenged with aqueous ethanol (25, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90% v/v) in 1 ml volumes at 10............

22016820	10.1371/journal.pone.0026108	Integrated proteomic and metabolomic analysis of an artificial microbial community for two-step production of vitamin C.	An artificial microbial community consisted of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium has been used in industry to produce 2-keto-gulonic acid (2-KGA), the precursor of vitamin C. During the mix culture fermentation process, sporulation and cell lysis of B. megaterium can be observed. In order to investigate how these phenomena correlate with 2-KGA production, and to explore how two species interact with each other during the fermentation process, an integrated time-series proteomic and metabolomic analysis was applied to the system. The study quantitatively identified approximate 100 metabolites and 258 proteins. Principal Component Analysis of all the metabolites identified showed that glutamic acid, 5-oxo-proline, L-sorbose, 2-KGA, 2, 6-dipicolinic acid and tyrosine were potential biomarkers to distinguish the different time-series samples. Interestingly, most of these metabolites were closely correlated with the sporulation process of B. megaterium.

The enzyme has been redesigned to catalyse the oxidation of non-natural substrates as diverse as pharmaceuticals, terpenes and gaseous alkanes using a variety of engineering strategies. Crystal structures have provided a basis for several of the catalytic effects brought about by mutagenesis, while changes to reduction potentials, inter-domain electron transfer rates and catalytic parameters have yielded functional insights. Areas of active research interest include drug metabolite production, the development of process-scale techniques, unravelling general mechanistic aspects of P450 chemistry, methane oxidation, and improving selectivity control to allow the synthesis of fine chemicals.

22004563	10.1186/1475-2859-10-81	Microalgae as bioreactors for bioplastic production.	Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a polyester with thermoplastic properties that is naturally occurring and produced by such bacteria as Ralstonia eutropha H16 and Bacillus megaterium. In contrast to currently utilized plastics and most synthetic polymers, PHB is biodegradable, and its production is not dependent on fossil resources making this bioplastic interesting for various industrial applications. In this study, we report on introducing the bacterial PHB pathway of R. eutropha H16 into the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, thereby demonstrating for the first time that PHB production is feasible in a microalgal system. Expression of the bacterial enzymes was sufficient to result in PHB levels of up to 10.6% of algal dry weight. The bioplastic accumulated in granule-like structures in the cytosol of the cells, as shown by light and electron microscopy.

The bacterial consortium demonstrated an excellent oily sludge degradation capacity, reducing 90.7% of the aliphatic fraction and 51.8% of the aromatic fraction, as well as biosurfactant production capacity, achieving 39.4% reduction of surface tension of the culture medium and an emulsifying activity of 55.1%.

21981578	10.1021/ja2060319	Bifunctional triterpene/sesquarterpene cyclase: tetraprenyl-..-curcumene cyclase is also squalene cyclase in Bacillus megaterium.	This study demonstrates that a tetraprenyl-..-curcumene cyclase, which was originally identified as a sesquarterpene cyclase that converts a head-to-tail type of monocycle to a pentacycle, also cyclizes a tail-to-tail type of linear squalene into a bicyclic triterpenol, 8..-hydroxypolypoda-13,17,21-triene. The 8..-hydroxypolypoda-13,17,21-triene was found to be a natural triterpene from B. megaterium. It was also demonstrated that cyclizations of both tetraprenyl-..-curcumene and squalene occurred with a purified B. megaterium TC homologue in the same reaction mixture. These results suggest that the tetraprenyl-..-curcumene cyclase is bifunctional, cyclizing both tetraprenyl-..-curcumene and squalene in vivo. This is the first report describing a bifunctional terpene cyclase, which biosynthesizes two classes of cyclic terpenes with different numbers of carbons as natural products in the organism.	2012	2	27	J Am Chem Soc	Journal of the American Chemical Society	Bacillus megaterium; Carbon-Oxygen Lyases; Cyclization; Molecular Structure; Stereoisomerism; Terpenes	Sato	Tsutomu

This work was aimed to isolate, purify and characterize an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) produced by a freshwater dynamic sediment-attached micro-organism, Bacillus megaterium RB-05, and study its emulsifying potential in different hydrocarbon media. Bacillus megaterium RB-05 was found to produce EPSs in glucose mineral salts medium, and maximum yield (0.864 g l(-1) ) was achieved after 24-h incubation. The recovery rates of the polysaccharide material by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography were around 67 and 93%, respectively. As evident from HPLC and FT-IR analyses, the polysaccharide was found to be a heteropolymer-containing glucose, galactose, mannose, arabinose, fucose and N-acetyl glucosamine. Different oligosaccharide combinations namely hexose(3), hexose(4), hexose(5) deoxyhexose(1) and hexose(5) deoxyhexose(1) pentose(3) were obtained after partial hydrolysis of the polymer using MALDI-ToF-MS.

21962024	10.1186/1471-2164-12-477	An attenuated strain of Bacillus anthracis (CDC 684) has a large chromosomal inversion and altered growth kinetics.	An isolate originally labeled Bacillus megaterium CDC 684 was found to contain both pXO1 and pXO2, was non-hemolytic, sensitive to gamma-phage, and produced both the protective antigen and the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule. These phenotypes prompted Ezzell et al., (J. Clin. Microbiol. 28:223) to reclassify this isolate to Bacillus anthracis in 1990. We demonstrate that despite these B. anthracis features, the isolate is severely attenuated in a guinea pig model. This prompted whole genome sequencing and closure. The comparative analysis of CDC 684 to other sequenced B. anthracis isolates and further analysis reveals: a) CDC 684 is a close relative of a virulent strain, Vollum A0488; b) CDC 684 defines a new B. anthracis lineage (at least 51 SNPs) that includes 15 other isolates; c) the genome of CDC 684 contains a large chromosomal inversion that spans 3.3 Mbp; d) this inversion has caused a displacement of the usual spatial orientation of the origin of replication (ori) to the terminat	2012	2	8	BMC Genomics	BMC genomics	Bacillus anthracis; Base Sequence; Chromosome Inversion; Genome, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide	Okinaka	Richard T

Single cell analysis is an important tool to gain deeper insights into microbial physiology for the characterization and optimization of bioprocesses. In this study a novel single cell analysis technique was applied for estimating viability and membrane potential (MP) of Bacillus megaterium cells cultured in minimal medium. Its measurement principle is based on the analysis of the electrical cell properties and is called impedance flow cytometry (IFC). Comparatively, state-of-the-art fluorescence-based flow cytometry (FCM) was used to verify the results obtained by IFC. Viability and MP analyses were performed with cells at different well-defined growth stages, focusing mainly on exponential and stationary phase cells, as well as on dead cells. This was done by PI and DiOC(2)(3) staining assays in FCM and by impedance measurements at 0.5 and 10 MHz in IFC.

The catalytic, linker, and denatured poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (dPHB)-binding domains of bacterial extracellular PHB depolymerases (PhaZs) are classified into several different types. We now report a novel class of extracellular PHB depolymerase from Bacillus sp. strain NRRL B-14911. Its catalytic domain belongs to type 1, whereas its putative linker region neither possesses the sequence features of the three known types of linker domains nor exhibits significant amino acid sequence similarity to them. Instead, this putative linker region can be divided into two distinct linker domains of novel types: LD1 and LD2. LD1 shows significant amino acid sequence similarity to certain regions of a large group of PHB depolymerase-unrelated proteins. LD2 and its homologs are present in a small group of PhaZs. The remaining C-terminal portion of this PhaZ can be further divided into two distinct domains: SBD1 and SBD2.

The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium represents an increasingly used alternative for high yield intra- and extracellular protein synthesis. During the past two decades, multiple tools including gene expression plasmids and production strains have been developed. Introduction of free replicating and integrative plasmids into B. megaterium is possible via protoplasts transformation or transconjugation. Using His(6)- and StrepII affinity tags, the intra- or extracellular produced proteins can easily be purified in one-step procedures. Different gene expression systems based on the xylose controlled promoter P(xylA) and various phage RNA polymerase (T7, SP6, K1E) driven systems enable B. megaterium to produce up to 1.25g of recombinant protein per liter.

The first whole transcriptome assessment of a Bacillus megaterium strain provides unanticipated insights into the degSU regulon considered to be of central importance for exo-enzyme production. Regulatory patterns as well as the transcription of degSU itself deviate from the model organism Bacillus subtilis; the number of DegU-regulated secretory enzymes is rather small. Targets for productivity optimization, besides degSU itself, arise from the unexpected DegU-dependent induction of the transition-state regulator AbrB during exponential growth. Induction of secretion-assisting factors, such as the translocase subunit SecY or the signal peptidase SipM, promote hypersecretion.

Developing electrode-driven biocatalytic systems utilizing the P450 cytochromes for selective oxidations depends not only on achieving electron transfer (ET) but also doing so at rates that favor native-like turnover. Herein we report studies that correlate rates of heme reduction with ET pathways and resulting product distributions. We utilized single-surface cysteine mutants of the heme domain of P450 from Bacillus megaterium and modified the thiols with N-(1-pyrene)-iodoacetamide, affording proteins that could bond to basal-plane graphite. Of the proteins examined, Cys mutants at position 62, 383, and 387 were able to form electroactive monolayers with similar E(1/2) values (-335 to -340mV vs AgCl/Ag). Respective ET rates (k(s)(o)) and heme-cysteine distances for 62, 383, and 387 are 50 s(-1) and 16.., 0.8 s(-1) and 25.., and 650 s(-1) and 19... Experiments utilizing rotated-disk electrodes were conducted to determine the products of P450-catalyzed dioxygen reduction.

21924300	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2011.08.007	Gelatin enhances 2-keto-L-gulonic acid production based on Ketogulonigenium vulgare genome annotation.	In the two-step fermentative production of vitamin C, its precursor 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) was synthesized by Ketogulonicigenium vulgare through co-culture with Bacillus megaterium. The reconstruction of the amino acid metabolic pathway through completed genome sequence annotation demonstrated that K. vulgare was deficient in one or more key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis pathways of eight different amino acids (L-histidine, L-glycine, L-lysine, L-proline, L-threonine, L-methionine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine). Among them, L-glycine, L-proline, L-threonine, and L-isoleucine play vital roles in K. vulgare growth and 2-KLG production. The addition of those amino acids increased the 2-KLG productivity by 20.4%, 17.2%, 17.2%, and 11.8%, respectively. Furthermore, food grade gelatin was developed as a substitute for the amino acids to increase the cell concentration, 2-KLG productivity, and L-sorbose consumption rate by 10.2%, 23.4%, and 20.9%, respectively.

21906327	10.1186/2191-0855-1-1	Characterization of diverse natural variants of CYP102A1 found within a species of Bacillus megaterium.	 An extreme diversity of substrates and catalytic reactions of cytochrome P450 (P450) enzymes is considered to be the consequence of evolutionary adaptation driven by different metabolic or environmental demands. Here we report the presence of numerous natural variants of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) within a species of Bacillus megaterium. Extensive amino acid substitutions (up to 5% of the total 1049 amino acid residues) were identified from the variants. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that this P450 gene evolve more rapidly than the rRNA gene locus. It was found that key catalytic residues in the substrate channel and active site are retained. Although there were no apparent variations in hydroxylation activity towards myristic acid (C14) and palmitic acid (C16), the hydroxylation rates of lauric acid (C12) by the variants varied in the range of &gt;25-fold. Interestingly, catalytic activities of the variants are promiscuous towards non-natural substrates including human P450 substrates. It c	2012	10	2	AMB Express	AMB Express	NA	Kang	Ji-Yeon
21905627		Reaction conditions for maximal cyclodextrin production by cyclodextrin glucanotransferase from Bacillus megaterium.	The effect of the reaction conditions (substrate concentration, enzyme dosage, and pH) on cyclodextrin production by cyclodextrin glucanotransferase from Bacillus megaterium was investigated by applying mathematical modeling methods. Adequate models were developed and they were used for determination of the optimal conditions for maximal formation of beta-cyclodextrins at minimal concentrations of a- and gamma-cydclodextrins. The main factor affecting the ratio of the products was pH of the reaction mixture. At pH 9 the enzyme formed mainly beta- and y-cyclodextrins and the ratio a:beta:gamma was 2.6:83.5:13.9; at pH 5 the ratio changed to 8.6:84.6:6.8. Mathematical models were used for determination of the conditions for maximal conversion of the substrate into cyclodextrins. 45.88% conversion of starch was achieved at 5% substrate concentration, 3.5 U/g enzyme dosage, and pH 7.4.	2012	3	15	Pol J Microbiol	Polish journal of microbiology	Analysis of Variance; Bacillus megaterium; Cyclodextrins; Glucosyltransferases; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Models, Biological; Regression Analysis; Starch	Zhekoval	Boriana Y
21904981	10.1007/s13238-011-1082-6	Chain length-dependent cooperativity in fatty acid binding and oxidation by cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1).	Fatty acid binding and oxidation kinetics for wild type P450(BM3) (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium have been found to display chain length-dependent homotropic behavior. Laurate and 13-methyl-myristate display Michaelis-Menten behavior while there are slight deviations with myristate at low ionic strengths. Palmitate shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics and hyperbolic binding behavior in 100 mmol/L phosphate, pH 7.4, but sigmoidal kinetics (with an apparent intercept) in low ionic strength buffers and at physiological phosphate concentrations. In low ionic strength buffers both the heme domain and the full-length enzyme show complex palmitate binding behavior that indicates a minimum of four fatty acid binding sites, with high cooperativity for the binding of the fourth palmitate molecule, and the full-length enzyme showing tighter palmitate binding than the heme domain. The first flavin-to-heme electron transfer is faster for laurate, myristate and palmitate in 100 mmol/L phosphate than	2012	4	25	Protein Cell	Protein &amp; cell	Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Fatty Acids; Lauric Acids; Myristic Acid; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Osmolar Concentration; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitic Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship	Rowlatt	Benjamin

21737497	10.1099/mic.0.051508-0	Interaction between poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) granule-associated proteins as revealed by two-hybrid analysis and identification of a new phasin in Ralstonia eutropha H16.	A large number of polypeptides are attached to poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) granules of Ralstonia eutropha, such as PHB synthase (PhaC1), several PHB depolymerases (PhaZs) and phasins (PhaPs), the regulator protein PhaR(Reu), and possibly others. In this study we used the bacterial adenylate cyclase-based two-hybrid assay to investigate interactions between known PHB granule-associated proteins (PGAPs) and to screen for new PGAPs. The utility of the system was tested by the in vivo verification of previously postulated interactions of the PHB synthase subunits of R. eutropha (PhaC1 homo-oligomerization) and of Bacillus megaterium (PhaC(Bmeg)-PhaR(Bmeg) hetero-oligomerization). Nine proteins (PhaA, PhaB1, PhaC1, PhaP1-PhaP4, PhaZ1 and PhaR), with established functions in PHB metabolism of R. eutropha, were tested for interaction in all combinations. While no significant interaction was detected between the PHB synthase PhaC1 and any of the other eight tested Pha proteins, strong intera	2012	1	23	Microbiology (Reading)	Microbiology (Reading, England)	Bacterial Proteins; Cupriavidus necator; Hydroxybutyrates; Plant Lectins; Polyesters; Protein Binding; Two-Hybrid System Techniques	Pfeiffer	Daniel

Seven new briarane diterpenoids, gemmacolides G-M (1-7), were isolated together with two known analogues, juncin O and junceellolide C, from the South China Sea gorgonian Dichotella gemmacea. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed analysis of spectroscopic data and comparison with reported data. In an in vitro bioassay, these compounds exhibited different levels of growth inhibition activity against A549 and MG63 cells. In particular, compound 4 was more active than the positive control adriamycin against A549 cells. Compounds 4 and 7 also exhibited weak antimicrobial activity against the bacterium Bacillus megaterium and the fungus Septoria tritici, respectively.	2011	10	7	J Nat Prod	Journal of natural products	Animals; Anthozoa; Anti-Infective Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Ascomycota; Bacillus megaterium; Diterpenes; Doxorubicin; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Structure; Oceans and Seas	Li	Cui

Bacillus megaterium is deep-rooted in the Bacillus phylogeny, making it an evolutionarily key species and of particular importance in understanding genome evolution, dynamics, and plasticity in the bacilli. B. megaterium is a commercially available, nonpathogenic host for the biotechnological production of several substances, including vitamin B(12), penicillin acylase, and amylases. Here, we report the analysis of the first complete genome sequences of two important B. megaterium strains, the plasmidless strain DSM319 and QM B1551, which harbors seven indigenous plasmids. The 5.1-Mbp chromosome carries approximately 5,300 genes, while QM B1551 plasmids represent a combined 417 kb and 523 genes, one of the largest plasmid arrays sequenced in a single bacterial strain. We have documented extensive gene transfer between the plasmids and the chromosome.

In order to obtain the diversity and temporal-spatial distribution of Bacillus community during the swine manure composting, we utilized traditional culture methods and the modern molecular biology techniques of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and -denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Bacillus species were firstly isolated from the composting. Based on temperature changes, the temporal-spatial characteristics of total culturable Bacillus were remarkable that the number of the culturable Bacillus detected at the high-temperature stage was the highest in each layer of the pile and that detected in the middle layer was the lowest at each stage of composting respectively. The diversity of cultivated Bacillus species isolated from different composting stages was low. A total of 540 isolates were classified by the RFLP method and partial 16S rDNA sequences.

Two Gram (+) bacterial strains, BSB6 and BSB12, showing resistance and potential for Se(IV) reduction among 26 moderately halotolerant isolates from the Bhitarkanika mangrove soil were characterized by biochemical and 16S rDNA sequence analyses. Both of them were strictly aerobic and able to grow in a wide range of pH (4-11), temperature (4-40..C) and salt concentration (4-12%) having an optimum growth at 37..C, pH ...7.5 and 7% salt (NaCl). The biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence analysis of BSB6 and BSB12 showed the closest phylogenetic similarity with the species Bacillus megaterium. Both the strains effectively reduced Se(IV) and complete reduction of selenite (up to 0.25 mM) was achieved within 40 h. SEM with energy dispersive X-ray and TEM analyses revealed the formation of nano size spherical selenium particles in and around the bacterial cells which were also supported by the confocal micrograph study.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing Bacillus strains possess class IV PHA synthases composed of two subunit types, namely, PhaR and PhaC. In the present study, PHA synthases from Bacillus megaterium NBRC15308(T) (PhaRC(Bm)), B. cereus YB-4 (PhaRC(YB4)), and hybrids (PhaR(Bm)C(YB4) and PhaR(YB4)C(Bm)) were expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 to characterize the molecular weight of the synthesized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)]. PhaRC(Bm) synthesized P(3HB) with a relatively high molecular weight (M(n) = 890 .. 10(3)) during 72 h of cultivation, whereas PhaRC(YB4) synthesized low-molecular-weight P(3HB) (M(n) = 20 .. 10(3)). The molecular weight of P(3HB) synthesized by PhaRC(YB4) decreased with increasing culture time and temperature. This time-dependent behavior was observed for hybrid synthase PhaR(Bm)C(YB4), but not for PhaR(YB4)C(Bm). These results suggest that the molecular weight change is caused by the PhaC(YB4) subunit.

Dynamic processes during wet-heat treatment of individual spores of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus subtilis at 80 to 90..C were investigated using dual-trap Raman spectroscopy, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, and nucleic acid stain (SYTO 16) fluorescence microscopy. During spore wet-heat treatment, while the spores' 1:1 chelate of Ca(2+) with dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) was released rapidly at a highly variable time T(lag), the levels of spore nucleic acids remained nearly unchanged, and the T(lag) times for individual spores from the same preparation were increased somewhat as spore levels of CaDPA increased. The brightness of the spores' DIC image decreased by ~50% in parallel with CaDPA release, and there was no spore cortex hydrolysis observed.

CYP102A1, originating from Bacillus megaterium, is a highly active enzyme which has attracted much attention because of its potential applicability as a biocatalyst for oxidative reactions. Previously we developed drug-metabolizing mutant CYP102A1 M11 by a combination of site-directed and random mutagenesis. CYP102A1 M11 contains eight mutations, when compared with wild-type CYP102A1, and is able to produce human-relevant metabolites of several pharmaceuticals. In this study, active-site residue 87 of drug-metabolizing mutant CYP102A1 M11 was mutated to all possible natural amino acids to investigate its role in substrate selectivity and regioselectivity. With alkoxyresorufins as substrates, large differences in substrate selectivities and coupling efficiencies were found, dependent on the nature of residue 87. For all combinations of alkoxyresorufins and mutants, extremely fast rates of NADPH oxidation were observed (up to 6,000..min(-1)).

The occurrence of spore-forming bacteria in powdered milk is of concern to the dairy industry due to potential deleterious effects including those resulting from proteolytic and lipolytic activities. Twenty-two powdered milk samples representative of spring and summer production obtained from Uruguayan retail stores were analyzed for type and number of thermophilic and spore-forming bacterial species. Bacillus licheniformis isolates were found to be the most prominent milk powder contaminant followed by Anoxybacillus flavithermus representing 71.5 to 84% of the total microflora. Geobacillus stearothermophilus, however, was not found. B. licheniformis strains F and G were both found in this study but strain F was the prevalent isolate representing 98.9% of the total isolates of this species.

We functionally analysed the two-component regulatory system DegSU (historically SacU) in Bacillus megaterium DSM319 by generating a genetic knock out as well as a sacU32 mutation. The latter--known to cause a hypersecretion phenotype in Bacillus subtilis--had no influence on extracellular protease and amylase activity in B. megaterium. Since the B. megaterium DegU complemented a Bacillus licheniformis ...degSU mutant, functionality of the protein was proven. Expression of the sacB encoded levansucrase was found to be dependent on DegSU in B. megaterium. Consistently, the fusion of the sacB promoter to gfp revealed a strong increase in GFP-expression in the sacU32 strain. On 2 D-gels of the secretome, a large number of intracellular proteins was seen. The culture medium contained only 42 secreted proteins which can be assigned to polypeptides involved in the metabolism of the cell wall, polypeptides with proteolytic activities and those with unknown functions.

These compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eight bacteria, e.g. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and three fungi e.g. Aspergillus oryzae, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevis. The results indicate that some of the compounds exhibit strong antibacterial activity, depending on the bacterial strain, but show virtually no antifungal activity. The structure-antibacterial activity relationships were studied using some physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters with the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted lipophilic parameters and antibacterial activity has been found.	2011	8	16	Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo)	Chemical &amp; pharmaceutical bulletin	Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antifungal Agents; Bacteria; Fungi; Hydrazines; Hydrocarbons, Cyclic; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thiazoles	Alam	Mohammad Sayed

The phytosanitary importance of the corn leafhopper, Dalbulus maidis (De Long and Wolcott) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and the planthopper, Delphacodes kuscheli Fennah (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) lies in their ability to transmit phloem-associated plant pathogens, mainly viruses and mollicutes, and to cause considerable mechanical damage to corn plants during feeding and oviposition. Fungi, particularly some members of the Ascomycota, are likely candidates for biocontrol agents against these insect pests, but several studies revealed their failure to invade the insect cuticle possibly because of the presence of inhibitory compounds such as phenols, quinones, and lipids and also by the antibiosis effect of the microbiota living on the cuticular surface of the host.

21523836	10.1002/chem.201002465	Dearomatisation of o-xylene by P450BM3 (CYP102A1).	The oxidation of o-xylene by P450(BM3) from Bacillus megaterium yields, in addition to the products formed by microsomal P450s, two metabolites containing an NIH-shifted methyl group, one of which lacks the aromatic character of the substrate. The failure of the epoxide precursor of these two products to rearrange to the more stable 2,7-dimethyloxepin suggests that ring opening is P450-mediated. With m-xylene, the principal metabolite is 2,4-dimethylphenol. The partition between aromatic and benzylic hydroxylation is primarily governed by the steric prescriptions of the active site rather than by C-H bond reactivity. It is also substrate-dependent, o- and m-xylene appearing to bind to the enzyme in different orientations. The product distributions given by variants containing the F87A mutation, which creates additional space in the active site, resemble those reported for microsomal systems.	2011	10	14	Chemistry	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)	Bacillus megaterium; Chromatography, Gas; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydrogen Bonding; Molecular Structure; Oxidation-Reduction; Xenobiotics; Xylenes	Whitehouse	Christopher J C

The expression vector, pETA-exp2, was constructed based on Bacillus-Escherichia shuttle vector pHY300PLK. The pETA-exp2 vector includes the regulator of the ETA gene (eta), the promoter and Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences of eta, a SalI sequence at the end of the signal sequence of eta, a nucleotide sequence encoding mature ETA, an XhoI site, a 6x His sequence just before the stop codon and the end of the transcription sequence of eta. The nucleotide sequences coding for the mature proteins of ETB, ExhA, ExhB, ExhC, ExhD and SHETB were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into pETA-exp2. These recombinant plasmids were transformed into Bacillus megaterium. The major protein in the culture supernatant of the transformant was recombinant ET (rET).

Bacillus megaterium RB-05 was grown on glucose and on "tossa-daisee" (Corchorus olitorius)-derived jute, and production and composition of extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) were monitored. An EPS yield of 0.065 .. 0.013 and of 0.297 g .. 0.054 g(-1) substrate after 72 h was obtained for glucose and jute, respectively. EPS production in the presence of jute paralleled bacterial cellulase activity. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), matrix assisted LASER desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectroscopy, and fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy demonstrated that the EPS synthesized in jute culture (JC) differed from that synthesized in glucose mineral salts medium (GMSM). While fucose was only a minor constituent (4.9 wt.%) of EPS from GMSM, it a major component (41.9 wt.%) of EPS synthesized in JC. This study establishes jute as an effective fermentation substrate for EPS production by a cellulase-producing bacterium.	2011	8	16	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Cellulase; Corchorus; Extracellular Space; Monosaccharides; Polysaccharides, Bacterial	Chowdhury	Sougata Roy

Despite the widespread biological function of carbohydrates, the polysaccharide synthesis mechanisms of glycosyltransferases remain largely unexplored. Bacterial levansucrases (glycoside hydrolase family 68) synthesize high molecular weight, ..-(2,6)-linked levan from sucrose by transfer of fructosyl units. The kinetic and biochemical characterization of Bacillus megaterium levansucrase SacB variants Y247A, Y247W, N252A, D257A, and K373A reveal novel surface motifs remote from the sucrose binding site with distinct influence on the polysaccharide product spectrum. The wild type activity (k(cat)) and substrate affinity (K(m)) are maintained. The structures of the SacB variants reveal clearly distinguishable subsites for polysaccharide synthesis as well as an intact active site architecture. These results lead to a new understanding of polysaccharide synthesis mechanisms. The identified surface motifs are discussed in the context of related glycosyltransferases.	2011	7	26	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Hexosyltransferases; Mutation, Missense; Polysaccharides, Bacterial	Strube	Christian P

Large populations of culturable endophytic bacteria were detected in stems and roots of wild plants colonizing rocks in the southern Sonoran Desert, but not in seeds. Among 14 endophytic bacterial isolates found in roots, four isolates were identified by full sequencing of their 16S rRNA gene.

Raman spectroscopy and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy were used to monitor the kinetics of nutrient and nonnutrient germination of multiple individual untreated and wet-heat-treated spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium, as well as of several isogenic Bacillus subtilis strains. Major conclusions from this work were as follows. (i) More than 90% of these spores were nonculturable but retained their 1:1 chelate of Ca..+ and dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) when incubated in water at 80 to 95..C for 5 to 30 min. (ii) Wet-heat treatment significantly increased the time, T(lag), at which spores began release of the great majority of their CaDPA during the germination of B. subtilis spores with different nutrient germinants and also increased the variability of T(lag) values. (iii) The time period, ..T(release), between T(lag) and the time, T(release), at which a spore germinating with nutrients completed the release of the great majority of its CaDPA, was also incre	2011	8	22	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Calcium; Hot Temperature; Microscopy, Interference; Picolinic Acids; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Spores; Time Factors; Water	Wang	Guiwen
21431175	10.1039/c1mt00004g	Analysis of the oxidation of short chain alkynes by flavocytochrome P450 BM3.	Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (BM3) is a high activity fatty acid hydroxylase, formed by the fusion of soluble cytochrome P450 and cytochrome P450 reductase modules. Short chain (C6, C8) alkynes were shown to be substrates for BM3, with productive outcomes (i.e. alkyne hydroxylation) dependent on position of the carbon-carbon triple bond in the molecule. Wild-type P450 BM3 catalyses ..-3 hydroxylation of both 1-hexyne and 1-octyne, but is suicidally inactivated in NADPH-dependent turnover with non-terminal alkynes. A F87G mutant of P450 BM3 also undergoes turnover-dependent heme destruction with the terminal alkynes, pointing to a key role for Phe87 in controlling regioselectivity of alkyne oxidation. The terminal alkynes access the BM3 heme active site led by the acetylene functional group, since hydroxylated products are not observed near the opposite end of the molecules. For both 1-hexyne and 1-octyne, the predominant enantiomeric product formed (up to ...90%) is the	2011	7	25	Metallomics	Metallomics : integrated biometal science	Alkynes; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Models, Molecular; Mutation; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction	Waltham	Timothy N

Bacillus subtilis BCC41051 producing a thermostable ..-mannanase was isolated from soybean meal-enriched soil and was unexpectedly found to be thermophilic in nature. The extracellular ..-mannanase (ManA) produced was hydrophilic, as it was not precipitated even with ammonium sulfate at 80% saturation. The estimated molecular weight of ManA was 38.0 kDa by SDS-PAGE with a pi value of 5.3. Optimal pH and temperature for mannan-hydrolyzing activity was 7.0 and 60..C, respectively. The enzyme was stable over a pH range of 5.0-11.5, and at temperatures of up to 60..C for 30 min, with more than 80% of its activity retained. ManA was strongly inhibited by Hg(2+) (1 mM), but was sensitive to other divalent ions to a lesser degree. The gene of ManA encoded a protein of 362 amino acid residues, with the first 26 residues identified as a signal peptide. High expression of recombinant ManA was achieved in both Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (415.18 U/ml) and B. megaterium UNcat (359 U/ml).	2011	6	8	J Microbiol	Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)	Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Cations, Divalent; Chemical Fractionation; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Stability; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Isoelectric Point; Mercury; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Protein Sorting Signals; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; Temperature; beta-Mannosidase	Summpunn	Pijug
21301191	10.4014/jmb.1006.06012	Microbiological purification of L-arabitol from xylitol mother liquor.	As a rare sugar alcohol, L-arabitol can be used in food and can prevent extra fat deposits in the intestinal tract. Commercially, L-arabitol is prepared from pure L-arabinose by hydrogenation, which needs a high temperature and high pressure, leading to a high production cost for Larabitol. Therefore, this study describes a novel L-arabitol production method based on biological purification from the xylitol mother liquor, a cheap and readily available raw material that contains a high concentration of Larabitol. First, a novel Bacillus megaterium strain was screened that can utilize xylitol, sorbitol, and mannitol, yet not L-arabitol. The isolated strain was inoculated into a medium containing the xylitol mother liquor under formulated culture conditions, where a high L-arabitol yield (95%) and high purity (80%) were obtained when the medium was supplemented with 50 g/l of xylitol mother liquor.

The cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 catalyzes hydroxylations of a variety of 3-oxo-..(4) -steroids such as progesterone and deoxycorticosterone (DOC), mainly in the 15..-position. We combined a high-throughput screening and a rational approach for identifying new substrates of CYP106A2. The diterpene resin acid abietic acid was found to be a substrate and was docked into the active site of a CYP106A2 homology model to provide further inside into the structural basis of the regioselectivity of hydroxylation. The products of the hydroxylation reaction were analyzed by HPLC and the V(max) and K(m) values were calculated. The corresponding reaction products were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and identified as 12..- and 12..-hydroxyabietic acid. CYP106A2 was therefore identified as the first reported bacterial cytochrome P450 diterpene hydroxylase.

21240430	10.1039/c0mt00082e	Control of the stereo-selectivity of styrene epoxidation by cytochrome P450 BM3 using structure-based mutagenesis.	The potential of flavocytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium for biocatalysis and biotechnological application is widely acknowledged. The catalytic and structural analysis of the Ala82Phe mutant of P450 BM3 has shown that filling a hydrophobic pocket near the active site improved the binding of small molecules, such as indole (see Huang et al., J. Mol. Biol., 2007, 373, 633) and styrene. In this paper, additional mutations at Thr438 are shown to decrease the binding of and catalytic activity towards laurate, whereas they significantly increased the stereo-specificity of styrene epoxidation. Production of R-styrene oxide with 48% and 64% e.e., respectively, was achieved by the Ala82Phe-Thr438Leu and Ala82Phe-Thr438Phe mutants. These structure-based mutants of P450 BM3 illustrate the promise of rational design of synthetically useful biocatalysts for regio- and stereo- specific mono-oxygenation reactions.	2011	7	25	Metallomics	Metallomics : integrated biometal science	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Epoxy Compounds; Industrial Microbiology; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutant Proteins; Mutation; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Styrene	Huang	Wei-Cheng

Soil-microorganism symbioses are of fundamental importance for plant adaptation to the environment. Research in microbial ecology has revealed that some soil bacteria are associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, these interactions may be much more complex than originally thought. To assess the type of bacteria associated with AMF, we initially isolated spores of Glomus irregulare from an Agrostis stolonifera rhizosphere. The spores were washed with sterile water and plated onto G. irregulare mycelium growing in vitro in a root-free compartment of bicompartmented Petri dishes. We hypothesized that this system should select for bacteria closely associated with the fungus because the only nutrients available to the bacteria were those derived from the hyphae. Twenty-nine bacterial colonies growing on the AMF hyphae were subcultured and identified using 16S rRNA gene sequences.

Microbial contaminants on spacecraft can threaten the scientific integrity of space missions due to probable interference with life detection experiments. Therefore, space agencies measure the cultivable spore load ("bioburden") of a spacecraft. A recent study has reported an insufficient recovery of Bacillus atrophaeus spores from Vectran fabric, a typical spacecraft airbag material (A. Probst, R. Facius, R. Wirth, and C. Moissl-Eichinger, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 76:5148-5158, 2010). Here, 10 different sampling methods were compared for B. atrophaeus spore recovery from this rough textile, revealing significantly different efficiencies (0.5 to 15.4%). The most efficient method, based on the wipe-rinse technique (foam-spatula protocol; 13.2% efficiency), was then compared to the current European Space Agency (ESA) standard wipe assay in sampling four different kinds of spacecraft-related surfaces.

A two-stage system was developed which combines the biological degradation of keratin-rich waste with the production of biogas. Chicken feather waste was treated biologically with a recombinant Bacillus megaterium strain showing keratinase activity prior to biogas production. Chopped, autoclaved chicken feathers (4%, W/V) were completely degraded, resulting in a yellowish fermentation broth with a level of 0.51 mg/mL soluble proteins after 8 days of cultivation of the recombinant strain. During the subsequent anaerobic batch digestion experiments, methane production of 0.35 Nm3/kg dry feathers (i.e., 0.4 Nm3/kg volatile solids of feathers), corresponding to 80% of the theoretical value on proteins, was achieved from the feather hydrolyzates, independently of the pre-hydrolysis time period of 1, 2 or 8 days.

20955171	10.2174/092986611794328627	Bacteriostatic activity of the proregion of human hepcidin.	Hepcidin was first identified as an antimicrobial peptide expressed in the liver. It was later demonstrated that hepcidin is in fact the long sought hormone that regulates iron homeostasis in mammals. Hepcidin is encoded as an 84 amino acid prepropeptide that is successively cleaved to yield prohepcidin and the mature 25 amino acid hepcidin. Both the bioactive 25-aa hepcidin and the 35-aa proregion are secreted by liver hepatocytes. The aim of the present study was to assess the antibacterial activity of the proregion peptide from human hepcidin. Using a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to the proregion, we show that it is bactericidal against Bacillus megaterium (25..M), and inhibits Bacillus subtilis growth at high concentration (200..M). No synergistic interaction of proregion and Hepc25 against Bacillus megaterium was seen. In a further step, the mode of action of proregion on Bacillus megaterium was studied.

Cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium is a self-sufficient monooxygenase that consists of a heme domain and FAD/FMN-containing reductase domain (BMR). In this report, the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) by BMR was evaluated as a method for monitoring BMR activity. The electron transfer proceeds from NADPH to BMR and then to BMR substrates, MTT and CTC. MTT and CTC are monotetrazolium salts that form formazans upon reduction. The reduction of MTT and CTC followed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics (kcat =4120 min(-1), Km =77 ..M for MTT and kcat =6580 min(-1), Km =51 ..M for CTC). Our continuous assay using MTT and CTC allows the simple, rapid measurement of BMR activity. The BMR was able to metabolize mitomycin C and doxorubicin, which are anticancer drug substrates for CPR, producing the same metabolites as those produced by CPR.

23443101	10.3390/ijms131215901	Optimization of the bacterial cytochrome P450 BM3 system for the production of human drug metabolites.	Drug metabolism in human liver is a process involving many different enzymes. Among them, a number of cytochromes P450 isoforms catalyze the oxidation of most of the drugs commercially available. Each P450 isoform acts on more than one drug, and one drug may be oxidized by more than one enzyme. As a result, multiple products may be obtained from the same drug, and as the metabolites can be biologically active and may cause adverse drug reactions (ADRs), the metabolic profile of a new drug has to be known before this can be commercialized. Therefore, the metabolites of a certain drug must be identified, synthesized and tested for toxicity. Their synthesis must be in sufficient quantities to be used for metabolic tests. This review focuses on the progresses done in the field of the optimization of a bacterial self-sufficient and efficient cytochrome P450, P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium, used for the production of metabolites of human enzymes.

Pomegranate juice (PJ) samples were produced with three different pressing programs: (1) 1.2-4.8 bar for 25 min, (2) 1.2-2.4 bar for 15 min and (3) 1.2-1.8 bar for 5.5 min. Respective juice yields were 39.2%, 33.2% and 27.2%. Effects of pressing pressure-time and yield on total phenolic (TP) content, condensed tannin (CT) content, monomeric anthocyanin (MA) content, antioxidant activity (AOA) and antimicrobial activity (AMA) of the samples were determined. Strong positive linear correlations were found between the pressing pressure with AOA (r=0.973) and TP content (r=0.979), while negative logarithmic correlations were found between pressing pressure with the contents of CT (r=-0.778) and MA (r=-0.955). Among 12 microorganisms tested, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Pseudomonas sp. were found to be sensitive to juice samples. However, increasing pressing pressure and yield did not lead to a significant change on the AMAs of the juices.	2013	8	16	Food Chem	Food chemistry	Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antioxidants; Bacillus; Beverages; Food Handling; Fruit; Hot Temperature; Lythraceae; Phenols; Plant Preparations; Pressure; Pseudomonas; Staphylococcus aureus	T..rky..lmaz	Meltem

Microbial biosurfactants produce foam during aerobic-fermentation processes. The degree of foaminess and foam stability of the lipopeptide-biosurfactant produced by a marine Bacillus megaterium strain were investigated using simulated biosurfactant solution (SBS), biosurfactant broth without cells (BBWOC) and biosurfactant broth with cells (BBWC) in bubble column experiments. The experimental data for foam collapse were fitted using a first-order foam decay model. The first-order rate constant (k), a measure of foam stability, was maximum (k=0.0003 S(-1)) for BBWOC in the pH range 6-9. However, maximum foam stability (k=0.0006 S(-1)) was restricted to pH 7 for BBWC. Foam-based metal removal studies revealed that the metal removal followed a saturation model.

23254762	10.1007/s00253-012-4612-0	Application of a new versatile electron transfer system for cytochrome P450-based Escherichia coli whole-cell bioconversions.	Cytochromes P450 monooxygenases are highly interesting biocatalysts for biotechnological applications, since they perform a diversity of reactions on a broad range of organic molecules. Nevertheless, the application of cytochromes P450 is limited compared to other enzymes mainly because of the necessity of a functional redox chain to transfer electrons from NAD(P)H to the monooxygenase. In this study, we established a novel robust redox chain based on adrenodoxin, which can deliver electrons to mitochondrial, bacterial and microsomal P450s. The natural membrane-associated reductase of adrenodoxin was replaced by the soluble Escherichia coli reductase. We could demonstrate for the first time that this reductase can transfer electrons to adrenodoxin.

23230286	10.1128/IAI.00653-12	Association with soil bacteria enhances p38-dependent infection resistance in Caenorhabditis elegans.	The importance of our inner microbial communities for proper immune responses against invading pathogens is now well accepted, but the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. Since very little is known about the microbes interacting with C. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the C. elegans microbiota. We established a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil.

23226010	10.4137/BBI.S7977	Functional Annotation Analytics of Bacillus Genomes Reveals Stress Responsive Acetate Utilization and Sulfate Uptake in the Biotechnologically Relevant Bacillus megaterium.	Bacillus species form an heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria that include members that are disease-causing, biotechnologically-relevant, and can serve as biological research tools. A common feature of Bacillus species is their ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions by formation of resistant endospores. Genes encoding the universal stress protein (USP) domain confer cellular and organismal survival during unfavorable conditions such as nutrient depletion. As of February 2012, the genome sequences and a variety of functional annotations for at least 123 Bacillus isolates including 45 Bacillus cereus isolates were available in public domain bioinformatics resources. Additionally, the genome sequencing status of 10 of the B. cereus isolates were annotated as finished with each genome encoded 3 USP genes. The conservation of gene neighborhood of the 140 aa universal stress protein in the B. cereus genomes led to the identification of a predicted plasmid-encoded trans	2012	12	11	Bioinform Biol Insights	Bioinformatics and biology insights	ATP-binding; Bacillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Sir2; acetate utilization; sirtuins; sulfate uptake; universal stress proteins	Williams	Baraka S

There is wide spread interest in drugs derived from plants as green medicine is believed to be safe and dependable, compared with costly synthetic drugs that have adverse effects. We have attempted to evaluate the antioxidant, In vitro thrombolytic, antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic effects of Clausena heptaphylla (Rutaceae) stem bark extract ethanol extract. Ethanolic stem bark extract of Clausena heptaphylla (CHET) contains flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and steroids but it lacks tannins, anthraquinones and resins. Phenol content of the extract was 13.42 mg/g and flavonoid content was 68.9 mg/g. CHET exhibited significant DPPH free radical scavenging activity with IC50 value of 3.11 ..g/ml. Reducing power of CHET was also moderately stronger. In the cytotoxicity assay, LC50 and Chi-square value of the ethanolic extract against brine shrimp nauplii were 144.1461 ..g/ml and 0.8533 demonstrating potent cytotoxic effect of the extract.

It is well known that carbohydrates play fundamental roles in cell signaling and infection processes as well as tumor formation and progression. However, the interaction pathways and cellular receptors targeted by carbohydrates and glycoconjugates remain poorly examined and understood. This lack of research stems, at least to a major part, from accessibility problems of large, branched oligosaccharides. To test glycan-cell interactions in vitro, a variety of tailored oligosaccharides was synthesized chemo-enzymatically. Glycosyltransferases from the GRAS organisms Bacillus megaterium (SacB) and Aspergillus niger (Suc1) were used in this study. Substrate engineering of these glycosyltransferases generally acting on sucrose leads to the controlled formation of novel tailored di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides.

Co-culturing Bacillus megaterium and Ketogulonigenium vulgare is widely applied to 2-keto-gulonic acid production. For optimizing the process, numerous researchers studied on the symbiotic molecular mechanism of the co-culture process. The research was promoted greatly owing to omics technologies, bioinformatics, high throughput technologies and physiology. Recently, the proteomic, metabolomic, comparative genomics and transcriptomics were performed to the research. These omics data provided us the interaction network of the artificial ecosystem in multilevel. Combining with the physiological validation based on the high throughput method, we can elucidate the molecular mechanism in detail, which will facilitate us to develop strategies for metabolic engineering. The paper reviewed the recent developments of symbiotic molecular mechanism research in this co-culture process and its applications. In addition, we proposed the future research needs.	2013	1	8	Wei Sheng Wu Xue Bao	Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica	Bacillus megaterium; Coculture Techniques; Genomics; Metabolomics; Rhodobacteraceae; Sugar Acids	Zhu	Yibo
23155054	10.1074/jbc.M112.422535	Characterization of the enzyme CbiH60 involved in anaerobic ring contraction of the cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthetic pathway.	The anaerobic pathway for the biosynthesis of cobalamin (vitamin B(12)) has remained poorly characterized because of the sensitivity of the pathway intermediates to oxygen and the low activity of enzymes. One of the major bottlenecks in the anaerobic pathway is the ring contraction step, which has not been observed previously with a purified enzyme system. The Gram-positive aerobic bacterium Bacillus megaterium has a complete anaerobic pathway that contains an unusual ring contraction enzyme, CbiH(60), that harbors a C-terminal extension with sequence similarity to the nitrite/sulfite reductase family. To improve solubility, the enzyme was homologously produced in the host B. megaterium DSM319. CbiH(60) was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance and shown to contain a [4Fe-4S] center. Assays with purified recombinant CbiH(60) demonstrate that the enzyme converts both cobalt-precorrin-3 and cobalt factor III into the ring-contracted product cobalt-precorrin-4 in high yields, w	2013	2	28	J Biol Chem	The Journal of biological chemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Biosynthetic Pathways; Catalysis; Cloning, Molecular; Cobalt; Cobamides; Dithiothreitol; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mass Spectrometry; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Mutagenesis; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxygen; Recombinant Proteins; Solubility; Vitamin B 12	Moore	Simon J

Koch (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrubby herb and is generally distributed in Armenia, Iran, and Middle Anatolia. This species traditionally has been used in medicines. The aim of this research is to study the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia spicigera populations in northwest of Iran. The essential oil of A. spicigera was obtained by hydrodistillation from eight populations collected from different regions of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan provinces (Iran) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using MIC determinations and the agar-gel diffusion method.

A xylanase gene (xynG1-1) from Paenibacillus campinasensis G1-1 was expressed in Bacillus megaterium MS941 and a high level of extracellular xylansae activity (304.26 IU/mL) was achieved after induction with 0.5% xylose. The purified recombinant xylanase (XynG1-1R) revealed optimal activity at 60..C and pH 7.0 and retained 79% and 81% activity after incubation without substrate at 60..C, pH 5.0 and pH 8.0 for 3h, respectively. Application of XynG1-1R (15 IU/g pulp) to cotton stalk pulp bleaching increased brightness by 3.65% over that of the control without the xylanase and reduced the need for chlorine compounds by 50% without loss of brightness and pulp fiber qualities. When XynG1-1R (80 IU/g paper sludge) was used in combination with mixed cellulolytic enzymes, the saccharification efficiency of recycled paper sludge was increased by 10%. These results indicated that XynG1-1R is a promising candidate for various industrial applications such as biobleaching and bioenergy conversion.	2013	4	17	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Color; Endo-1,4-beta Xylanases; Gossypium; Paenibacillus; Paper; Plant Components, Aerial; Plant Extracts; Protein Engineering; Recycling; Sewage; Up-Regulation; Xylose	Zheng	Hongchen

In the well-understood ParMRC plasmid partitioning system, adapter protein ParR binds to centromere parC, forming a helix around which the DNA is externally wrapped. This complex stabilizes the growth of a filament of actin-like ParM protein, which pushes the plasmids to the poles. The TubZRC plasmid partitioning system consists of two proteins, tubulin-like TubZ and TubR, and a DNA centromere, tubC, which perform analogous roles to those in ParMRC, despite being unrelated in sequence and structure. We have dissected in detail the binding sites that comprise Bacillus thuringiensis tubC, visualized the TubRC complex by electron microscopy, and determined a crystal structure of TubR bound to the tubC repeat.

The key step in this process is the conversion of L-sorbose to 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG), the vitamin C precursor, which is accomplished by an artificial microbial ecosystem consisting of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium. This review describes current progress in understanding this ecosystem, not only the individual physiological characteristics of the two strains, but also the interactions between them. Special emphasis is placed on recent systems biology studies of the ecosystem. We also discuss the regulation and improvement of this ecosystem, including analysis of the fermentation medium components and genetic engineering and optimum fermentative strategies.

The alkali assay reveals the ability of this cytochrome to oxidize NADPH in the presence of nine out of thirteen 1,2,5-oxadiazole derivatives tested.

In order to develop in vitro methods as an alternative to P450 animal testing in the drug discovery process, two main requisites are necessary: 1) gathering of data on animal homologues of the human P450 enzymes, currently very limited, and 2) bypassing the requirement for both the P450 reductase and the expensive cofactor NADPH. In this work, P450 2C20 from Macaca fascicularis, homologue of the human P450 2C8 has been taken as a model system to develop such an alternative in vitro method by two different approaches. In the first approach called "molecular Lego", a soluble self-sufficient chimera was generated by fusing the P450 2C20 domain with the reductase domain of cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium (P450 2C20/BMR). In the second approach, the need for the redox partner and also NADPH were both obviated by the direct immobilization of the P450 2C20 on glassy carbon and gold electrodes.

To investigate the bacteria community and biodiversity of four-years pickled Yanshan Dongcai. We studied the bacterial communities of Dongcai by 16S rDNA diversity analysis and the cultured species isolated from Dongcai sample by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rDNA diversity showed that the bacteria belonged to the phyla Proteobacteria (87.9% ) and Firmicutes (7.1% ), including many moderately halophilic bacteria such as Virgibacillus kekensis, Marinococcus albus, Salinicoccus sp., Lactobacillus halophilus and Halomonas. Only 5% of clone sequences belonged to the phylum Actinobacteria. Thirty-five strains were isolated from Dongcai sample, and 16S rDNA-RFLP analysis indicated that 34 isolates affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes, including Virgibacillus, Bacillus megaterium and Gracilibacillus saliphilus which were moderately halophilic bacteria, but only one isolate belonged to the phylum Actinobacteria.

The search for alternative sources of energy, such as biodiesel, has been stimulated, since this biofuel is highly susceptible for biodegradation and has low toxicity, thus, reducing the impact in ecosystems. The objective of this study was to select a bacterial consortium with potential for degrading diesel/biodiesel blends (B20) obtained from areas contaminated with hydrocarbons/esters. In order to evaluate the biodegrability of the blend, six enzyme assays were conducted: alkane hydroxylase, Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, Protocatechol 3,4-dioxygenase, ..-NPA hydrolysis (esterase), and release of fatty acids through titration (lipase), with estimative of total protein and biosurfactant production (surface tension measurement and emulsifying index E(24)).

This paper describes the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of a Gram-positive, aerobic bacterial population isolated from the chlorine tank of a wastewater treatment plant. A total of 12 sporeforming, rod-shaped isolates were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and biochemical tests. Pairwise genetic comparisons revealed the identity among sequences obtained from isolates varied from 92.6 to 100%. Similarity searches on GenBank showed that five strains were closely related (99 to 100% identity) to Bacillus subtilis and two were almost identical (99%) to B. megaterium and B. licheniformis. Because the five remaining strains were either closely related (97 to 99% identity) or identical to B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. anthracis, they were classified as belonging to the B. cereus group. Apart from one strain, all clades in the phylogenetic tree were identical to clusters formed in the dendrogram based on biochemical tests results.

This study was carried out to determine the optimal folding condition of ..-amylase from Bacillus megaterium WHO using response surface methodology (RSM). A first-order model showed that three factors namely glycerol, Ca(2+) and protein concentration had the most significant effect on refolding. Analysis of the results showed that glycerol was better than the other polyols due to its effect on protein stability. Since ..-amylases are known to contain calcium ions in their structure, the presence of calcium in the refolding buffer was compulsory. The concentration of protein had the most significant quadratic effect on the response studied. A second-order polynomial model was developed to quantify the relationships between variables. It was shown that the combination of 20%(v/v) glycerol, 25 mM Ca(2+) and 0.3 (mg/ml) protein was the most efficient condition for in vitro refolding of ..-amylase. Under the optimal condition the yield of refolding was enhanced up to 7-fold.

Most reductases which belong to the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily require NAD (P) H for activity. Addition of this cofactor was still necessary for the production of ethyl (S)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate by Escherichia coli even when a cofactor regeneration system was constructed by co-expressing carbonyl reductase from Pichia stipitis (PsCRI) and glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus megaterium (BmGDH). In an attempt to reduce dependence on the expensive cofactor, compounds directly or indirectly involved in NADP synthesis were added to the medium. Only glutamine and xylose enhanced the content of intracellular NADP (H) and the concentration of product. The concentration and yield of (S)-CHBE reached 730 mM and 48.7%, with 30 g/L of glutamine and 40 g/L of xylose, a 2.6-fold increase over the control without the addition of the two compounds.	2012	11	5	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Aspartic Acid; Biocatalysis; Butyrates; Culture Media; Escherichia coli; Glutamine; Niacin; Recombination, Genetic; Ribose; Xylose	Li	Nan

22616870	10.1042/BST20120066	The anaerobic biosynthesis of vitamin B12.	Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is a cobalt-containing modified tetrapyrrole that is an essential nutrient for higher animals. Its biosynthesis is restricted to certain bacteria and requires approximately 30 enzymatic steps for its complete de novo construction. Remarkably, two distinct biosynthetic pathways exist, which are termed the aerobic and anaerobic routes. The anaerobic pathway has yet to be fully characterized due to the inherent instability of its oxygen-sensitive intermediates. Bacillus megaterium, a bacterium previously used for the commercial production of cobalamin, has a complete anaerobic pathway and this organism is now being used to investigate the anaerobic B12 pathway through the application of recent advances in recombinant protein production. The present paper provides a summary of recent findings in the anaerobic pathway and future perspectives.	2012	9	13	Biochem Soc Trans	Biochemical Society transactions	Aerobiosis; Anaerobiosis; Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Biosynthetic Pathways; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Vitamin B 12	Moore	Simon J
22615245	10.1128/IAI.00215-12	A chimeric toxin vaccine protects against primary and recurrent Clostridium difficile infection.	The global emergence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has contributed to the recent surge in severe antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colonic inflammation. C. difficile produces two homologous glucosylating exotoxins, TcdA and TcdB, both of which are pathogenic and require neutralization to prevent disease occurrence. However, because of their large size and complex multifunctional domain structures, it has been a challenge to produce native recombinant toxins that may serve as vaccine candidates. Here, we describe a novel chimeric toxin vaccine that retains major neutralizing epitopes from both toxins and confers complete protection against primary and recurrent CDI in mice. Using a nonpathogenic Bacillus megaterium expression system, we generated glucosyltransferase-deficient holotoxins and demonstrated their loss of toxicity. The atoxic holotoxins induced potent antitoxin neutralizing antibodies showing little cross-immunogenicity or protection between TcdA and TcdB.

Daqu is a traditional fermentation starter that is used for Chinese liquor production. Although partly mechanized, its manufacturing process has remained traditional. We investigated the microbial diversity of Fen-Daqu, a starter for light-flavour liquor, using combined culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches (PCR-DGGE). A total of 190 microbial strains, comprising 109 bacteria and 81 yeasts and moulds, were isolated and identified on the basis of the sequences of their 16S rDNA (bacteria) and 26S rDNA and ITS regions (fungi). DGGE of DNA extracted from Daqu was used to complement the culture-dependent method in order to include non-culturable microbes. Both approaches revealed that Bacillus licheniformis was an abundant bacterial species, and Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, and Pichia kudriavzevii were the most common yeasts encountered in Fen-Daqu. Six genera of moulds (Absidia, Aspergillus, Mucor, Rhizopus, Rhizomucor and Penicillium) were found. 	2012	10	11	Food Microbiol	Food microbiology	Bacteria; Biodiversity; Colony Count, Microbial; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Fungal; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Fermentation; Metagenome; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Wine; Yeasts	Zheng	Xiao-Wei
22586913		Isolation and characterization of feather degrading enzymes from Bacillus megaterium SN1 isolated from Ghazipur poultry waste site.	The SN1 strain of Bacillus megaterium, isolated from soil of Ghazipur poultry waste site (India) produced extracellular caseinolytic and keratinolytic enzymes in basal media at 30 degrees C, 160 rpm in the presence of 10% feather. Feathers were completely degraded after 72 h of incubation. The caesinolytic enzyme was separated from the basal media following ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion exchange chromatography. We report 29.3-fold purification of protease after Q Sepharose chromatography. The molecular weight of this enzyme was estimated to be 30 kDa as shown by SDS-PAGE and zymography studies. Protease activity increased by 2-fold in presence of 10 mM Mn2+ whereas Ba2+ and Hg2+ inhibited it. Ratio of milk clotting activity to caseinolytic was found to be 520.8 activity for the 30-60% ammonium sulphate fraction in presence of Mn2+ ion suggesting potential application in dairy industry.

Thermodynamic analysis of the nanoparticle-induced stability revealed an enhanced entropy-enthalpy compensation by the NP-PLs since a reciprocal linearity of the enthalpy-entropy change to 90 ..C was observed. Without nanoparticles, the linearity range was 70 ..C. Such compensation reflected the maintenance of the native structure of proteins.

Tyrosinase is a member of the type 3 copper enzyme family involved in the production of melanin in a wide range of organisms. The ability of tyrosinases to convert monophenols into diphenols has stimulated studies regarding the production of substituted catechols, important intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymerization inhibitors, and antioxidants. Despite its enormous potential, the use of tyrosinases for catechol synthesis has been limited due to the low monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio. In the presence of two water miscible ionic liquids, [BMIM][BF(4)] and ethylammonium nitrate, the selectivity of a tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (TyrBm) was altered, and the ratio of monophenolase/diphenolase activity increased by up to 5-fold.

Spherical 3.5 nm diameter silver nanoparticles (AgNP) stabilized in type I collagen (AgNP@collagen) were prepared in minutes (5-15 min) at room temperature by a photochemical method initiated by UVA irradiation of a water-soluble non-toxic benzoin. This biocomposite was examined to evaluate its biocompatibility and its anti-bacterial properties and showed remarkable properties. Thus, while keratinocytes and fibroblasts were not affected by AgNP@collagen, it was bactericidal against Bacillus megaterium and E. coli but only bacteriostatic against S. epidermidis. In particular, the bactericidal properties displayed by AgNP@collagen were proven to be due to AgNP in AgNP@collagen, rather than to released silver ions, since equimolar concentrations of Ag are about four times less active than AgNP@collagen based on total Ag content.

Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is one of the sulfurous pollutants present in the waste gas generated from the pulp and paper industry. DMS has environmental health implications; therefore, it is necessary to treat the waste gas containing DMS prior to discharge into the environment. A bench-scale biofilter was operated in the laboratory as well as in a pulp and paper industry for the treatment of DMS. Both the biofilters were packed with pre-sterilized wood chips and cow dung/compost of the same origin seeded with biomass developed from garden soil enriched with DMS. The biofilters were operated for the generation of process parameters, and the potential microorganisms isolated from both the biofilters have been purified and characterized for degradation of DMS. Further, these cultures were purified on a basal medium using DMS as a sole carbon source for the growth. Further, the purified cultures were characterized through standard fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)-gas chromatography method, and	2012	12	7	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology	Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromatography, Gas; Paper; Soil Microbiology; Sulfides; Textile Industry	Giri	Balendu Shekher
22430059	10.1007/s10646-012-0882-7	Biodegradation of bensulfuron-methyl and its effect on bacterial community in paddy soils.	Bensulfuron-methyl (BSM) is a new kind of sulfonylurea herbicide widely used to control broad-leaf weeds in rice paddies. The aim of this work was to study BSM biodegradation in paddy soils with BSM-degrading bacteria Bacillus megaterium L1 and Brevibacterium sp. BH and its effect on the structures of soil bacterial community. More than 90 % of BSM could be degraded in paddy soils with 0.0355 mg kg..... BSM concentration. Addition of BSM-degrading bacterial strains Bacillus megaterium L1 into BSM contaminated paddy soil could have the half-life time of BSM compared to treatment without Bacillus megaterium L1 inoculation. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and principle component analysis indicated that the diversity of the soil microbial community structure changed along with the addition of BSM, which recovered at the end of the experiment (5 weeks). Addition of BSM-degrading bacteria Bacillus megaterium L1 enriched the diversity of soil microbial community structure in paddy soi	2012	11	8	Ecotoxicology	Ecotoxicology (London, England)	Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Brevibacterium; DNA, Bacterial; Half-Life; Herbicides; Oryza; Phylogeny; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonylurea Compounds	Lin	Xiao-Yan
22426093	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2012.02.018	Autodisplay of functional CYP106A2 in Escherichia coli.	Cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyse a wide variety of reactions, including the hydroxylation and epoxidation of CC bonds, and dealkylation reactions. There is high interest in these reactions for biotechnology and pharmaceutical processes. Many P450s require membrane surroundings and have substrates that do not cross biological membranes. To circumvent these obstacles, CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium was expressed on the outer membrane of Escherichia coli cells by Autodisplay. Exposure on the surface was confirmed by a protease accessibility test and flow cytometry after immunolabelling. HPLC assays showed that 0.5 ml of cells displaying the enzyme (OD......... = 6) converted 9.13 ..mol of deoxycorticosterone to 15..-OH-deoxycorticosterone within 1h. Imipramine and abietic acid were also accepted as substrates. The number of active enzyme molecules per cell was calculated to be 20,000.

22396551	10.1074/jbc.M111.336495	Macin family of antimicrobial proteins combines antimicrobial and nerve repair activities.	The tertiary structures of theromacin and neuromacin confirmed the macin protein family as a self-contained family of antimicrobial proteins within the superfamily of scorpion toxin-like proteins. The macins, which also comprise hydramacin-1, are antimicrobially active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Despite high sequence identity, the three proteins showed distinct differences with respect to their biological activity. Neuromacin exhibited a significantly stronger capacity to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane of Bacillus megaterium than theromacin and hydramacin-1. Accordingly, it is the only macin that displays pore-forming activity and that was potently active against Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, neuromacin and hydramacin-1 led to an aggregation of bacterial cells that was not observed with theromacin. Analysis of the molecular surface properties of macins allowed confirmation of the barnacle model as the mechanistic model for the aggregation effect.

22384164	10.1371/journal.pone.0032156	Proteomic analysis of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare under glutathione reveals high demand for thiamin transport and antioxidant protection.	Ketogulonicigenium vulgare, though grows poorly when mono-cultured, has been widely used in the industrial production of the precursor of vitamin C with the coculture of Bacillus megaterium. Various efforts have been made to clarify the synergic pattern of this artificial microbial community and to improve the growth and production ability of K. vulgare, but there is still no sound explanation. In previous research, we found that the addition of reduced glutathione into K. vulgare monoculture could significantly improve its growth and productivity. By performing SEM and TEM, we observed that after adding GSH into K. vulgare monoculture, cells became about 4-6 folds elongated, and formed intracytoplasmic membranes (ICM). To explore the molecular mechanism and provide insights into the investigation of the synergic pattern of the co-culture system, we conducted a comparative iTRAQ-2-D-LC-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of K. vulgare grown under reduced glutathione.

22377146	10.1016/j.watres.2012.02.004	Occurrence of sulfonamide and tetracycline-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in aquaculture environment.	The occurrence of sulfonamide and tetracycline resistance and their pollution profile in the aquaculture environment of Tianjin, northern China, were investigated. The presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was identified and the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were quantified at 6 aquaculture farms in Tianjin. Sulfonamide-resistance genes were prevalent and their concentrations were the highest detected (3.0 .. 10(-5) to 3.3 .. 10(-4) for sul1/16S rDNA, 2.0 .. 10(-4) to 1.8 .. 10(-3) for sul2/16S rDNA) among the various ARGs, most likely because the use of sulfonamides is more prevalent than tetracyclines in this area. Bacillus was the most dominant bacterial genus in both sulfamethoxazole resistant bacteria (63.27% of the total resistant bacteria) and tetracycline-resistant bacteria (57.14% of the total resistant bacteria).

We report the crystal structure of the FAD/NADPH-binding domain (FAD domain) of the biotechnologically important Bacillus megaterium flavocytochrome P450 BM3, the last domain of the enzyme to be structurally resolved. The structure was solved in both the absence and presence of the ligand NADP(+), identifying important protein interactions with the NADPH 2'-phosphate that helps to dictate specificity for NADPH over NADH, and involving residues Tyr974, Arg966, Lys972 and Ser965. The Trp1046 side chain shields the FAD isoalloxazine ring from NADPH, and motion of this residue is required to enable NADPH-dependent FAD reduction. Multiple binding interactions stabilize the FAD cofactor, including aromatic stacking with the adenine group from the side chains of Tyr860 and Trp854, and several interactions with FAD pyrophosphate oxygens, including bonding to tyrosines 828, 829 and 860.

22342191	10.1016/j.bioelechem.2012.01.006	Direct and mediated electrochemical response of the cytochrome P450 106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368.	CYP106A2 is one of only a few known steroid hydroxylases of bacterial origin, which might be interesting for biotechnological applications. Despite the enzyme having been studied for more than 30 years, its physiological function remains elusive. To date, there have been no reports of the redox potential of CYP106A2, which was supposed to be unusually low for a cytochrome P450. In this work we show that cyclic voltammetry is not only suitable to determine the redox potential of challenging proteins such as CYP106A2, measured at -128 mV vs. NHE, but also to study molecular interactions of the enzyme with different interaction partners via the respective electrochemical responses. The effect of small ligands, such as carbon monoxide and cyanide, was observed on the cyclic voltammograms of CYP106A2. Furthermore, we found that Tween 80 caused a positive shift of the redox potential of immobilised CYP106A2 indicative for water expulsion from the haem environment.

The soluble, catalytically self-sufficient cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium is a good candidate as biocatalyst for the synthesis of drug metabolites. To this end, error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to generate a library of P450 BM3 mutants with novel activities toward drugs. The double mutant Asp251Gly/Gln307His (A2) with activities towards diclofenac, ibuprofen and tolbutamide was identified by screening with the alkali method. This is based on the detection of NADPH oxidation during enzymatic turnover on whole Escherichia coli cells heterologously expressing the P450 BM3 mutants in the presence of the target substrates. The three drugs screened are marker substrates of human liver cytochromes P450 belonging to the 2C subfamily. Interestingly the mutations Asp251Gly/Gln307His are located on the protein surface and they are not directly involved in substrate binding and turnover.

Four isolates of Bacillus spp. were tested in a 2-year field study for biological control of pre- and postharvest diseases of apple. For the preharvest test, bacteria were applied to 'Golden Delicious' and 'Rome Beauty' trees in May or May and June. Foliar apple scab severity was assessed weekly. After harvest, fruit were wounded and then either left untreated or given a postharvest application of the bacteria. Wounded fruit were then inoculated with the bitter rot pathogen and lesion size was measured over 8 days. Bacillus megaterium isolate A3-6, B. mycoides isolate A1-1, and B. cereus isolate FLS-5 applied in May or May and June significantly reduced fruit and foliar apple scab severity in both years. A postharvest application of the bacteria (alone or in combination with a preharvest application) resulted in the greatest suppression of bitter rot on both cultivars (P &lt; 0.04).

The bacterial steroid-hydroxylase CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 hydroxylates a variety of 3-oxo-..-4-steroids and has recently been shown to catalyse regioselective hydroxylation of the diterpene abietic acid, as well as the pentacyclic triterpene 11-keto-..-boswellic acid. The broad substrate spectrum of this enzyme makes it an excellent candidate for biotechnological application. Because the natural substrate of this enzyme is not known, we assumed that the whole substrate spectrum might not yet be fully discovered. The difference spectroscopy method was used to screen a natural product library of 502 compounds. Screening of the library resulted in the identification of twelve hits, among them eight potential and four known substrates for CYP106A2. Interestingly, when testing the potential substrates, product formation was obtained only with triterpenes, namely dipterocarpol and betulin.

22252869	10.1128/IAI.06378-11	Identification of the cellular receptor of Clostridium spiroforme toxin.	Clostridium spiroforme produces the binary actin-ADP-ribosylating toxin CST (C. spiroforme toxin), which has been proposed to be responsible for diarrhea, enterocolitis, and eventually death, especially in rabbits. Here we report on the recombinant production of the enzyme component (CSTa) and the binding component (CSTb) of C. spiroforme toxin in Bacillus megaterium. By using the recombinant toxin components, we show that CST enters target cells via the lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (LSR), which has been recently identified as the host cell receptor of the binary toxins Clostridium difficile transferase (CDT) and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Microscopic studies revealed that CST, but not the related Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, colocalized with LSR during toxin uptake and traffic to endosomal compartments. Our findings indicate that CST shares LSR with C. difficile CDT and C. perfringens iota toxin as a host cell surface receptor.	2012	5	10	Infect Immun	Infection and immunity	ADP Ribose Transferases; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Toxins; Botulinum Toxins; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Line; Clostridioides difficile; Clostridium; Clostridium Infections; Enterotoxins; HeLa Cells; Humans; Protein Binding; Receptors, LDL; Recombinant Proteins	Papatheodorou	Panagiotis

In the present work the impact of large production scale was investigated for Bacillus megaterium expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Specifically designed scale-down studies, mimicking the intermittent and continuous nutrient supply of large- and small-scale processes, were carried out for this purpose. The recombinant strain revealed a 40% reduced GFP yield for the large-scale conditions. In line with extended carbon loss via formation of acetate and carbon dioxide, this indicated obvious limitations in the underlying metabolism of B. megaterium under the large-scale conditions. Quantitative analysis of intracellular amino acids via validated fast filtration protocols revealed that their level strongly differed between the two scenarios. During cultivation in large-scale set-up, the availability of most amino acids, serving as key building blocks of the recombinant protein, was substantially reduced.

Fourteen oxygenated compounds were isolated from the preparative-scale biotransformation of isostevic acid (ent-beyeran-19-oic acid). Incubation of it with Aspergillus niger BCRC 32720 produced eight metabolites, four with Bacillus megaterium ATCC 14581, and another four with Mortierella isabellina ATCC 38063. In addition to their structural elucidation by NMR spectroscopy and HRMS, structures of four of these were further confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies. Real-time reverse transcription PCR analysis found that 15 of these compounds displayed significant in vitro anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages by reducing the levels of both TNF-.. and COX-2 mRNA relative to control cells stimulated by LPS alone.

Cytochrome P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium is a monooxygenase with great potential for biotechnological applications. In this paper, we present engineered drug-metabolizing P450 BM3 mutants as a novel tool for regioselective hydroxylation of steroids at position 16... In particular, we show that by replacing alanine at position 82 with a tryptophan in P450 BM3 mutants M01 and M11, the selectivity toward 16..-hydroxylation for both testosterone and norethisterone was strongly increased. The A82W mutation led to a ...42-fold increase in V(max) for 16..-hydroxylation of these steroids. Moreover, this mutation improves the coupling efficiency of the enzyme, which might be explained by a more efficient exclusion of water from the active site. The substrate affinity for testosterone increased at least 9-fold in M11 with tryptophan at position 82. A change in the orientation of testosterone in the M11 A82W mutant as compared to the orientation in M11 was observed by T(1) paramagnetic relaxa	2012	3	9	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Alanine; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biotransformation; Catalytic Domain; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydroxylation; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Norethindrone; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Oxidation-Reduction; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Testosterone; Tryptophan	Rea	V

The flocculation of microorganisms plays a crucial role in bioreactors, and is substantially affected by pH. However, the mechanism for such an effect remains unclear. In this work, with an integrated approach, the pH dependence of structure and surface property of microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), excreted from Bacillus megaterium TF10, and accordingly its flocculation is elucidated. From the Fourier transform infrared spectra and acid-base titration test results, the main functional groups and buffering zones in the EPS responsible for the microbial flocculation are indentified. The laser light scattering analysis reveals that the deprotonated or protonated states of these functional groups in EPS result in more dense and compact structure at a lower pH because of hydrophobicity and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The zeta potential measurements identify the isoelectric point and indicate that the electrostatic repulsion action of EPS is controlled by pH.

24389272	10.1016/j.peptides.2013.12.012	Genomic and functional characterization of three new venom peptides from the scorpion Heterometrus spinifer.	Three new cysteine-free venom peptides, which are referred to as Heterin-1, Heterin-2 and Spiniferin, respectively, were identified from the scorpion Heterometrus spinifer. Heterin-1, Heterin-2 and Spiniferin contain 43, 24 and 13 amino acid residues, respectively. Genomic analysis showed that the genomic organizations of the three peptides are consistent with those of the known Na(+), K(+) or Cl(-)-channel specific toxins from scorpions; this suggests that the genes of the cysteine-free and cysteine-rich peptides from scorpions were derived from a common ancestor. Antimicrobial assay demonstrated that Heterin-1 possesses potent activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Among the tested bacterial species, Heterin-1 is the most active against Bacillus megaterium and Micrococcus luteus with MICs of 4.0 ..M and 4.0 ..M, respectively.

Previous work demonstrated that Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spores that are null for the sleB and cwlJ genes, which encode cortex-lytic enzymes (CLEs), either of which is required for efficient cortex hydrolysis in Bacillus spores, could germinate efficiently when complemented with a plasmid-borne copy of ypeB plus the nonlytic portion of sleB encoding the N-terminal domain of SleB (sleB(N)). The current study demonstrates that the defective germination phenotype of B. megaterium sleB cwlJ spores can partially be restored when they are complemented with plasmid-borne ypeB alone. However, efficient germination in this genetic background requires the presence of sleL, which in this species was suggested previously to encode a nonlytic epimerase.

During growth on crystalline cellulose, the thermophilic bacterium Caldicellulosiruptor bescii secretes several cellulose-degrading enzymes. Among these enzymes is CelA (CbCel9A/Cel48A), which is reported as the most highly secreted cellulolytic enzyme in this bacterium. CbCel9A/Cel48A is a large multi-modular polypeptide, composed of an N-terminal catalytic glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GH9) module and a C-terminal GH48 catalytic module that are separated by a family 3c carbohydrate-binding module (CBM3c) and two identical CBM3bs. The wild-type CbCel9A/Cel48A and its truncational mutants were expressed in Bacillus megaterium and Escherichia coli, respectively. The wild-type polypeptide released twice the amount of glucose equivalents from Avicel than its truncational mutant that lacks the GH48 catalytic module. The truncational mutant harboring the GH9 module and the CBM3c was more thermostable than the wild-type protein, likely due to its compact structure.

The effectiveness of autochthonous plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria was studied in Lavandula dentata and Salvia officinalis growing in a natural arid Mediterranean soil under drought conditions. These bacteria identified as Bacillus megaterium (Bm), Enterobacter sp. (E), Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and Bacillus sp. (Bsp). Each bacteria has different potential to meliorate water limitation and alleviating drought stress in these two plant species. B. thuringiensis promoted growth and drought avoidance in Lavandula by increasing K content, by depressing stomatal conductance, and it controlled shoot proline accumulation. This bacterial effect on increasing drought tolerance was related to the decrease of glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) that resulted sensitive indexes of lower cellular oxidative damage involved in the adaptative drought response in B. thuringiensis-inoculated Lavandula plants.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing Bacillus strains express class IV PHA synthase, which is composed of the subunits PhaR and PhaC. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing PHA synthase from Bacillus cereus strain YB-4 (PhaRCYB-4) showed an unusual reduction of the molecular weight of PHA produced during the stationary phase of growth. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the low-molecular-weight PHA revealed that its carboxy end structure was capped by ethanol, suggesting that the molecular weight reduction was the result of alcoholytic cleavage of PHA chains by PhaRCYB-4 induced by endogenous ethanol. This scission reaction was also induced by exogenous ethanol in both in vivo and in vitro assays. In addition, PhaRCYB-4 was observed to have alcoholysis activity for PHA chains synthesized by other synthases.

Site-directed mutagenesis of an ..-amylase isolated from Bacillus megaterium WHO has been performed to evaluate the roles of the calcium binding site residues in enzyme thermostability. The strategy used was to replace residues in the hypothetical calcium binding loops of B. megaterium WHO ..-amylase (BMW-amylase) by equivalent positions at Halothermothrix orenii ..-amylase (AmyA) as a thermophilic amylase by QuikChange site directed mutagenesis. Asn-75, Ser-76, and His-77 were mutated in the second calcium binding site which resulted in an increase in thermostability. All mutants retained their hydrolytic activity although their kcat parameter decreased in compare to the wild type and in the presence of calcium ions. In S76P and H77E, the Km for starch decreases while overall activity (kcat/Km) was increased. In the presence of calcium, conversion of His-77 to Glu resulted in a 4-fold enhancement in enzyme half life and a 9..C upward shift in T50, which was observed in compare to the 	2014	8	13	Enzyme Microb Technol	Enzyme and microbial technology	Bacillus megaterium; Calcium; Mutagenesis; Thermostability; ..-Amylase; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Binding Sites; Calcium; Enzyme Stability; Half-Life; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutant Proteins; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Temperature; alpha-Amylases	Ghollasi	Marzieh
24315638	10.1016/j.enzmictec.2013.08.001	Significant improvement of thermal stability of glucose 1-dehydrogenase by introducing disulfide bonds at the tetramer interface.	Rational design was applied to glucose 1-dehydrogenase (LsGDH) from Lysinibacillus sphaericus G10 to improve its thermal stability by introduction of disulfide bridges between subunits. One out of the eleven mutants, designated as DS255, displayed significantly enhanced thermal stability with considerable soluble expression and high specific activity. It was extremely stable at pH ranging from 4.5 to 10.5, as it retained nearly 100% activity after incubating at different buffers for 1h. Mutant DS255 also exhibited high thermostability, having a half-life of 9900min at 50..C, which was 1868-fold as that of its wild type. Moreover, both of the increased free energy of denaturation and decreased entropy of denaturation of DS255 suggested that the enzyme structure was stabilized by the engineered disulfide bonds. On account of its robust stability, mutant DS255 would be a competitive candidate in practical applications of chiral chemicals synthesis, biofuel cells and glucose biosensors. 	2014	8	13	Enzyme Microb Technol	Enzyme and microbial technology	BmGDH-IWG3; Disulfide bond; GDH; GDH from Bacillus megaterium IWG3; GDH from Lysinibacillus sphaericus G10; Glucose 1-dehydrogenase; LsGDH; NAD; NAD(P)-dependent glucose 1-dehydrogenase; NADP; Protein engineering; Protein stability; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; Bacillaceae; Bacterial Proteins; Cysteine; Disulfides; Enzyme Stability; Glucose 1-Dehydrogenase; Half-Life; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Denaturation; Protein Engineering; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Subunits; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology; Temperature	Ding	Haitao

24274794	10.1021/ja4107226	Cyclization of squalene from both termini: identification of an onoceroid synthase and enzymatic synthesis of ambrein.	The onoceroids are triterpenoids biosynthesized from squalene or (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene by cyclization from both termini. We recently revealed that tetraprenyl-..-curcumene cyclase from Bacillus megaterium (BmeTC) is a bifunctional triterpene/sesquarterpene cyclase that converts head-to-tail tetraprenyl-..-curcumene and tail-to-tail squalene into pentacyclic and bicyclic products, respectively, in vivo. Here, we reveal that BmeTC has an unprecedented catalytic function in cyclizing squalene from both termini and is the first onoceroid synthase. We also report the first onoceroids from bacterial origin. Our discoveries suggest that symmetric and asymmetric onoceroids could be biosynthesized by a single enzyme via an intermediate cyclized at one terminus of squalene. Furthermore, the new function of BmeTC enabled the synthesis of (+)-ambrein, a major constituent of ambergris that is difficult to obtain naturally, via a mutated squalene-hopene cyclase-catalyzed reaction from easily availa	2014	7	23	J Am Chem Soc	Journal of the American Chemical Society	Cyclization; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Ligases; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Naphthols; Squalene; Triterpenes	Ueda	Daijiro

Anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) are antimicrobial peptides with binding and neutralizing activities to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in crustaceans. This study identified and characterized a novel ALF homolog (SpALF4) from the mud crab Scylla paramamosain. The complete cDNA of SpALF4 had 756..bp with a 381..bp open reading frame encoding a protein with 126..aa. The deduced protein contained a signal peptide and a LPS-binding domain. SpALF4 shared the highest identity with PtALF5 at amino acid level but exhibited low similarity with most of other crustacean ALFs. Furthermore, different from the previously identified three SpALF homologs and most of other ALFs, SpALF4 had a low isoelectric point (pI) for the mature peptide and the LPS-binding domain with the values of 6.93 and 6.74, respectively. These results indicate that SpALF4 may be a unique ALF homolog with special biological function in the mud crab.

24222222	10.4238/2013.October.10.8	Bioprospection of bacteria and yeasts from Atlantic Rainforest soil capable of growing in crude-glycerol residues.	The increasing world production of biodiesel has resulted in an accumulation of crude glycerol as the major byproduct. This could be used as carbon source for industrial microbiology, with economic and environmental advantages for the biodiesel industry. We explored an Atlantic Rainforest soil sample to search for crude glycerol-degrading microorganisms. Microcosms of this soil were established containing minimal medium + 8% crude glycerol (w/w); the biological activity was measured by respirometry. High CO2 levels were found in some of the crude glycerol microcosms, suggesting the activity of microorganisms capable of degrading this residue. In an attempt to isolate and cultivate these microorganisms in vitro, aliquots of the soil suspension were plated on minimal medium containing 10% crude glycerol (v/v). Out of 19 morphologically distinct isolates, 12 bacteria and 6 yeasts were identified by PCR from universal primers 16S and 26S rDNA, respectively.

Leucrocin I is an antibacterial peptide isolated from crocodile (Crocodylus siamensis) white blood cell extracts. Based on Leucrocin I sequence, cationic peptide, NY15, was designed, synthesized and evaluated for antibacterial activity against Bacillus sphaericus TISTR 678, Bacillus megaterium (clinical isolate), Vibrio cholerae (clinical isolate), Salmonella typhi (clinical isolate), Salmonella typhi ATCC 5784 and Escherichia coli 0157:H7. The efficacy of the peptide made from all L-amino acids was also compared with all D-amino acids. The peptide made from all D-amino acids was more active than the corresponding L-enantiomer. In our detailed study, the interaction between peptides and the cell membrane of Vibrio cholerae as part of their killing mechanism was studied by fluorescence and electron microscopy. The results show that the membrane was the target of action of the peptides.

Commercial production of 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG), the immediate precursor of l-ascorbic acid, is by Ketogulonicigenium vulgare in co-culture with Bacillus megaterium. We used flux balance analysis (FBA) to study a genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of K. vulgare, iWZ663, and found that K. vulgare is deficient in nutrient biosynthetic pathways. Individually omitting l-glycine, l-cysteine, l-methionine, l-tryptophan, adenine, thymine, thiamine and pantothenate from complete chemically defined medium (CDM), caused biomass formation of K. vulgare to decrease to 1%, 21%, 16%, 1%, 26%, 57%, 73% and 24%, respectively. Based on these results and FBA, a minimal chemically defined medium (MCDM) was developed that supported monoculture of K. vulgare (0.28OD600) and 2-KLG production (3.59g/L), which were similar to those in complete CDM or corn steep liquor powder (CSLP) medium.

To further our understanding of the virulence potential of Bacillus megaterium strains, cell association and invasion assays were conducted in vitro by infecting human enterocytes (Caco-2 cells) with 53 strains of this bacterium isolated from honey. Two series of experiments were performed: (i) necrosis and cell detachment assays with the supernatants of bacterial culture filtrates from 16-h cultures and (ii) adhesion/invasion assays in which cultured enterocytes incubated with bacteria from 3-h cultures were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and chloramphenicol. The detachment of Caco-2 cells was evaluated by staining the cells with crystal violet. Necrosis was assessed by fluorescence microscopy of cells labeled with propidium iodide. Association (adhesion plus invasion) was determined by plate counts and invasion in an aminoglycoside protection assay. The results showed that spent culture supernatants detached and necrotized Caco-2 cells in a strain-dependent manner.	2013	12	5	Int Microbiol	International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Adhesion; Caco-2 Cells; Enterocytes; Honey; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Necrosis; Species Specificity; Virulence	L..pez	Ana C
24115473	10.1002/cbic.201300386	A single mutation at the ferredoxin binding site of P450 Vdh enables efficient biocatalytic production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3).	Vitamin D3 hydroxylase (Vdh) from Pseudonocardia autotrophica is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the two-step hydroxylation of vitamin D3 (VD3 ) to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)VD3 ) and 1..,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1..,25(OH)2 VD3 ). These hydroxylated forms of VD3 are useful as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of conditions associated with VD3 deficiency and VD3 metabolic disorder. Herein, we describe the creation of a highly active T107A mutant of Vdh by engineering the putative ferredoxin-binding site. Crystallographic and kinetic analyses indicate that the T107A mutation results in conformational change from an open to a closed state, thereby increasing the binding affinity with ferredoxin. We also report the efficient biocatalytic synthesis of 25(OH)VD3 , a promising intermediate for the synthesis of various hydroxylated VD3 derivatives, by using nisin-treated Rhodococcus erythropolis cells containing VdhT107A .

Siderophore production by Bacillus megaterium was detected, in an iron-deficient culture medium, during the exponential growth phase, prior to the sporulation, in the presence of glucose; these results suggested that the onset of siderophore production did not require glucose depletion and was not related with the sporulation. The siderophore production by B. megaterium was affected by the carbon source used. The growth on glycerol promoted the very high siderophore production (1,182 ..mol g(-1) dry weight biomass); the opposite effect was observed in the presence of mannose (251 ..mol g(-1) dry weight biomass). The growth in the presence of fructose, galactose, glucose, lactose, maltose or sucrose, originated similar concentrations of siderophore (546-842 ..mol g(-1) dry weight biomass).

24085394	10.1007/s00253-013-5251-9	Basic studies on the role of components of Bacillus megaterium as flotation biocollectors in sulphide mineral separation.	Studies were carried out to assess the utility of the cellular and extracellular constituents of Bacillus megaterium for the flotation of sphalerite and galena minerals. Based on the flotation results on the individual minerals, it was observed that sphalerite was preferentially floated compared to galena. A maximum selectivity index (SI) value of 11.7 was achieved in the presence of the soluble fraction of the thermolysed cells, which was higher than that obtained with the intact cells (SI of 6.5) and the insoluble fraction of the thermolysed cells (SI of 9.6). The results of the various enzymatic treatment tests revealed that extracellular DNA played a vital role in the selective flotation of sphalerite. A noteworthy finding was that the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) had a higher biocollector capacity vis-..-vis the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), leading to better flotation efficiency. About 95 % recovery of sphalerite could be achieved from the mineral mixture by the combined addition o	2014	10	15	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Chemical Fractionation; DNA, Bacterial; Lead; Minerals; Sulfides; Zinc Compounds	Vasanthakumar	Balasubramanian

24061559	10.1007/s00775-013-1034-0	The mechanism of copper uptake by tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium.	Tyrosinase belongs to the type..3 copper enzyme family, containing a dinuclear copper center, CuA and CuB. It is mainly responsible for melanin production in a wide range of organisms. Although copper ions are essential for the activity of tyrosinase, the mechanism of copper uptake is still unclear. We have recently determined the crystal structure of tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (TyrBm) and revealed that this enzyme has tighter binding of CuA in comparison with CuB. Investigating copper accumulation in TyrBm, we found that the presence of copper has a more significant effect on the diphenolase activity. By decreasing the concentration of copper, we increased the diphenolase to monophenolase activity ratio twofold. Using a rational design approach, we identified five variants having an impact on copper uptake. We have found that a major role of the highly conserved Asn205 residue is to stabilize the orientation of the His204 imidazole ring in the binding site, thereby promoting 	2014	6	25	J Biol Inorg Chem	Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Binding Sites; Copper; Crystallography, X-Ray; Models, Molecular; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Oxidoreductases; Point Mutation; Protein Conformation	Kanteev	Margarita
24053016		The effectiveness of photocatalytic ionisation disinfection of filter materials.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of photocatalytic ionisation as a disinfection method for filter materials contaminated by microorganisms, and to assess how air relative humidity (RH), time and microbe type influence the effectiveness of this disinfection. In the quantitative analysis of a used car air filter, bacterial contamination equalled 1.2 x 10(5) cfu/cm2, fungal contamination was 3.8 x 10(6) cfu/cm2, and the isolated microorganisms were Aspergillus niger, Bacillus megaterium, Cladosporium herbarum, Cryptococcus laurenti, Micrococcus sp., Rhodotorula glutinis and Staphylococcus cohnii. In the model experiment, three isolates (C. herbarum, R. glutinis, S. cohnii) and 3 ATCC species (A. niger, E. coli, S. aureus) were used for photocatalytic ionisation disinfection.

Electrochemical methods continue to present an attractive means for achieving in vitro biocatalysis with cytochromes P450; however understanding fully the nature of electrode-bound P450 remains elusive. Herein we report thermodynamic parameters using electrochemical analysis of full-length mammalian microsomal cytochrome P450 2B4 (CYP 2B4) in didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) surfactant films. Electronic absorption spectra of CYP 2B4-DDAB films on silica slides reveal an absorption maximum at 418nm, characteristic of low-spin, six-coordinate, water-ligated Fe(III) heme in P450. The Fe(III/II) and Fe(II/I) redox couples (E1/2) of substrate-free CYP 2B4 measured by cyclic voltammetry are -0.23V and -1.02V (vs. SCE, or 14mV and -776mV vs. NHE) at 21..C.

Oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB), contains abundant cellulose and hemicelluloses and can be used as a renewable resource for fuel and chemical production. This study, as the first attempt, aims to convert OPEFB derived sugars to polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). OPEFB collected from a Malaysia palm oil refinery plant was chemically pretreated and enzymatically hydrolyzed by an in-house prepared cellulase cocktail. The PHB producer, Bacillus megaterium R11, was isolated in Singapore and could accumulate PHB up to 51.3% of its cell dry weight (CDW) from both glucose and xylose. Tryptone was identified as its best nitrogen source. PHB content and production reached 58.5% and 9.32 g/L, respectively, for an overall OPEFB sugar concentration of 45 g/L. These respectively reached 51.6% and 12.48 g/L for OPEFB hydrolysate containing 60 g/L sugar with a productivity of 0.260 g/L/h.	2014	4	30	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium R11; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Oil palm empty fruit bunch; Polyhydroxybutyrate; Xylose; Arecaceae; Bacillus megaterium; Butyrates; Culture Media; Polyhydroxyalkanoates	Zhang	Youhong
24001447	10.1016/j.colsurfb.2013.07.034	Microbially induced selective flotation of sphalerite from galena using mineral-adapted strains of Bacillus megaterium.	The selective flotation of sphalerite from a sphalerite-galena mineral mixture has been achieved using cells and extracellular secretions of Bacillus megaterium after adaptation to the chosen minerals. The extracellular secretions obtained after thermolysis of bacterial cells adapted to sphalerite yield the highest flotation recovery of sphalerite with a selectivity index value of 24.5, in comparison to the other cellular and extra-cellular bio-reagents studied. The protein profile for the unadapted and mineral-adapted cells has been found to differ distinctly, attesting to variation in the yield and nature of extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS). The changes induced in the bacterial cell wall components after adaptation to sphalerite or galena with respect to the contents of phosphate, uronic acid and acetylated sugars of B. megaterium have been quantified.

It has been known for the past 20 years that two pathways exist in nature for the de novo biosynthesis of the coenzyme form of vitamin B12, adenosylcobalamin, representing aerobic and anaerobic routes. In contrast to the aerobic pathway, the anaerobic route has remained enigmatic because many of its intermediates have proven technically challenging to isolate, because of their inherent instability. However, by studying the anaerobic cobalamin biosynthetic pathway in Bacillus megaterium and using homologously overproduced enzymes, it has been possible to isolate all of the intermediates between uroporphyrinogen III and cobyrinic acid. Consequently, it has been possible to detail the activities of purified cobinamide biosynthesis (Cbi) proteins CbiF, CbiG, CbiD, CbiJ, CbiET, and CbiC, as well as show the direct in vitro conversion of 5-aminolevulinic acid into cobyrinic acid using a mixture of 14 purified enzymes.

Western blotting, protein sequence analysis, and enzyme activity measurement confirmed the expression. The enzymatic activity of 3-OST-1 expressed in Bacillus species were found to be similar to those found when expressed in Escherichia coli. The endotoxin level in 3-OST-1 from B. subtilis and B. megaterium were 10(4)-10(5)-fold lower than that of the E. coli-expressed 3-OST-1, which makes the Bacillus expression system of particular interest for the generation of pharmaceutical grade raw heparin from nonanimal sources.	2014	4	11	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Endotoxins; Sulfotransferases	Wang	Wenya

A novel two-helper-strain co-culture system (TSCS) was developed to enhance 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KLG) productivity for vitamin C production. Bacillus megaterium and B. cereus (with a seeding culture ratio of 1:3, v/v), used as helper strains, increased the 2-KLG yield using Ketogulonigenium vulgare compared to the conventional one-helper-strain (either B. cereus or B. megaterium) co-culture system (OSCS). After 45 h cultivation, 2-KLG concentration in the TSCS (69 g l(-1)) increased by 8.9 and 7 % over that of the OSCS (B. cereus: 63.4 g l(-1); B. megaterium: 64.5 g l(-1)). The fermentation period of TSCS was 4 h shorter than that of OSCS (B. cereus). The increased cell numbers of K. vulgare stimulated by the two helper strains possibly explain the enhanced 2-KLG yield. The results imply that TSCS is a viable method for enhancing industrial production of 2-KLG.	2014	5	5	Biotechnol Lett	Biotechnology letters	Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Fermentation; Rhodobacteraceae; Sugar Acids; Time Factors	Mandlaa	Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 72 Wenhua Road, Shenyang, 110016, China, mandlaa@foxmail

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) have enormous potential in the production of oxychemicals, due to their unparalleled regio- and stereoselectivity. The Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 enzyme is a key model system, with several mutants (many distant from the active site) reported to alter substrate selectivity. It has the highest reported monooxygenase activity of the P450 enzymes, and this catalytic efficiency has inspired protein engineering to enable its exploitation for biotechnologically relevant oxidations with structurally diverse substrates. However, a structural rationale is lacking to explain how these mutations have such effects in the absence of direct change to the active site architecture. Here, we provide the first crystal structures of BM3 mutants in complex with a human drug substrate, the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole.

The SOS response, a mechanism enabling bacteria to cope with DNA damage, is strictly regulated by the two major players, RecA and LexA (Bacillus homologue DinR). Genetic stress provokes formation of ssDNA-RecA nucleoprotein filaments, the coprotease activity of which mediates the autocatalytic cleavage of the transcriptional repressor DinR and ensures the expression of a set of din (damage-inducible) genes, which encode proteins that enhance repair capacity, accelerate mutagenesis rate and cause inhibition of cell division (ICD). In Bacillus subtilis, the transcriptional activation of the yneAB-ynzC operon is part of the SOS response, with YneA being responsible for the ICD. Pointing to its cellular function in Bacillus megaterium, overexpression of homologous YneA led to filamentous growth, while ICD was temporary during the SOS response.

In the two-step vitamin C fermentation process, the precursor 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG) was synthesized using a mixed culture of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare WSH-001 and Bacillus megaterium WSH-002, which contained three plasmids, pBME1, pBME2 and pBME3. The cell growth of B. megaterium was not affected by the elimination of these plasmids. However, elimination of pBME2 and pBME3 significantly affected l-sorbose uptake and 2-KLG production. Sequence analysis of the plasmids showed that many of the pBME2 and pBME3 genes were of unknown function or could not be assigned to a specific metabolic pathway. The current work showed that the indigenous plasmids pBME2 and pBME3 of B. megaterium WSH-002 involved in mutualism with K. vulgare WSH-001. The results provided a promising new route to further demonstrate the mutualism process between the two bacteria. 	2014	2	18	Plasmid	Plasmid	2-Keto-l-gulonic acid; Plasmid elimination; Symbiosis; Vitamin C; l-ascorbic acid; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacillus megaterium; Base Sequence; Computational Biology; DNA Primers; Genes, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sugar Acids; Symbiosis	Zhou	Jingwen

Microbial levan, a natural polymer of fructose, was produced and purified by alcohol precipitation from culture supernatants of Bacillus megaterium type 1 grown in an optimized liquid sucrose medium. GPC analysis showed that the yield of the major fraction of levan having molecular weight ~5000 D increased with increase in sucrose concentration in the broth. Levan subjected to (60)Co-gamma radiation as well as acid hydrolysis was investigated by rheometry, UV-visible spectrophotometry and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) techniques. Unlike most of the polysaccharides, levan powder exhibited good radiation degradation stability up to 150 kGy. Gamma irradiation of 10% levan aqueous solution at 250 kGy yielded 63.0% fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) with an average molecular weight of 1250 D. Acid hydrolysis of levan using 0.5 N HCl for 60 min treatment time gave rise to the desired FOS with lower yield (23.1%) as compared to that obtained in gamma radiolysis process.	2013	12	23	Carbohydr Polym	Carbohydrate polymers	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Load; Fructans; Gamma Rays; Oligosaccharides; Particle Size; Viscosity	Jalan	N

Caesalpinia bonducella is an important medicinal plant for its traditional uses against different types of diseases. Therefore, the present study investigated the antimicrobial, antidiarrhoeal, and cytotoxic activities of the methanol extract and ethyl acetate, chloroform, and petroleum ether (pet. ether) fractions of C. bonducella leaves. The antibacterial potentialities of methanol extract and its fractions of C. bonducella leaves were investigated by the disc diffusion method against four gram-positive and five gram-negative bacteria at 300, 500 and 800 ..g/disc. Kanamycin (30 ..g/disc) was used as the standard drug. Antidiarrhoeal activities of leaf extracts were evaluated at two doses (200 and 400 mg/kg) and compared with loperamide in a castor oil-induced diarrhoeal model in rat. The fractions were subjected to a brine shrimp lethality test to evaluate their cytotoxicity. The methanol extract and other three fractions exhibited better activities at higher concentrations.

Daqu, a traditional fermentation starter, has been used to produce attractively flavored foods such as vinegar and Chinese liquor for thousands of years. Although Bacillus spp. are one of the dominant microorganisms in Daqu, more precise information is needed to reveal why and how Bacillus became dominant in Daqu, and next, to assess the impact of Bacillus sp. on Daqu and its derived products. We combined culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to study the ecology of Bacillus during Daqu incubation. Throughout the incubation, 67 presumptive Bacillus spp. isolates were obtained, 52 of which were confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing. The identified organisms belonged to 8 Bacillus species: B. licheniformis, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. cereus, B. circulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, and B. anthracis. A primer set specific for Bacillus and related genera was used in a selective PCR study, followed by a nested DGGE PCR targeting the V9 region of the 16S rDNA.

23625848	10.1128/JB.00325-13	Investigating the functional hierarchy of Bacillus megaterium PV361 spore germinant receptors.	Spores of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 germinate rapidly when exposed to a number of single-trigger germinant compounds, including glucose, proline, leucine, and certain inorganic salts. However, spores of strain PV361, a plasmidless QM B1551 derivative that lacks the GerU germinant receptor (GR) responsible for mediating germination in response to single-trigger compounds, can germinate efficiently when incubated in nutritionally rich media, presumably via activation of additional germinant receptors. In this work, we have identified five chromosomally encoded GRs and attempted to characterize, by mutational analysis, germinant recognition profiles associated with the respective receptors in strain PV361. Of strains engineered with single GR insertion-deletions, only GerK-null spores displayed significant defective germination phenotypes when incubated in 5% (wt/vol) beef extract or plated on rich solid medium.

23625846	10.1128/JB.00257-13	Identification of new proteins that modulate the germination of spores of bacillus species.	A number of operons encoding the nutrient germinant receptors (GRs) in dormant spores of Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis species have small open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function within or immediately adjacent to the operons. Inactivation of the genes in these ORFs, encoding proteins now termed D proteins, either significantly increased or decreased spore germination via the associated GR but had no effects on germination via non-GR-dependent germinants. These effects on GR-dependent germination were complemented by ectopic expression of the appropriate D gene (gene encoding D protein). However, substitution of noncognate D genes in two GR operons resulted in inhibition of germination via the GR manipulated, although ectopic overexpression of a D gene had no effect on overall GR-dependent germination. The various D genes studied were expressed in the forespore during sporulation in parallel with the associated GR operon, and transcription of a B. subtilis D gene was c	2013	8	16	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Operon; Spores, Bacterial	Ramirez-Peralta	Arturo

At both 50 and 90..C production of RS by NP-PL was almost twofold greater than that by untreated pectate lyase (PL) from each of the three peels. The optimal production of RS from banana and citrus peels were after 24 and 6h of incubation while it was 24 and 4h for potato peels at 50 and 90..C, respectively, on NP-PL treatment. NP-PL could degum raw, decorticated ramie fibers as well as enhance fiber tenacity and fineness. The weight loss of the fibers were 24% and 31% better (compared to PL treatment) after 24 and 48 h of processing.

This treatment resulted in slightly greater yield than oilseed rape meal without strain A6 in 1 of 2 experiments, suggesting a role for strain A6 in improving yield. Strain A6 was capable of solubilizing phosphorus from rock phosphate in liquid culture and produced enzymes capable of mineralizing organic phosphorus (acid phosphatase, phytase) in liquid culture and in the biological fertilizer.

Extrachromosomal DNA maintenance (EDM) is an important process in molecular breeding and for various applications in the construction of genetically engineered microbes. Here we describe a novel Bacillus subtilis gene involved in EDM function called edmS (formerly pgsE). Functional gene regions were identified using molecular genetics techniques. We found that EdmS is a membrane-associated protein that is crucial for EDM. We also determined that EdmS can change a plasmid vector with an unstable replicon and worse-than-random segregation into one with better-than-random segregation, suggesting that the protein functions in the declustering and/or partitioning of episomes. EdmS has two distinct domains: an N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain and a C-terminal assembly accelerator-like structure, and mutational analysis of edmS revealed that both domains are essential for EDM.

Biofertilizers are used to improve soil fertility and plant production in sustainable agriculture. However, their applicability depends on several environmental parameters. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of free-living bacteria containing fertilizer on the growth of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L. cvs. Delicates) under aluminium (Al) stress. Different responses to Al stress of cucumber growth parameters were examined in terms of root elongation and physiological traits, such as Spad index (relative chlorophyll value), biomass accumulation of root and shoot, Al uptake and selected element contents (Fe, Mn, Zn, Mg) of leaves and root. The applied bacteria containing biofertilizer contains Azotobacter chroococcum and Bacillus megaterium. The dry weights of cucumber shoots and roots decreased in line with the increasing Al concentration.

Germination of Bacillus spores requires degradation of a modified layer of peptidoglycan (PG) termed the spore cortex by two redundant cortex-lytic enzymes (CLEs), CwlJ and SleB, plus SleB's partner protein, YpeB. In this study, in vitro and in vivo analyses have been used to clarify the roles of individual SleB and YpeB domains in PG degradation. Purified mature Bacillus cereus SleB without its signal sequence (SleB(M)) and the SleB C-terminal catalytic domain (SleB(C)) efficiently triggered germination of decoated Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis spores lacking endogenous CLEs; previously, SleB's N-terminal domain (SleB(N)) was shown to bind PG but have no enzymatic activity. YpeB lacking its putative membrane anchoring sequence (YpeB(M)) or its N- and C-terminal domains (YpeB(N) and YpeB(C)) alone did not exhibit degradative activity, but YpeB(N) inhibited SleB(M) and SleB(C) activity in vitro.

23457476	10.1371/journal.pone.0055708	Bacillus megaterium has both a functional BluB protein required for DMB synthesis and a related flavoprotein that forms a stable radical species.	Despite the extensive study of the biosynthesis of the complex molecule B12 (cobalamin), the mechanism by which the lower ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) is formed has remained something of a mystery. However, recent work has identified and characterized a DMB-synthase (BluB) responsible for the oxygen-dependent, single enzyme conversion of FMN to DMB. In this work, we have identified BluB homologs from the aerobic purple, nonsulfur, photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus and the aerobic soil bacterium Bacillus megaterium and have demonstrated DMB synthesis by the use of a novel complementation assay in which a B12 deficient strain, substituted with the precursor cobinamide is recovered either by the addition of DMB or by the recombinant expression of a bluB gene. The DMB-synthetic activity of the purified recombinant BluB enzymes was further confirmed in vitro by providing the enzyme with FMNH2 and oxygen and observing the formation of DMB by HPLC.

23454894	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2013.01.019	Reconstruction and analysis of the industrial strain Bacillus megaterium WSH002 genome-scale in silico metabolic model.	A genome-scale metabolic model of Bacillus megaterium WSH002, an industrial bacterium widely used in the vitamin C industry, was reconstructed on the basis of the genome annotation and data from the literature and biochemical databases. It comprises 1112 reactions, 993 metabolites, and 1055 genes, including 43 new annotated genes. This model was able to predict qualitatively and quantitatively the growth of B. megaterium on a range of carbon and nitrogen sources, and the results agreed well with experimental data. A gene essentiality analysis predicted a core metabolic essential gene set of 57 genes on three different media. Furthermore, constraint-based analysis revealed that B. megaterium WSH002 is capable of producing and exporting several key metabolites, which could promote the growth of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG) production. Here, the model represents a helpful tool for understanding and exploring this important industrial organism.	2013	10	25	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacteriological Techniques; Biomass; Carbon; Coculture Techniques; Computer Simulation; Genome, Bacterial; Industrial Microbiology; Metabolomics; Models, Biological; Nitrogen; Rhodobacteraceae	Zou	Wei

In this work technical and economic analyses were performed to evaluate the glycerol transformation into Polyhydroxybutyrate using Bacillus megaterium. The production of PHB was compared using glycerol or glucose as substrates and similar yields were obtained. The total production costs for PHB generation with both substrates were estimated at an industrial scale. Compared to glucose, glycerol showed a 10% and 20% decrease in the PHB production costs using two different separation schemes respectively. Moreover, a 20% profit margin in the PHB sales price using glycerol as substrate resulted in a 166% valorization of crude glycerol. In this work, the feasibility of glycerol as feedstock for the production of PHB at laboratory (up to 60% PHB accumulation) and industrial (2.6US$/kgPHB) scales is demonstrated.	2013	10	17	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Biomass; Biopolymers; Biotechnology; Computer Simulation; Fermentation; Glucose; Glycerol; Hydroxybutyrates; Industrial Waste	Naranjo	Javier M

The suicide inactivation is a common phenomenon observed for heme peroxidases, in which the enzyme is inactivated as a result of self-oxidation mediated by highly oxidizing enzyme intermediates formed during the catalytic cycle. The selected model was a mutant comprising only the heme domain (CYPBM3 21B3) that had been previously evolved to efficiently catalyze hydroxylation reactions with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as electron acceptor. An extensive mapping of residues involved in electron transfer routes was obtained from density functional calculations on activated heme (i.e. Compound I) and selected amino acid residues. Identification of oxidizable residues (electron donors) was performed by selectively activating/deactivating different quantum regions.

23417777	10.1002/jobm.201200128	Native soil bacteria isolates in Mexico exhibit a promising antagonistic effect against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici.	Sinaloa state accounts for 23% of Mexico's tomato production. One constraint on this important crop is the Fusarium crown and root rot, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici, which has been reported to reduce crop yield by up to 50%. In this study, we set out to identify bacterial populations which could be used to control this disease through natural antagonism. Five tomato rhizospheric soil samples were collected, dried for 1-week, and homogenized. Sub-samples were used to prepare an aqueous solution used to isolate microorganisms in pure cultures. Organisms were purified and grown separately, and used to generate a collection of 705 bacterial isolates. Thirty-four percent from this bank (254 strains) was screened against Forl, finding 27 bacteria displaying in vitro Forl growth inhibition levels from 5% to 60%. These isolates belonged to the genus Bacillus and their 16Sr DNA sequences showed that they are closely related to seven species and they were putatively de	2015	7	9	J Basic Microbiol	Journal of basic microbiology	Bacterial antagonism; FCRRT; Forl; Microorganism collection; Native bacteria; Acinetobacter; Antibiosis; Bacillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus thuringiensis; Fusarium; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mexico; Pest Control, Biological; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Soil Microbiology	Cordero-Ram..rez	Jes..s Dami..n

Ketogulonicigenium vulgare is used widely during the industrial production of 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG), the precursor of vitamin C, in a coculture with Bacillus megaterium. We analyzed the sulfate and coenzyme A metabolic module in the genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) iWZ663 and found that the poor growth of K. vulgare was due to a deficiency in key reductases in the sulfate metabolic pathway. To carefully investigate the metabolism of sulfate, we developed a chemically defined medium (CDM) to produce pure cultures of K. vulgare. The addition of glutathione and l-cysteine to a flask culture of K. vulgare increased the cell growth, 2-KLG titer, and the intracellular coenzyme A level by 38.7%, 45.5%, and 85.3%, respectively, with glutathione, and by 25.6%, 35.8%, and 44.7%, respectively, with l-cysteine. The addition of glutathione to a 7-L fermenter culture of K. vulgare and B. megaterium increased the 2-KLG productivity by 20.9%.

The aim of this research was production of polyphosphate (poly P) and study on its antibacterial effects. Poly P granules in the cells were observed with the help of Albert staining and extracted by Mussig-Zufika method. Thin layer chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P NMR) were used to characterize properties of these granules. Relation of phosphorus consumption and poly P production with growth was determined by the vanado-molybdate colorimetric method. Among the 60 strains of bacteria isolated from the environmental samples, strain G11 showed ability for the formation of high levels of poly P. Phylogenetic analysis showed that this isolate had 98% similarity with Bacillus megaterium. 16S rRNA sequence of isolate was deposited in GenBank with accession number JX115009.

They were screened for accumulation of PHA by Sudan black B, Nile blue A and Nile red stains. Strains H15, H16 and H26 were selected based on their intensity of Nile blue A/Nile red fluorescence. On the basis of phenotypic and genotypic characterization, the three isolates were identified as Bacillus megaterium. Growth kinetics and polymer accumulating capacity of strain H16 were studied in E2 mineral media with 2% glucose with/without NaCl. In the absence of NaCl, strain H16 accumulated PHA to 40..0% (w/w) of cell dry weight (CDW) at 42 h of growth, whereas in presence of 5% w/v NaCl, the culture showed longer lag phase of up to 24 h and accumulated a maximum PHA of 39% (w/w) CDW at 54 h of growth.

23305929	10.1016/j.bbapap.2012.12.021	Influencing the monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio in tyrosinase.	Tyrosinase is a type 3 copper enzyme with great potential for production of commercially valuable diphenols from monophenols. However, the use of tyrosinase is limited by its further oxidation of diphenols to quinones. We recently determined the structure of the Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase revealing a residue, V218, which we proposed to take part in positioning of substrates within the active site. In the structure of catechol oxidase from Ipomoea batatas, the lack of monophenolase activity was attributed to the presence of F261 near CuA. Consequently, we engineered two variants, V218F and V218G. V218F was expected to have a decreased monophenolase activity, due to the bulky residue extending into the active site. Surprisingly, both V218F and V218G exhibited a 9- and 4.4-fold higher monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio, respectively. X-ray structures of variant V218F display a flexibility of the phenylalanine residue along with an adjacent histidine, which we propose to be the s	2013	5	6	Biochim Biophys Acta	Biochimica et biophysica acta	Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Catechol Oxidase; Copper; Crystallography, X-Ray; Ipomoea batatas; Kinetics; Levodopa; Models, Molecular; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Mutation; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Plant Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Tyrosine; Valine	Goldfeder	Mor

25535706		Biotransformation of arsenic by bacterial strains mediated by oxido-reductase enzyme system.	The present study deals with the enzyme mediated biotransformation of arsenic in five arsenic tolerant strains (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Paenibacillus macerans and Escherichia coli). Biotransformation ability of these isolates was evaluated by monitoring arsenite oxidase and arsenate reductase activity. Results showed that arsenic oxidase activity was exclusively present in P. macerans and B. pumilus while B. subtilis, B. megaterium and E. coli strains showed presence of Arsenic oxido-reductase enzyme. The reversible nature of arsenic oxido- reductase suggested that same enzyme can carry out oxidation and reduction of arsenic depending upon the relative concentration of arsenic species. Lineweaver-Burk plot of the arsenite oxidase activity in P. macerans showed highest Km value (Km- 200 ..M) and lower Vmax (0.012 ..mol mg-1 protein min-1) indicating lowest affinity of the enzyme for arsenite.

Computing chemistry was applied to understand biotransformation mechanism of an organochlorine pesticide, endosulfan. The stereo specific metabolic activity of human CYP-2B6 (cytochrome P450) on endosulfan has been well demonstrated. Sequence and structural similarity search revealed that the bacterium Bacillus megaterium encodes CYP-BM3, which is similar to CYP-2B6. The functional similarity was studied at organism level by batch-scale studies and it was proved that B. megaterium could metabolize endosulfan to endosulfan sulfate, as CYP-2B6 does in human system. The gene expression analyses also confirmed the possible role of CYP-BM3 in endosulfan metabolism. Thus, our results show that the protein structure based in-silico approach can help us to understand and identify microbes for remediation strategy development.

25412177	10.1371/journal.pone.0113663	Bacterial fucose-rich polysaccharide stabilizes MAPK-mediated Nrf2/Keap1 signaling by directly scavenging reactive oxygen species during hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of human lung fibroblast cells.	Continuous free radical assault upsets cellular homeostasis and dysregulates associated signaling pathways to promote stress-induced cell death. In spite of the continuous development and implementation of effective therapeutic strategies, limitations in treatments for stress-induced toxicities remain. The purpose of the present study was to determine the potential therapeutic efficacy of bacterial fucose polysaccharides against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced stress in human lung fibroblast (WI38) cells and to understand the associated molecular mechanisms. In two different fermentation processes, Bacillus megaterium RB-05 biosynthesized two non-identical fucose polysaccharides; of these, the polysaccharide having a high-fucose content (... 42%) conferred the maximum free radical scavenging efficiency in vitro. Structural characterizations of the purified polysaccharides were performed using HPLC, GC-MS, and (1)H/(13)C/2D-COSY NMR.

Immobilization of Bacillus megaterium spores on Eppendorf tubes through physical adsorption has been used in the detection of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk within real time of 45 .. 5 min using visual observation of changes in a chromogenic substrate. The appearance of a sky-blue colour indicates the absence of AFM1 in milk, whereas no colour change indicates the presence of AFM1 in milk at a 0.5 ppb Codex maximum residue limit. The working performance of the immobilized spores was shown to persist for up to 6 months. Further, spores immobilized on 96-well black microtitre plates by physical adsorption and by entrapment on sensor disk showed a reduction in detection sensitivity to 0.25 ppb within a time period of 20 .. 5 min by measuring fluorescence using a microbiological plate reader through the addition of milk and fluorogenic substrate.

25358602	10.1002/mc.22236	Low fucose containing bacterial polysaccharide facilitate mitochondria-dependent ROS-induced apoptosis of human lung epithelial carcinoma via controlled regulation of MAPKs-mediated Nrf2/Keap1 homeostasis signaling.	Reactive oxygen species (ROS), the key mediators of cellular oxidative stress and redox dysregulation involved in cancer initiation and progression, have recently emerged as promising targets for anticancer drug discovery. Continuous free radical assault upsets homeostasis in cellular redox system and regulates the associated signaling pathways to mediate stress-induced cell death. This study investigates the dose-specific pro-oxidative behavior of a bacterial fucose polysaccharide, which attenuated proliferation of different cancer cells. In the fermentation process, Bacillus megaterium RB-05 [GenBank Accession Number HM371417] was found to biosynthesize a polysaccharide with low-fucose content (4.9%), which conferred the maximum anti-proliferative activity (750 ..g/mL) against human lung cancer epithelial cells (A549) during preliminary screening.

This article presents a modeling approach for industrial 2-keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KGA) fed-batch fermentation by the mixed culture of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare (K. vulgare) and Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium). A macrokinetic model of K. vulgare is constructed based on the simplified metabolic pathways. The reaction rates obtained from the macrokinetic model are then coupled into a bioreactor model such that the relationship between substrate feeding rates and the main state variables, e.g., the concentrations of the biomass, substrate and product, is constructed. A differential evolution algorithm using the Lozi map as the random number generator is utilized to perform the model parameters identification, with the industrial data of 2-KGA fed-batch fermentation. Validation results demonstrate that the model simulations of substrate and product concentrations are well in coincidence with the measurements.

In this study, we isolated an endophytic quinclorac-degrading bacterium strain Q3 from the root of tobacco grown in quinclorac contaminated soil. Based on morphological characteristics, Biolog identification, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, we identified strain Q3 as Bacillus megaterium. We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, inoculation size, and initial quinclorac concentration on growth and degrading efficiency of Q3. Under the optimal degrading condition, Q3 could degrade 93% of quinclorac from the initial concentration of 20 mg/L in seven days. We analyzed the degradation products of quinclorac using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The major degradation products by Q3 were different from those of previously identified quinclorac degrading strains, which suggests that Q3 may employ new pathways for quinclorac degradation.

The present study evaluated the potential of Bacillus megaterium as a cyanogenic bacterium to produce cyanide for solubilization of platinum and rhenium from a spent refinery catalyst. Response surface methodology was applied to study the effects and interaction between two main effective parameters including initial glycine concentration and pulp density. Maximum Pt and Re recovery was obtained 15.7% and 98%, respectively, under optimum conditions of 12.8 g/l initial glycine concentration and 4% (w/v) pulp density after 7 days. Increasing the free cyanide concentration to 3.6 mg/l, varying the pH from 6.7 to 9, and increasing the dissolved oxygen from 2 to 5mg/l demonstrated the growth characteristics of B. megaterium during bioleaching process. The modified shrinking core model was used to determine the rate limiting step of the process. It was found that diffusion through the product layer is the rate controlling step.	2015	6	8	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Bacillus megaterium; Kinetics; Process optimization; Pt and Re recovery; Spent refinery catalyst; Bacillus megaterium; Bioreactors; Cell Culture Techniques; Hydrogen Cyanide; Models, Statistical; Petroleum; Platinum; Rhenium; Waste Products	Motaghed	M

A large set of mutants of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium have human cytochrome P450-like activities and the ability to metabolize a number of marketed drugs and steroids. Here, we tested whether the CYP102A1 mutants could be used to produce hydroxylated human metabolites of 17..-estradiol (E2). A set of the mutants, which were generated by site-directed and random mutagenesis, was used to produce hydroxylated human metabolites of E2 in this study. Some of the tested mutants could regioselectively generate 2-OH E2 as a major metabolite but not other hydroxylated products. These results suggest that CYP102A1 mutants would be useful for the bioconversion of steroid hormones to hydroxylated products, which can be used for industrial applications. 	2015	6	22	Biotechnol Lett	Biotechnology letters	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Biotransformation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Estradiol; Hydroxylation; Mutagenesis; Mutant Proteins; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Substrate Specificity	Cha	Gun Su

25008345	10.1124/dmd.114.058636	Regioselective hydroxylation of omeprazole enantiomers by bacterial CYP102A1 mutants.	A large set of Bacillus megaterium CYP102A1 mutants are known to metabolize various drugs to form human metabolites. Omeprazole (OMP), a proton pump inhibitor, has been widely used as an acid inhibitory agent for the treatment of gastric acid hypersecretion disorders. It is primarily metabolized by human CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to 5'-OH OMP and a sulfone product, respectively. It was recently reported that several CYP102A1 mutants can oxidize racemic and S-OMP to 5'-OH OMP and that these mutants can further oxidize 5'-OH racemic OMP to 5'-COOH OMP. Here, we report that the S- and R-enantiomers of OMP are hydroxylated by 26 mutants of CYP102A1 to produce 1 major metabolite (5'-OH OMP) regardless of the chirality of the parent substrates. Although the binding of R-OMP to the CYP102A1 active site caused a more apparent change of heme environment compared with binding of S-OMP, there was no correlation between the spectral change upon substrate binding and catalytic activity of either enantiome	2015	3	30	Drug Metab Dispos	Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Catalysis; Catalytic Domain; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Heme; Hydroxylation; Mutation; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Omeprazole; Oxidation-Reduction; Stereoisomerism	Ryu	Sang Hoon
24988988	10.1007/s12272-014-0366-9	Functional characterization of steroid hydroxylase CYP106A1 derived from Bacillus megaterium.	In this study, we examined the catalytic activity of CYP106A1 from the Bacillus megaterium American Type Culture Collection 14581 strain. The CYP106A1 gene was cloned from B. megaterium, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. Potential electron partners and possible bacterial CYP106A1 substrates were identified by examining the oxidative activity toward a set of steroids in the presence of several reductase systems. The activities of CYP106A1 in a reconstituted system could not be achieved using rat NADPH-P450 reductase or a putidaredoxin reductase-putidaredoxin pair. However, the spinach redox proteins, a ferredoxin reductase-ferredoxin pair, were found to be efficient redox partners for CYP106A1. CYP106A1 catalyzes the hydroxylation of a set of steroids including testosterone, progesterone, 17..-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol to produce monohydroxylated products as the major metabolites.

Production of poly-..-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and the chemical basic compound lactate from the agricultural crop 'wheat straw' as a renewable carbon resource. A thermal pressure hydrolysis procedure for the breakdown of wheat straw was applied. By this means, the wheat straw was converted into a partially solubilized hemicellulosic fraction, consisting of sugar monomers, and an insoluble cellulosic fraction, containing cellulose, lignin and a small portion of hemicellulose. The insoluble cellulosic fraction was further hydrolysed by commercial enzymes in monomers. The production of PHB from the sugar monomers originating from hemicellulose or cellulose was achieved by the isolates Bacillus licheniformis IMW KHC 3 and Bacillus megaterium IMW KNaC 2. The basic chemical compound, lactate, a starting compound for the production of polylactide (PLA), was formed by some heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria (LAB) able to grow with xylose from the hemicellulosic wheat straw hydrolysate.

Biocascades allow one-pot synthesis of chemical building blocks omitting purification of reaction intermediates and expenses for downstream processing. Here we show the first whole cell double oxidation of n-heptane to produce chiral alcohols and heptanones. The concept of an artificial operon for co-expression of a monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium (P450 BM3) and an alcohol dehydrogenase (RE-ADH) from Rhodococcus erythropolis is reported and compared to the widely used two-plasmid or Duet-vector expression systems. Both catalysts are co-expressed on a polycistronic constructs (single mRNA) that reduces recombinant DNA content and metabolic burden for the host cell, therefore increasing growth rate and expression level. Using the artificial operon system, the expression of P450 BM3 reached 81mgg(-1) cell dry weight. In addition, in situ cofactor regeneration through the P450 BM3/RE-ADH couple was enhanced by coupling to glucose oxidation by E. coli.

24903845	10.1186/1475-2859-13-81	Steroid conversion with CYP106A2 - production of pharmaceutically interesting DHEA metabolites.	Steroids are lipophilic compounds with a gonane skeleton and play an important role in higher organisms. Due to different functionalizations - mainly hydroxylations - at the steroid molecule, they vary highly in their mode of action. The pharmaceutical industry is, therefore, interested in hydroxysteroids as therapeutic agents. The insertion of hydroxyl groups into a steroid core, however, is hardly accomplishable by classical chemical means; that is because microbial steroid hydroxylations are investigated and applied since decades. CYP106A2 is a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368, which was first described in the late 1970s and which is capable to hydroxylate a variety of 3-oxo-delta4 steroids at position 15beta. CYP106A2 is a soluble protein, easy to express and to purify in high amounts, which makes this enzyme an interesting target for biotechnological purposes.

24901646	10.1021/ja503593n	Enantioselective imidation of sulfides via enzyme-catalyzed intermolecular nitrogen-atom transfer.	Engineering enzymes with novel reaction modes promises to expand the applications of biocatalysis in chemical synthesis and will enhance our understanding of how enzymes acquire new functions. The insertion of nitrogen-containing functional groups into unactivated C-H bonds is not catalyzed by known enzymes but was recently demonstrated using engineered variants of cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium. Here, we extend this novel P450-catalyzed reaction to include intermolecular insertion of nitrogen into thioethers to form sulfimides. An examination of the reactivity of different P450BM3 variants toward a range of substrates demonstrates that electronic properties of the substrates are important in this novel enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Moreover, amino acid substitutions have a large effect on the rate and stereoselectivity of sulfimidation, demonstrating that the protein plays a key role in determining reactivity and selectivity.

Salusin-.. has been detected in numerous mammalian tissues and has been shown to have various effects on the cardiovascular system. In this study, we showed that salusin-.. exhibited potent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis NBRC 3513, Bacillus megaterium ATCC 19213, Staphylococcus aureus NBRC 12732, and Staphylococcus epidermidis NBRC 12933.

Despite the vast exploration of rhizospheric microbial wealth for crop yield enhancement, knowledge about the efficacy of microbial agents as biocontrol weapons against root-knot disease is scarce, especially in medicinal plants, viz., Bacopa monnieri. In the present investigation, rhizospheric microbes, viz., Bacillus megaterium, Glomus intraradices, Trichoderma harzianum ThU, and their combinations were evaluated for the management of Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chitwood and bacoside content enhancement in B. monnieri var CIM-Jagriti. A novel validated method Fourier transform near infrared was used for rapid estimation of total bacoside content. A significant reduction (2.75-fold) in root-knot indices was observed in the combined treatment of B. megaterium and T. harzianum ThU in comparison to untreated control plants.

High-precision measurements of size changes of individual bacterial spores based on ellipse fitting to bright-field images recorded with a digital camera were employed to monitor the germination of Bacillus spores with a precision of ~5 nm. To characterize the germination of individual spores, we recorded bright-field and phase-contrast images and found that the timing of changes in their normalized intensities coincided, so the bright-field images can be used to characterize spore size and refractility changes during germination. The major conclusions from this work were as follows. (i) The sizes of germinating B. cereus spores were nearly unchanged until Trelease, the time of the completion of CaDPA (a 1:1 chelate of Ca(2+) and dipicolinic acid [DPA]) release after addition of nutrient germinants.

Directed evolution via iterative cycles of random and targeted mutagenesis was applied to the P450 domain of the subterminal fatty acid hydroxylase CYP102A1 of Bacillus megaterium to shift its regioselectivity towards the terminal position of palmitic acid. A powerful and versatile high throughput assay based on LC-MS allowed the simultaneous detection of primary and secondary oxidation products, which was instrumental for identifying variants with a strong preference for the terminal oxidation of palmitic acid. The best variants identified acquired up to 11 amino acid alterations. Substitutions at F87, I263, and A328, relatively close to the bound substrate based on available crystallographic information contributed significantly to the altered regioselectivity. However, non-obvious residues much more distant from the bound substrate showed surprising strong contributions to the increased selectivity for the terminal position of palmitic acid. 	2015	3	30	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Cytochrome P450; Directed evolution; Palmitic acid; Terminal oxidation; Amino Acid Substitution; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Directed Molecular Evolution; Genetic Engineering; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Mutagenesis; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Palmitic Acid	Br..hlmann	Fredi

Cyclic lipopeptides are produced by a soil Bacillus megaterium strain and several other Bacillus species. In this work, they are detected both in the Bacillus intact cells and the cells culture medium by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The cyclic lipopeptides self-assemble in water media producing negatively charged and large aggregates (300-800 nm of mean hydrodynamic radius) as evaluated by dynamic light scattering and zeta-potential analysis. The aggregate size depends on pH and ionic strength. However, it is not affected by changes in the osmolarity of the outer medium suggesting the absence of an internal aqueous compartment despite the occurrence of low molecular weight phospholipids in their composition as determined from inorganic phosphorus analysis.

However, the composition and population dynamics of airborne bacteria have rarely been investigated in downwind areas during Kosa events. In this study, air samplings were sequentially performed at the top of a 10-m high building within the Kosa event arrival area (Kanazawa City, Japan) from May 1 to May 7, 2011, during a Kosa event. The particle concentrations of bacterial cells and mineral particles were ten-fold higher during the Kosa event than on non-Kosa event days. A 16S ribosomal DNA clone library prepared from the air samples primarily contained sequences from three phyla: Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Alphaproteobacteria.

An artificial microbial ecosystem (AME) consisting of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium is currently used in a two-step fermentation process for vitamin C production. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic interactions between the two bacteria, a two-species stoichiometric metabolic model (iWZ-KV-663-BM-1055) consisting of 1718 genes, 1573 metabolites, and 1891 reactions (excluding exchange reactions) was constructed based on separate genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) of K. vulgare and B. megaterium. These two compartments (k and b) of iWZ-KV-663-BM-1055 shared 453 reactions and 548 metabolites. Compartment b was richer in subsystems than compartment k.

Bacillus megaterium is a bacterium that has been used in the past for the industrial production of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), the anti-pernicious anaemia factor. Cobalamin is a modified tetrapyrrole with a cobalt ion coordinated within its macrocycle. More recently, B. megaterium has been developed as a host for the high-yield production of recombinant proteins using a xylose inducible promoter system. Herein, we revisit cobalamin production in B. megaterium DSM319. We have investigated the importance of cobalt for optimum growth and cobalamin production. The cobaltochelatase (CbiX(L)) is encoded within a 14-gene cobalamin biosynthetic (cbi) operon, whose gene-products oversee the transformation of uroporphyrinogen III into adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, a key precursor of cobalamin synthesis. The production of CbiX(L) in response to exogenous cobalt was monitored. The metal was found to stimulate cobalamin biosynthesis and decrease the levels of CbiX(L).

A strain of marine Bacillus megaterium isolated from the Yellow Sea of East China was evaluated for its effect in inhibiting aflatoxin formation in A. flavus through down-regulating aflatoxin pathway gene expression as demonstrated by gene chip analysis. Aflatoxin accumulation in potato dextrose broth liquid medium and liquid minimal medium was almost totally (more than 98..%) inhibited by co-cultivation with B. megaterium. Growth was also reduced. Using expression studies, we identified the fungal genes down-regulated by co-cultivation with B. megaterium across the entire fungal genome and specifically within the aflatoxin pathway gene cluster	2015	8	13	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Aflatoxins; Aspergillus flavus; Bacillus megaterium; Biosynthetic Pathways; China; Culture Media; Down-Regulation; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Indoles; Microbial Interactions; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Seawater	Kong	Qing
24629413	10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2014.02.005	Controlled oxidation of aliphatic CH bonds in metallo-monooxygenases: mechanistic insights derived from studies on deuterated and fluorinated hydrocarbons.	The control over the regio- and/or stereo-selective aliphatic CH oxidation by metalloenzymes is of great interest to scientists. Typically, these enzymes invoke host-guest chemistry to sequester the substrates within the protein pockets, exploiting sizes, shapes and specific interactions such as hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic forces and/or van der Waals interactions to control the substrate specificity, regio-specificity and stereo-selectivity. Over the years, we have developed a series of deuterated and fluorinated variants of these hydrocarbon substrates as probes to gain insights into the controlled CH oxidations of hydrocarbons facilitated by these enzymes. In this review, we illustrate the application of these designed probes in the study of three monooxygenases: (i) the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), which oxidizes straight-chain C1-C5 alkanes and alkenes to form their corresponding 2-alcohols and epoxides, respectively; (ii) the r	2014	11	24	J Inorg Biochem	Journal of inorganic biochemistry	CH activation; Enzyme catalysis; Fluorinated substituents; Isotopomers; Metalloprotein; Monooxygenase; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 CYP4A; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Deuterium; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Kinetics; Methylococcus capsulatus; Models, Molecular; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygenases; Pseudomonas putida; Recombinant Proteins; Substrate Specificity; Thermodynamics	Chen	Yao-Sheng
24598743	10.1107/S139900471303294X	Structural evidence for the partially oxidized dipyrromethene and dipyrromethanone forms of the cofactor of porphobilinogen deaminase: structures of the Bacillus megaterium enzyme at near-atomic resolution.	The enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD; hydroxymethylbilane synthase; EC 2.5.1.61) catalyses an early step of the tetrapyrrole-biosynthesis pathway in which four molecules of the monopyrrole porphobilinogen are condensed to form a linear tetrapyrrole. The enzyme possesses a dipyrromethane cofactor, which is covalently linked by a thioether bridge to an invariant cysteine residue (Cys241 in the Bacillus megaterium enzyme). The cofactor is extended during the reaction by the sequential addition of the four substrate molecules, which are released as a linear tetrapyrrole product. Expression in Escherichia coli of a His-tagged form of B. megaterium PBGD has permitted the X-ray analysis of the enzyme from this species at high resolution, showing that the cofactor becomes progressively oxidized to the dipyrromethene and dipyrromethanone forms. In previously solved PBGD structures, the oxidized cofactor is in the dipyromethenone form, in which both pyrrole rings are approximately coplanar	2014	8	20	Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr	Acta crystallographica.

At least a combination of endoglucanase (EglII) and ..-glucosidase (BglZ) is required for hydrolyzing crystalline cellulose. To understand the catalytic efficiency of combination enzymes for converting biomass to sugars, EglII and BglZ were constructed in the form of individual, fused as well as co-expression proteins, and their activities for hydrolyzing sugarcane bagasse were evaluated.

24588219	10.1042/BJ20140030	Human P450-like oxidation of diverse proton pump inhibitor drugs by 'gatekeeper' mutants of flavocytochrome P450 BM3.	Production of drug metabolites is one area where enzymatic conversion has significant advantages over synthetic chemistry. These high value products are complex to synthesize, but are increasingly important in drug safety testing. The vast majority of drugs are metabolized by cytochromes P450 (P450s), with oxidative transformations usually being highly regio- and stereo-selective. The PPIs (proton pump inhibitors) are drugs that are extensively metabolized by human P450s, producing diverse metabolites dependent on the specific substrate. In the present paper we show that single mutations (A82F and F87V) in the biotechnologically important Bacillus megaterium P450 BM3 enzyme cause major alterations in its substrate selectivity such that a set of PPI molecules become good substrates in these point mutants and in the F87V/A82F double mutant.

Natural colchicinoids and their semisynthetic derivatives are important active ingredients for pharmaceutical applications. Thiocolchicoside (3-demethoxy-3-glucosyloxythiocolchicine) is used in several countries as standard therapy for the treatment of diseases of the muscle-skeletal system, due to its potent antiinflammatory and myorelaxant properties. Manufacturing of thiocolchicoside requires a key step, the regioselective demethylation and glucosylation of chemically derivative thiocolchicine. High selectivity and efficiency of this transformation cannot be achieved in a satisfactory way with a chemical approach. In particular, the chemical demethylation, a part from requiring toxic and aggressive reagents, generates a complex mixture of products with no industrial usefulness.

24503289	10.1017/S1431927613013949	Inactivation and ultrastructure analysis of Bacillus spp. and Clostridium perfringens spores.	Bacterial endospores are resistant to many environmental factors from temperature extremes to ultraviolet irradiation and are generally more difficult to inactivate or kill than vegetative bacterial cells. It is often considered necessary to treat spores or samples containing spores with chemical fixative solutions for prolonged periods of time (e.g., 1-21 days) to achieve fixation/inactivation to enable electron microscopy (EM) examination outside of containment laboratories. Prolonged exposure to chemical fixatives, however, can alter the ultrastructure of spores for EM analyses. This study was undertaken to determine the minimum amount of time required to inactivate/sterilize and fix spore preparations from several bacterial species using a universal fixative solution for EM that maintains the ultrastructural integrity of the spores.

This type of bond disconnection, which has no counterpart in nature, can be mediated by variants of the cytochrome P450 from Bacillus megaterium.

24474032	10.1002/bit.25202	Chimeric cytochromes P450 engineered by domain swapping and random mutagenesis for producing human metabolites of drugs.	Human drug metabolites produced by cytochrome P450 enzymes are critical for safety testing and may themselves act as drugs or leads in the drug discovery and development process. Here, highly active chimeric fusion proteins (chimeras) were obtained by reductase domain swapping of mutants at key catalytic residues of the heme domain with that of a natural variant (CYP102A1.2) of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1.1) from Bacillus megaterium. Random mutagenesis at the heme domain of the chimera was also used to generate chimeric mutants that were more active and diverse than the chimeras themselves. To determine whether the chimeras and several mutants of the highly active chimera displayed enhanced catalytic activity and, more importantly, whether they acquired activities of biotechnological importance, we measured the oxidation activities of the chimeras and chimeric mutants toward human P450 substrates, mainly drugs.

Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis, a frequently occurring disease in northeastern Thailand, where soil and water high in salt content are common. Using microarray analysis, we previously showed that B. pseudomallei up-regulated a short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase (SDO) under salt stress. However, the importance of SDO in B. pseudomallei infection is unknown. This study aimed to explore the function of B. pseudomallei SDO, and to investigate its role in interactions between B. pseudomallei and host cells. Bioinformatics analysis of B. pseudomallei SDO structure, based on homology modeling, revealed a NAD+ cofactor domain and a catalytic triad containing Ser149, Tyr162, and Lys166. This is similar to Bacillus megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase. To investigate the role of this protein, we constructed a B. pseudomallei SDO defective mutant, measured glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) activity, and tested the interactions with host cells.

26642656		SYNTHESIS AND ANTIMICROBIAL EVALUATION OF CYANOPYRIDINYL TETRAHYDRONAPHTHALENE DERIVATIVES.	A novel series of cyanopyridinyl tetrahydronaphthalene incorporated with different heterocycles were synthesized. The key compounds 2a,b were condensed with chloroacetone and ethyl chloroacetate to give 3a,b and 4a,b, respectively. Also condensation of 4a,b with hydrazine hydrate gave the corresponding hydrazide 5a,b. Reaction of 5b with different isothiocyanates gave the corresponding thiosemicarbazide derivatives 6a-c. Also, condensation of 5a with chloroacetic acid, methyl iodide and/or acetic anhydride yielded 7- 9, respectively. Moreover, reaction of 5a with acetylacetone, ethyl acetoacetate, diethylmalonate, ethyl cyanoacetate, chloroacetone, ethyl chloroacetate, urea, phthalic anhydride, malic anhydride and/ or different aldehydes yielded the corresponding derivatives 10-18, respectively.

26638999	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.11.021	Expression of human CYP27A1 in B. megaterium for the efficient hydroxylation of cholesterol, vitamin D3 and 7-dehydrocholesterol.	In the current work the ability of Bacillus megaterium to take up hydrophobic substrates and efficiently express eukaryotic membrane proteins was utilized for establishing a CYP27A1-based biocatalyst. The human mitochondrial cytochrome P450CYP27A1 was co-expressed with its redox partners adrenodoxin reductase (Adr) and adrenodoxin (Adx). CYP27A1 could be localized at the cell's polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules, carbon storage serving organelle-like vesicles that can take up cholesterol, resulting in bioreactor-like structures in B. megaterium . The resulting whole cell system allowed the efficient biotechnological conversion of the CYP27A1 substrates cholesterol, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) and vitamin D3. After 48 h, nearly 100% of cholesterol was metabolized producing a final concentration of 113.14 mg/l 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC). Moreover, 70% of vitamin D3 was converted into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH-D3) with a final concentration of 80.81 mg/l.

Multilayered protein coats are crucial to the dormancy, robustness, and germination of bacterial spores. In Bacillus subtilis spores, the coat contains over 70 distinct proteins. Identifying which proteins reside in each layer may provide insight into their distinct functions. We present image analysis methods that determine the order and geometry of concentric protein layers by fitting a model description for a spheroidal fluorescent shell image to optical micrographs of spores incorporating fluorescent fusion proteins. The radius of a spherical protein shell can be determined with &lt;10..nm error by fitting an equation to widefield fluorescence micrographs. Ellipsoidal shell axes can be fitted with comparable precision. The layer orders inferred for B. subtilis and B. megaterium are consistent with measurements in the literature.

Piscidins were the first antimicrobial peptides discovered in the mast cells of vertebrates. While two family members, piscidin 1 (p1) and piscidin 3 (p3), have highly similar sequences and ..-helical structures when bound to model membranes, p1 generally exhibits stronger antimicrobial and hemolytic activity than p3 for reasons that remain elusive. In this study, we combine activity assays and biophysical methods to investigate the mechanisms underlying the cellular function and differing biological potencies of these peptides, and report findings spanning three major facets. First, added to Gram-positive (Bacillus megaterium) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria at sublethal concentrations and imaged by confocal microscopy, both p1 and p3 translocate across cell membranes and colocalize with nucleoids. In E. coli, translocation is accompanied by nonlethal permeabilization that features more pronounced leakage for p1.

In this study boron removal capacities of different microorganisms were tested. Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus versicolor were examined for their boron bioaccumulation capacities in simulated municipal wastewater. A. versicolor and B. cereus were found as the most boron-tolerant microorganisms in the experiments. Also boron bioaccumulation yield of A. versicolor was 49.25% at 15 mg/L boron concentration. On the other hand biosorption experiments revealed that A. versicolor was more capable of boron removal in inactive form at the highest boron concentrations. In this paper maximum boron bioaccumulation yield was detected as 39.08% at 24.17 mg/L and the maximum boron biosorption yield was detected as 41.36% at 24.01 mg/L boron concentrations. 	2016	4	25	Water Sci Technol	Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	Aspergillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacteria; Boron; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water	La..in	Beng..
26525435	10.1038/srep16128	Bio-grout based on microbially induced sand solidification by means of asparaginase activity.	Bio-grout, a new ground improvement method, has been recently developed to improve the mechanical properties, decrease the permeability of porous materials, reinforce or repair cementitious materials and modify the properties of soil or sand. Bio-grout production depends on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP), which is driven mainly by an enzyme, urease. However, urease-based MICP process produces excessive ammonia, in addition to secondary pollution generated by urea that is used as substrate in it. In the present study, we reported asparaginase-based MICP process for sand bio-grout development using Bacillus megaterium, and results were also compared with urease-based bio-grouts. The asparaginase activity led to significantly less ammonia production compared to urease without compromising with desired properties of a novel grout. The UCS of bio-grout was obtained at 980...kPa, while the permeability was decreased substantially.

26511952	10.1093/femsle/fnv210	Structure-function analysis of the Bacillus megaterium GerUD spore germinant receptor protein.	Germination of Bacillus spores is triggered by the interaction of germinant molecules with specialized receptor proteins localized to the spore inner membrane. Germinant receptors (GRs) are comprised typically of three interacting protein subunits, each of which is essential for receptor function. At least some GRs appear to have a fourth component, referred to as a D-subunit protein. A number of D-subunit proteins were shown previously to be capable of modulating the activity of associated GRs. Here, we investigate the topology and structure-function relationships of the Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 GerUD protein, which is associated with the GerU GR. The presented data demonstrate that GerUD can be subjected to relatively extensive structural modifications while retaining function. Indeed, the presence of either of the two transmembrane spanning domains is sufficient to modulate an efficient GerU-mediated germinative response.

26461518	10.1002/bit.25855	Using tyrosinase as a monophenol monooxygenase: A combined strategy for effective inhibition of melanin formation.	Tyrosinase is a binuclear copper-containing metalloprotein that leads the fast and regio-selective o-hydroxylation of monophenols to o-diphenols. However, the subsequent second oxidation to produce o-quinones, i.e., melanin precursors, from the o-diphenols has restricted its use to the production of functional o-diphenol derivatives. Herein, we present a combined strategy for the effective inhibition of melanin formation in tyrosinase reaction, which allows the use of tyrosinase as a monophenol monooxygenase. The o-diphenolic products were protected from being oxidized in the tyrosinase reaction by borate ions and L-ascorbic acid (LAA). Borate-o-diphenol complexes were favorable formed at high pH and consequentially protected the o-diphenolic products from the catecholase activity of tyrosinase. LAA not only directly reduced the byproduct, o-quinones, into o-diphenols but also assisted the completion of the tyrosinase reaction cycle by removing a hydroxyl group attached to the copper m	2016	11	9	Biotechnol Bioeng	Biotechnology and bioengineering	7,3...,4...-trihydroxyisoflavone; Bacillus megaterium; isoflavone; monooxygenase; ortho-hydroxylation; tyrosinase; Ascorbic Acid; Bacillus megaterium; Borates; Escherichia coli; Isoflavones; Melanins; Monophenol Monooxygenase	Lee	Sang-Hyuk

Bacterial species were identified using 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing techniques and the results indicate the prevalence of Bacillus sp. Resistance patterns to mercurial compounds were established by the determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations. Representative Hg-resistant bacteria were further tested for transformation pathways (reduction, volatilization and methylation) in cultures containing mercury chloride.

Cytochrome P450s are interesting biocatalysts due to their ability to hydroxylate non-activated hydrocarbons in a selective manner. However, to date only a few P450-catalyzed processes have been implemented in industry due to the difficulty of developing economically feasible processes. In this study, we have used the CYP153A heme domain from Marinobacter aquaeolei fused to the reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BM3) expressed in Escherichia coli. This self-sufficient protein chimera CYP153A-CPRBM3 G307A mutant is able to selectively hydroxylate medium and long chain length fatty acids at the terminal position. ..-Hydroxylated fatty acids can be used in the field of high-end polymers and in the cosmetic and fragrance industry.

The potential for biological treatment of an environment contaminated by complex petrochemical contaminants was evaluated using creosote contaminated soil in ex situ bio-slurry reactors. The efficacy of biosurfactant application and stimulation of in situ biosurfactant production was investigated. The biosurfactant produced was purified and characterised using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Biosurfactant enhanced degradation of PAHs was 86.5% (with addition of biosurfactant) and 57% in controls with no biosurfactant and nutrient amendments after incubation for 45 days. A slight decrease in degradation rate observed in the simultaneous biosurfactant and nutrient, NH4NO3 and KH2PO4, supplemented microcosm can be attributed to preferential microbial consumption of the biosurfactant supplemented.

We demonstrate here that genes encoded on the indigenous pBM500 and pBM600 plasmids are required for exosporium assembly and or stability in spores of this strain. Bioinformatic analyses identified genes encoding orthologues of the B. cereus-family exosporium nap and basal layer proteins within the B. megaterium genome. Transcriptional analyses, supported by electron and fluorescent microscopy, indicate that the pole-localized nap, identified here for the first time in B. megaterium QM B1551 spores, is comprised of the BclA1 protein. The role of the BxpB protein, which forms the basal layer of the exosporium in B. cereus spores, is less clear since spores of a null mutant strain display an apparently normal morphology.

In this study, a hydroponic culture experiment was conducted in a greenhouse to investigate the molecular and microbial mechanisms involved in the endophytic Bacillus megaterium 1Y31-enhanced Mn tolerance and accumulation in Mn hyperaccumulator hybrid pennisetum. Strain 1Y31 significantly increased the dry weights (ranging from 28% to 94%) and total Mn uptake (ranging from 23% to 112%) of hybrid pennisetum treated with 0, 2, and 10mM Mn compared to the control. Total 98 leaf differentially expressed proteins were identified between the live and dead bacterial inoculated hybrid pennisetum.

For the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals, chiral alcohols are useful intermediates. Among them, (R)-ethyl-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((R)-ECHB) is an important building block for the synthesis of L-carnitine. (R)-ECHB is produced from ethyl-4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (ECOB) by a reductase-mediated, enantioselective reduction reaction. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae YOL151W reductase that is expressed in Escherichia coli cells exhibited an enantioselective reduction reaction toward ECOB. By virtue of the C-terminal His-tag, the YOL151W reductase was purified from the cell-free extract using Ni(2+)-NTA column chromatography and immobilized onto Ni(2+)-magnetic microparticles. The physical properties of the immobilized reductase (Imm-Red) were measured using electron microscopy, a magnetic property measurement system, and a zeta potential system; the average size of the particles was approximately 1 ..m and the saturated magnetic value was 31.76 emu/g.

Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles has provoked nowadays and alternative to physical and chemical approaches. In the present study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized extracellular method using Bacillus megaterium. The AgNPs formations were confirmed initially through color change, and the aliquots were characterized through UV-visible spectrophotometer, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The surface plasmon resonance band was shown at 430..nm in UV-vis spectrophotometer. The bioreduction was categorized through identifying the compounds responsible for the AgNP synthesis, and the functional group present in B. megaterium cell-free culture was scrutinized using FTIR.

Inoculation of leguminous seeds with bioinoculants has been practiced in agriculture for decades to ameliorate grain yield by enhanced growth parameters and soil fertility. However, effective enhancement of plant growth parameters results not only from the direct effects these bioinoculants impose on them but also from their non-target effects. The ability of bioinoculants to reduce the application of chemicals for obtaining optimum yield of legume appears to be of great ecological and economic importance. In the present study, we compared the influence of seed inoculation of Cajanus cajan with a microbial consortium, comprising Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Trichoderma harzianum, with that of application of chemical fertilizers on plant's growth parameters and its rhizospheric microbial communities. Real-time PCR assay was carried out to target the structure (16S rRNA) and function (nitrogen cycle) of rhizospheric microbiota, using both DNA and RNA as markers.

Bacteria serve as live food and nutrients for bacterial-feeding nematodes (BFNs) in soils, and influence nematodes behavior and physiology through their metabolism. Five bacterial taxa (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens JX1, Variovorax sp. JX14, Bacillus megaterium JX15, Pseudomonas fluorescens Y1 and Escherichia coli OP50) and the typical BFN Caenorhabditis elegans were selected to study the effects of bacterial respiration and growth rates on the feeding preferences, brood size and lifespan of nematodes. P. fluorescens Y1 and E. coli OP50 were found to be more active, with high respiration and rapid growth, whereas B. amyloliquefaciens JX1 and B. megaterium JX15 were inactive. The nematode C. elegans preferred active P. fluorescens Y1 and E. coli OP50 obviously. Furthermore, worms that fed on these two active bacteria produced more offspring but had shorter lifespan, while inactive and less preferred bacteria had increased nematodes lifespan and decreased the brood size.

The full-length protein is essential in stabilising the SleB cortex lytic enzyme in Bacillus spores, and may have a role in regulating SleB activity during spore germination. The YpeB-C crystal structure comprises three tandemly repeated PepSY domains, which are aligned to form an extended laterally compressed molecule.

Cholesterol, the precursor of all steroid hormones, is the most abundant steroid in vertebrates and exhibits highly hydrophobic properties, rendering it a difficult substrate for aqueous microbial biotransformations. In the present study, we developed a Bacillus megaterium based whole-cell system that allows the side-chain cleavage of this sterol and investigated the underlying physiological basis of the biocatalysis. CYP11A1, the side-chain cleaving cytochrome P450, was recombinantly expressed in the Gram-positive soil bacterium B. megaterium combined with the required electron transfer proteins. By applying a mixture of 2-hydroxypropyl-..-cyclodextrin and Quillaja saponin as solubilizing agents, the zoosterols cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol, as well as the phytosterol ..-sitosterol could be efficiently converted to pregnenolone or 7-dehydropregnenolone.

After nuclear accidents, such as those experienced in Chernobyl and Fukushima, microorganisms may help purify contaminated soils by changing the mobility of radionuclides and their availability for plants by altering the physical and chemical properties of the substrate. Here, using model experiments with quartz sand as a substrate we investigate the influence of microorganisms on (137)Cs transfer from substrate to plants. The highest transition of (137)Cs from substrate to plants (50% increase compared to the control) was observed after Brassica napus L. seeds were inoculated by Azotobacter chroococcum. The best results for reducing the accumulation of (137)Cs radionuclides (30% less) were noted after the inoculation by Burkholderia sp..

We have used the machinery from the peptide-based agr QS system from Staphylococcus aureus to engineer a synthetic QS system in Bacillus megaterium to enable autoinduction of a target gene at high cell densities. Growth and gene expression from these synthetic QS cells were characterized in both complex and minimal media.

26190134	10.1002/prot.24861	Structural and functional analysis of SleL, a peptidoglycan lysin involved in germination of Bacillus spores.	A major event in the germination of Bacillus spores concerns hydrolysis of the cortical peptidoglycan that surrounds the spore protoplast, the integrity of which is essential for maintenance of dormancy. Cortex degradation is initiated in all species of Bacillus spores by the combined activity of two semi-redundant cortex-lytic enzymes, SleB and CwlJ. A third enzyme, SleL, which has N-acetylglucosaminidase activity, cleaves peptidoglycan fragments generated by SleB and CwlJ. Here we present crystal structures of B. cereus and B. megaterium SleL at 1.6 angstroms and 1.7 angstroms, respectively. The structures were determined with a view to identifying the structural basis of differences in catalytic efficiency between the respective enzymes.

Novel examples for 11-oxidation were identified and confirmed by (1)H and (13)C NMR for prednisolone, dexamethasone and 11..-hydroxyandrostenedione. However, only 11..-hydroxyandrostenedione formed a single 11-keto product. The latter reaction was chosen to investigate the kinetic solvent isotope effect on the steady-state turnover of the CYP106A1-mediated 11-oxidation.

26150423	10.1093/nar/gkv681	Structural basis of the mercury(II)-mediated conformational switching of the dual-function transcriptional regulator MerR.	The mer operon confers bacterial resistance to inorganic mercury (Hg(2+)) and organomercurials by encoding proteins involved in sensing, transport and detoxification of these cytotoxic agents. Expression of the mer operon is under tight control by the dual-function transcriptional regulator MerR. The metal-free, apo MerR binds to the mer operator/promoter region as a repressor to block transcription initiation, but is converted into an activator upon Hg(2+)-binding. To understand how MerR interacts with Hg(2+) and how Hg(2+)-binding modulates MerR function, we report here the crystal structures of apo and Hg(2+)-bound MerR from Bacillus megaterium, corresponding respectively to the repressor and activator conformation of MerR. To our knowledge, the apo-MerR structure represents the first visualization of a MerR family member in its intact and inducer-free form.

26138251	10.1007/s00253-015-6744-5	Impact of rare codons and the functional coproduction of rate-limiting tRNAs on recombinant protein production in Bacillus megaterium.	The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium was systematically developed for the plasmid-based production of recombinant proteins at the gram-per-liter scale. The amount of protein produced per cell was found strongly correlated to the codon usage of the heterologous gene of interest in comparison to the codon usage of B. megaterium. For analyzing the influence of rare codons on the translational efficiency and protein production in B. megaterium, a test system using the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter was established. For this purpose, four consecutive identical codons were introduced into the 5' end of gfp and the resulting variations in GFP formation were quantified. Introduction of the rare codons GCC, CGG, and ACC for alanine, arginine, and threonine reduced GFP production 2.1-, 3.3-, and 1.7-fold in comparison to the favored codons GCU, CGU, and ACA, respectively.

26135986	10.1007/s00253-015-6777-9	Class IV polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases and PHA-producing Bacillus.	This review highlights the recent investigations of class IV polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthases, the newest classification of PHA synthases. Class IV synthases are prevalent in organisms of the Bacillus genus and are composed of a catalytic subunit PhaC (approximately 40..kDa), which has a PhaC box sequence ([GS]-X-C-X-[GA]-G) at the active site, and a second subunit PhaR (approximately 20..kDa). The representative PHA-producing Bacillus strains are Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus cereus; the nucleotide sequence of phaC and the genetic organization of the PHA biosynthesis gene locus are somewhat different between these two strains. It is generally considered that class IV synthases favor short-chain-length monomers such as 3-hydroxybutyrate (C4) and 3-hydroxyvalerate (C5) for polymerization, but can polymerize some unusual monomers as minor components.

26116677	10.1128/AEM.00807-15	Polar Fixation of Plasmids during Recombinant Protein Production in Bacillus megaterium Results in Population Heterogeneity.	During the past 2 decades, Bacillus megaterium has been systematically developed for the gram-per-liter scale production of recombinant proteins. The plasmid-based expression systems employed use a xylose-controlled promoter. Protein production analyses at the single-cell level using green fluorescent protein as a model product revealed cell culture heterogeneity characterized by a significant proportion of less productive bacteria. Due to the enormous size of B. megaterium, such bistable behavior seen in subpopulations was readily analyzed by time lapse microscopy and flow cytometry. Cell culture heterogeneity was not caused simply by plasmid loss: instead, an asymmetric distribution of plasmids during cell division was detected during the exponential-growth phase. Multicopy plasmids are generally randomly distributed between daughter cells. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that under conditions of strong protein production, plasmids are retained at one of the ce	2016	2	8	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacillus megaterium; Cell Polarity; Genetic Vectors; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Plasmids; Recombinant Proteins	M..nch	Karin M

In addition, the effect of lectin on membrane integrity of most sensitive species was also evaluated. All the tested bacteria are able to cause biocorrosion and some are also responsible for human infections. WSMoL inhibited the bacterial growth, induced agglutination and promoted the leakage of proteins from cells of all strains. Bactericidal effect was detected against Bacillus sp., B. pumillus, B. megaterium, Ps. fluorescens and Ser. marcescens. The bacteriostatic effect of lectin was evident with only 6 h of incubation.

As a pivotal member of cytochrome P450 superfamily, it has been intensely studied for the comprehension of structure-dynamics-function relationships in this class of enzymes. In addition, due to its peculiar properties, it is also a promising enzyme for biochemical and biomedical applications. However, despite the efforts, the full understanding of the enzyme structure and dynamics is not yet achieved. Computational studies, particularly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have importantly contributed to this endeavor by providing new insights at an atomic level regarding the correlations between structure, dynamics, and function of the protein.

Nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton density and community composition, and the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state of heterotrophic bacteria were investigated in three connected reservoirs and a small isolated lake in South China to study the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors and the VBNC state in bacteria. Nutrient concentrations in the reservoirs increased in the direction of water flow, whereas Wenshan Lake was more eutrophic. Cyanobacterial blooms occurred in all four water bodies, with differing seasonal trends and dominant species. In Xili and Tiegang Reservoirs, the VBNC ratio (percent of VBNC state bacteria over total viable bacteria) was high for most of the year and negatively correlated with cyanobacterial density.

Clostridium difficile is the major cause of hospital-acquired infectious diarrhea and colitis in developed countries. The pathogenicity of C. difficile is mainly mediated by the release of 2 large potent exotoxins, toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB), both of which require neutralization to prevent disease occurrence. We have generated a novel chimeric protein, designated mTcd138, comprised of the glucosyltransferase and cysteine proteinase domains of TcdB and the receptor binding domain of TcdA and expressed it in Bacillus megaterium. To ensure that mTcd138 is atoxic, 2 point mutations were introduced to the glucosyltransferase domain of TcdB, which essentially eliminates toxicity of mTcd138. Parenteral immunizations of mice and hamsters with mTcd138 induced protective antibodies to both toxins and provided protection against infection with the hyper-virulent C. difficile strain UK6. 	2016	5	16	Hum Vaccin Immunother	Human vaccines &amp; immunotherapeutics	Clostridium difficile infection; chimeric protein; vaccine; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Toxins; Bacterial Vaccines; Clostridioides difficile; Clostridium Infections; Cysteine Proteases; Disease Models, Animal; Enterotoxins; Female; Gene Expression; Glucosyltransferases; Mesocricetus; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mutant Proteins; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Treatment Outcome; Vaccines, Synthetic	Wang	Yuan-Kai

To acquire a thermostable xylanase, that is suitable for xylooligosaccharide production from pretreated corncobs, the metagenomic method was used to obtain the gene from an uncultured environmental microorganism. A thermostable xylanase-encoding gene (xyn10CD18) was cloned directly from the metagenomic DNA of cow dung compost. When xyn10CD18 was expressed in Bacillus megaterium MS941, extracellular xylansae activity at 106 IU/ml was achieved. The purified recombinant Xyn10CD18 was optimally active at pH 7 and 75 ..C as measured over 10 min. It retained over 55% of its initial activity at 70 ..C and pH 7 after 24 h.

Biodegradable polymers are currently viable alternatives to traditional synthetic polymers. For instance, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is intracellularly produced and accumulated by Bacillus species, among others. This study reports several wild-type Bacillus strains with the ability to accumulate PHB using raw glycerol from biodiesel production as the sole carbon source. Out of 15 strains from different sources, B. megaterium B2 was selected as the most promising strain for further statistical optimization of the medium composition. Plackett-Burman and central composite designs were used to establish key variables and optimal culture conditions for PHB production using both 250-mL shake flasks and a 7.5-L bioreactor. Temperature and concentrations of glycerol and Na2HPO4 are the experimental variables with the most significant influence on PHB production by B2. After 14 hours of fermentation in shake flasks with optimized medium, B2 produced 0.43 g/L of PHB with a 34% accumulation in the	2016	6	6	N Biotechnol	New biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Glycerol; Hydroxybutyrates; Industrial Waste; Nutritive Value; Phosphates; Polyesters; Temperature	Moreno	Paalo

Shikimic acid, the sole chemical building block for the antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu..), is one of the potent pharmaceutical intermediates with three chiral centers. Here we report a metabolically engineered recombinant Bacillus megaterium strain with aroE (shikimate dehydrogenase) overexpression for the production of shikimic acid. In a 7 L bioreactor, 4.2 g/L shikimic acid was obtained using the recombinant strain over 0.53 g/L with the wild type. The enhancement of total shikimate dehydrogenase activity was 2.13-fold higher than the wild type. Maximum yield of shikimic acid (12.54 g/L) was obtained with fructose as carbon source. It was isolated from the fermentation broth using amberlite IRA-400 resin and 89% purity of the product was achieved. This will add up a new organism in the armory for the fermentation based production which is better over plant based extraction and chemical synthesis of shikimic acid.	2016	3	17	Microb Cell Fact	Microbial cell factories	Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Fermentation; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Shikimic Acid	Ghosh	Saptarshi

The impact of certain types of microorganisms on 137Cs transfer from the substrate into the plant was analyzed in the experiment on artificial mediums. It was found that certain types of microorganisms could either reduce or increase the ratio of 137Cs transfer from the substrate to the plant. It is shown that this property is independent of the localization of the microorganism on the surface of the root, for all the analyzed bacteria belonging to the rhizospheric group. Azotobacter chroococcum UKM B-6003 stimulated the radionuclide transfer to plants up to 1.5 times, while the best bacteria for reducing its accumulation is Burkholderia sp IMER-B1 -53 - 1.3 times in comparison with the control. It was shown that the strain Bacillus megaterium UKM B-5724 from the collection of the Institute of Microbiology and Virology of NASU has a high ability to accumulate radionuclides.	2015	6	12	Radiats Biol Radioecol	Radiatsionnaia biologiia, radioecologiia	Azotobacter; Burkholderia; Cesium Radioisotopes; Chernobyl Nuclear Accident; Plants; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive	Pareniuk	O Yu

In Uruguay, Fusarium graminearum is the most common species that infects wheat and is responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB) and contamination of grain with deoxynivalenol (DON). The aim of this work was to select bacterial endophytes isolated from wheat grain to evaluate their antagonistic ability against F. graminearum and DON production in vitro and under field conditions. Four strains identified as Bacillus megaterium (BM1) and Bacillus subtilis (BS43, BSM0 y BSM2) significantly reduced fungal growth and spore germination of F. graminearum. This antagonist activity remained unchanged after the bacterial cultures were heat treated. Under field conditions, treatments with antagonist BM1 was the most effective, reducing the FHB incidence and severity by 93 and 54 %, respectively, and the production of DON by 89.3 %.	2016	4	25	Mycotoxin Res	Mycotoxin research	Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Fusarium; Mycelium; Plant Diseases; Spores, Fungal; Trichothecenes; Triticum; Uruguay; Whole Grains	Pan	D

The objective of this research work is to isolate and identify calcite precipitating bacteria and to check the suitability of these bacteria for use in concrete to improve its strength. Bacteria to be incorporated in concrete should be alkali resistant to endure the high pH of concrete and endospore forming to withstand the mechanical stresses induced in concrete during mixing. They must exhibit high urease activity to precipitate calcium carbonate in the form of calcite. Bacterial strains were isolated from alkaline soil samples of a cement factory and were tested for urease activity, potential to form endospores and precipitation of calcium carbonate. Based on these results, three isolates were selected and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. They were identified as Bacillus megaterium BSKAU, Bacillus licheniformis BSKNAU and Bacillus flexus BSKNAU.

The LitR/CarH family of proteins is a light-sensitive MerR family of transcriptional regulators that contain an adenosyl B12 (coenzyme B12 or AdoB12)-binding domain at the C terminus. The genes encoding these proteins are found in phylogenetically diverse bacterial genera; however, the biochemical properties of these proteins from Gram-positive bacteria remain poorly understood. We performed genetic and biochemical analyses of a homolog of the LitR protein from Bacillus megaterium QM B1551, a Gram-positive endospore-forming soil bacterium. Carotenoid production was induced by illumination in this bacterium. In vivo analysis demonstrated that LitR plays a central role in light-inducible carotenoid production and serves as a negative regulator of the light-inducible transcription of crt and litR itself. Biochemical evidence showed that LitR in complex with AdoB12 binds to the promoter regions of litR and the crt operon in a light-sensitive manner.

The CYP106A subfamily hydroxylates steroids, diterpenes, and triterpenes in a regioselective and stereoselective manner, which is a challenging task for synthetic chemistry. The well-studied CYP106A2 enzyme, from the Bacillus megaterium strain ATCC 13368, is a highly promising candidate for the pharmaceutical industry. It shares 63 % amino acid sequence identity with CYP106A1 from B. megaterium DSM319, which was recently characterized. A focused steroid library was screened with both CYP106A1 and CYP106A2. Out of the 23 tested steroids, 19 were successfully converted by both enzymes during in vitro and in vivo reactions. Thirteen new substrates were identified for CYP106A1, while the substrate spectrum of CYP106A2 was extended by seven new members. Finally, six chosen steroids were further studied on a preparative scale employing a recombinant B. megaterium MS941 whole-cell system, yielding sufficient amounts of product for structure characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance.

Haihua 1) after various durations of time were investigated in natural soils. The addition of bacteria and nematodes and incubation time all significantly affected plant growth, plant root growth, plant nutrient concentrations, soil nutrient concentrations, soil microorganisms and soil auxin concentration. The addition of nematodes caused greater increases in these indices than those of bacteria, while the addition of the combination of bacteria and nematodes caused further increases. After 42-day growth, the increases in soil respiration differed between the additions of two kinds of nematodes because of differences in their life strategies. The effects of the bacteria and nematodes on the nutrient and hormone concentrations were responsible for the increases in plant growth.	2016	3	26	PLoS One	PloS one	Animals; Arachis; Bacillus megaterium; Biomass; Indoleacetic Acids; Nematoda; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil	Xu	Li
25790435	10.1371/journal.pone.0119125	The GerW protein is not involved in the germination of spores of Bacillus species.	Germination of dormant spores of Bacillus species is initiated when nutrient germinants bind to germinant receptors in spores' inner membrane and this interaction triggers the release of dipicolinic acid and cations from the spore core and their replacement by water. Bacillus subtilis spores contain three functional germinant receptors encoded by the gerA, gerB, and gerK operons. The GerA germinant receptor alone triggers germination with L-valine or L-alanine, and the GerB and GerK germinant receptors together trigger germination with a mixture of L-asparagine, D-glucose, D-fructose and KCl (AGFK). Recently, it was reported that the B. subtilis gerW gene is expressed only during sporulation in developing spores, and that GerW is essential for L-alanine germination of B. subtilis spores but not for germination with AGFK. However, we now find that loss of the B. subtilis gerW gene had no significant effects on: i) rates of spore germination with L-alanine; ii) spores' levels of germinat	2015	12	7	PLoS One	PloS one	Alanine; Asparagine; Bacillus; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Genotype; Glucose; Spores, Bacterial; Temperature; Valine; beta-Galactosidase	Cruz-Mora	Jose

Analysis of the genome of Bacillus halodurans strain C125 indicated that two pathways leading from a cytosine deoxyribonucleotide to dUMP, used for dTMP synthesis, were encoded by the genome of the bacterium. The genes that were responsible, the comEB gene and the dcdB gene, encoding dCMP deaminase and the bifunctional dCTP deaminase:dUTPase (DCD:DUT), respectively, were both shown to be expressed in B. halodurans, and both genes were subject to repression by the nucleosides thymidine and deoxycytidine. The latter nucleoside presumably exerts its repression after deamination by cytidine deaminase. Both comEB and dcdB were cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to homogeneity. Both enzymes were active and displayed the expected regulatory properties: activation by dCTP for dCMP deaminase and dTTP inhibition for both enzymes.

Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages and has been growing steadily in commercial importance. Nowadays, coffee is the second largest traded commodity in the world, after petroleum. Hence, coffee industry is responsible for the generation of large amounts of waste, especially spent coffee grounds (SCG). Various attempts to valorize this waste stream of coffee industry were made. This article summarizes our research and publications aiming at the conversion of SCG into valuable products - polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and carotenoids. At first, oil extracted from SCG (approx. 15 wt% oil in SCG) can be efficiently (YP/S=0.82 g/g) converted into PHA employing Cupriavidus necator H16. Further, the solid residues after oil extraction can be hydrolyzed (by the combination of chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis) yielding fermentable sugars, which can be further used as a substrate for the production of PHAs employing Bacillus megaterium (YP/S=0.04 g/g) or Burkholderia cepacia (YP/S=	2016	6	6	N Biotechnol	New biotechnology	Biofuels; Biotechnology; Carotenoids; Coffee; Conservation of Natural Resources; Liquid-Liquid Extraction; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Refuse Disposal	Obruca	Stanislav

Analysis of 16S rRNA genes from scCO2 enrichment cultures revealed microbial assemblages of varied complexity, including representatives of the genus Bacillus. Propagation of enrichment cultures under scCO2 headspace led to isolation of six strains corresponding to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subterraneus, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus safensis, and Bacillus megaterium.

Toxicity of pesticides towards microorganisms can have a major impact on ecosystem function. Nevertheless, some microorganisms are able to respond quickly to this stress by degrading these molecules. The edaphic Bacillus megaterium strain Mes11 can degrade the herbicide mesotrione. In order to gain insight into the cellular response involved, the intracellular proteome of Mes11 exposed to mesotrione was analyzed using the two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) approach coupled with mass spectrometry. The results showed an average of 1820 protein spots being detected. The gel profile analyses revealed 32 protein spots whose abundance is modified after treatment with mesotrione. Twenty spots could be identified, leading to 17 non redundant proteins, mainly involved in stress, metabolic and storage mechanisms. These findings clarify the pathways used by B. megaterium strain Mes11 to resist and adapt to the presence of mesotrione. 	2015	9	4	Environ Pollut	Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)	2D-DIGE; Differential proteomic; Pesticides; Physiological responses; Soil bacteria; Adaptation, Physiological; Bacillus megaterium; Cyclohexanones; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Herbicides; Proteome	Bardot	Corinne

27192817		[A METHOD FOR DIFFERENTIATION OF BACILLUS ANTHRACIS STRAINS AND PHYLOGENETICALLY RELATED SPECIES BASED ON DETERMINATION OF THE STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCESBETWEEN CHROMOSOMAL GENES FOR BIOSYNTHESIS OF FLAGELLIN AND METHIONINE].	Nucleotide sequence analysis of several genes responsible for the anthrax pathogen definitive properties--motility and penicillinase activity--determined a chromosomal locus promising for interspecies differentiation. We demonstrated that the gene fliC encoding flagellin synthesis contains extended region, distinguishing B. anthracis strains from the majority of non-pathogenic and opportunistic bacilli. A novel method for the anthrax pathogen indication and identification based on determination of the differences in the chromosomal genes fliC and hom2 structure was suggested. A total of 60 strains of different Bacillus spp. (B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, B. mycoides, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, etc.) were tested using two chromosomal DNA targets.

24840788	10.1080/10826068.2014.923454	A simple one pot purification of bacterial amylase from fermented broth based on affinity toward starch-functionalized magnetic nanoparticle.	Surface-functionalized adsorbant particles in combination with magnetic separation techniques have received considerable attention in recent years. Selective manipulation on such magnetic nanoparticles permits separation with high affinity in the presence of other suspended solids. Amylase is used extensively in food and allied industries. Purification of amylase from bacterial sources is a matter of concern because most of the industrial need for amylase is met by microbial sources. Here we report a simple, cost-effective, one-pot purification technique for bacterial amylase directly from fermented broth of Bacillus megaterium utilizing starch-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION). SPION was prepared by co-precipitation method and then functionalized by starch coating.

Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are organic metabolic compounds excreted by microorganisms. They largely impact microbial aggregate structures and functions. Extracellular polysaccharides (EP) in EPS are responsible for the formation of microbial aggregates. In this work, we successfully separated and characterized EP from EPS of the bacterium Bacillus megaterium TF10. Extraction of EP from EPS was optimized using Sevag's reagent. Chemical characteristics, functional groups, and molecular weight (MW) distribution of EP were compared with the harvested EPS and soluble microbial products (SMP). We found that the polymers of lower MW and free proteins were successfully removed by Sevag's reagent. The higher MW components of EPS were predominantly polysaccharides, while the polymers of lower MW tended to secrete to the supernatant and were described as SMP.

In this study the ability of CYP109E1 from Bacillus megaterium to metabolize vitamin D3 (VD3) was investigated. In an in vitro system using bovine adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) and adrenodoxin (Adx4-108), VD3 was converted by CYP109E1 into several products. Furthermore, a whole-cell system in B. megaterium MS941 was established. The new system showed a conversion of 95% after 24h. By NMR analysis it was found that CYP109E1 catalyzes hydroxylation of VD3 at carbons C-24 and C-25, resulting in the formation of 24(S)-hydroxyvitamin D3 (24S(OH)VD3), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)VD3) and 24S,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24S,25(OH)2VD3).

The presence of fungicides in the natural environment, either resulting from deliberate actions or not, has become a serious threat to many ecosystems, including soil. This can be prevented by taking appropriate measures to clear the environment of organic contamination, including fungicides. Therefore, a study was conducted aimed at determining the effect of bioaugmentation of soil exposed to azoxystrobin on its degradation and activity of selected enzymes (dehydrogenases, catalase, urease, acidic phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase).

Enzymatic conversion of natural glycosides to their corresponding hydroxylated products using cytochromes P450 has significant advantages over synthetic chemistry and even enzyme-catalyzed glycosylation of chemicals. At present, the basic strategy for making glycosides of stilbenoid compounds is to use the glycosylation activity of enzymes, such as glycosyltransferases. Here, an efficient synthesis of a valuable (E)-astringin, a piceatannol glucoside, was developed using CYP102A1 via the highly regioselective C-3' hydroxylation of polydatin, a resveratrol glucoside. (E)-astringin is a high added value compound found in plants and wine. Benzylic hydroxylation of polydatin provides an attractive route to (E)-astringin, a catechol product. Thus far, chemical and enzymatic methods of producing (E)-astringin have not been developed.

The reactions were thoroughly characterized, determining the kinetic parameters and the equilibrium dissociation constant. The observed lower conversion rate in the case of dexamethasone hydroxylation was clarified by quantum chemical calculations, which suggest a rearrangement of the intermediately formed radical species.

27849620	10.1073/pnas.1613610113	An HD domain phosphohydrolase active site tailored for oxetanocin-A biosynthesis.	HD domain phosphohydrolase enzymes are characterized by a conserved set of histidine and aspartate residues that coordinate an active site metallocenter. Despite the important roles these enzymes play in nucleotide metabolism and signal transduction, few have been both biochemically and structurally characterized. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures and biochemical characterization of the Bacillus megaterium HD domain phosphohydrolase OxsA, involved in the biosynthesis of the antitumor, antiviral, and antibacterial compound oxetanocin-A. These studies reveal a previously uncharacterized reaction for this family; OxsA catalyzes the conversion of a triphosphorylated compound into a nucleoside, releasing one molecule of inorganic phosphate at a time. Remarkably, this functionality is a result of the OxsA active site, which based on structural and kinetic analyses has been tailored to bind the small, four-membered ring of oxetanocin-A over larger substrates.

In the current work, we describe the identification and characterization of the first plasmid-encoded P450 (CYP107DY1) from a Bacillus species. The recombinant CYP107DY1 exhibits characteristic P450 absolute and reduced CO-bound difference spectra. Reconstitution with different redox systems revealed the autologous one, consisting of BmCPR and Fdx2, as the most effective one. Screening of a library of 18 pharmaceutically relevant compounds displayed activity towards mevastatin to produce pravastatin. Pravastatin is an important therapeutic drug to treat hypercholesterolemia, which was described to be produced by oxyfunctionlization of mevastatin (compactin) by members of CYP105 family. The hydroxylation at C6 of mevastatin was also suggested by docking this compound into a computer model created for CYP107DY1. Moreover, in view of the biotechnological application, CYP107DY1 as well as its redox partners (BmCPR and Fdx2) were successfully utilized to establish an E. coli based whole-cel	2017	2	15	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial cytochrome P450; BmCPR; CYP107 family; Fdx2; Mevastatin; Pravastatin; Bacillus megaterium; Biotransformation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Escherichia coli; Hydroxylation; Lovastatin; Plasmids; Pravastatin; Substrate Specificity	Milhim	Mohammed

Bioleaching of Au from mobile phone printed circuit boards (MPPCBs) was studied, using Bacillus megaterium which is a cyanogenic bacterium. To maximize Au extraction, initial pH, pulp density, and glycine concentration were optimized via response surface methodology (RSM). Bioleaching of Cu, an important inhibitor on Au recovery, was also examined. To maximize Au recovery, the optimal condition suggested by the models was initial pH of 10, pulp density of 8.13g/l, and glycine concentration of 10g/l. Under the optimal condition, approximately 72% of Cu and 65g Au/ton MPPCBs, which is 7 times greater than the recovery from gold mines, was extracted. Cu elimination from the MPPCBs having a rich content of Au did not cause a significant effect on Au recovery. It was found that when the ratio of Cu to Au is high, Cu elimination can considerably improve Au recovery. B. megaterium could extract the total Au from PCBs containing 130g Au/ton MPPCBs.	2017	4	24	Waste Manag	Waste management (New York, N.Y.)

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are key components of innate immunity and are widespread in nature, from bacteria to vertebrate animals. In crustaceans, there are currently 15 distinct AMP families published so far in the literature, mainly isolated from members of the Decapoda order. Up to now, armadillidin is the sole non-decapod AMP isolated from the haemocytes of Armadillidium vulgare, a crustacean isopod. Its first description demonstrated that armadillidin is a linear glycine-rich (47%) cationic peptide with an antimicrobial activity directed toward Bacillus megaterium. In the present work, we report identification of armadillidin Q, a variant of armadillidin H (earlier known as armadillidin), from crude haemocyte extracts of A. vulgare using LC-MS approach. We demonstrated that both armadillidins displayed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi, but were totally inactive against yeasts.

Phytophthora species are known as "plant destroyers" capable of initiating single zoospore infection in the presence of a quorum of chemical signals from the same or closely related species of oomycetes. Since the natural oomycete population is too low to reach a quorum necessary to initiate a disease epidemic, creation of the quorum is reliant on alternate sources.

The gelation progression and gel properties of enzymatically crosslinked soy glycinin were evaluated in comparison to non-crosslinked glycinin. Glycinin was initially crosslinked using tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (TyrBm) and was later used to form gel upon heating. Gelation was evaluated by small deformation rheological measurements and revealed a significant increase in storage modulus (G') obtained in the crosslinked gel. This was confirmed by temperature sweep and frequency sweep measurements that supported the results and proved that the difference in modulus was not frequency dependent. Texture profile analysis showed an increase in hardness and decrease in elasticity of the crosslinked gels. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed a more structural network with larger pore size in the crosslinked gel. The less dense structure of the crosslinked glycinin gel network led to a slight decrease in the water holding capacity.

27567486	10.1016/bs.apcsb.2016.07.003	Cytochromes P450: History, Classes, Catalytic Mechanism, and Industrial Application.	Cytochromes P450, a family of heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze a diverse range of oxidative reactions, are so-called due to their maximum absorbance at 450nm, ie, "Pigment-450nm," when bound to carbon monoxide. They have appeal both academically and commercially due to their high degree of regio- and stereoselectivity, for example, in the area of active pharmaceutical ingredient synthesis. Despite this potential, they often exhibit poor stability, low turnover numbers and typically require electron transport protein(s) for catalysis. P450 systems exist in a variety of functional domain architectures, organized into 10 classes. P450s are also divided into families, each of which is based solely on amino acid sequence homology. Their catalytic mechanism employs a very complex, multistep catalytic cycle involving a range of transient intermediates. Mutagenesis is a powerful tool for the development of improved biocatalysts and has been used extensively with the archetypal Clas	2017	6	6	Adv Protein Chem Struct Biol	Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology	(+)-Nootkatone; 1..,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3; APIs; CYP; Ferredoxin; Flavodoxin; Flavoprotein; Hydroxylations; P450cam; Pravastatin; Protoporphyrin IX; Uncoupling; Catalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Industry	Cook	D J

In this study, three bacteria with high Fe- and Mn-oxidizing capabilities were isolated from groundwater well sludge and identified as Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus megaterium and Sphingobacterium sp. The maximum removal ratios of Fe and Mn (99.75% and 96.69%) were obtained by an optimal combination of the bacteria at a temperature of 20.15..C, pH 7.09 and an inoculum size of 2.08%. Four lab-scale biofilters were tested in parallel for the removal of iron and manganese ions from groundwater. The results indicated that the Fe/Mn removal ratios of biofilter R4, which was inoculated with iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria and a biofilm-forming bacterium, were approximately 95% for each metal during continuous operation and were better than the other biofilters. This study demonstrated that the biofilm-forming bacterium could promote the immobilization of the iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria on the biofilters and enhance the removal efficiency of iron and manganese ions from ground	2017	2	9	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Biofilm; Biofilter; Groundwater; Immobilization; Iron- and manganese-oxidizing bacteria; Bacteria; Biofilms; Groundwater; Iron; Manganese; Sewage; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical	Li	Chunyan

27522533	10.1016/j.bjm.2016.07.004	Enzymatic potential of heterotrophic bacteria from a neutral copper mine drainage.	Copper mine drainages are restricted environments that have been overlooked as sources of new biocatalysts for bioremediation and organic syntheses. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the enzymatic activities (esterase, epoxide hydrolase and monooxygenase) of 56 heterotrophic bacteria isolated from a neutral copper mine drainage (Sossego Mine, Cana.. dos Caraj..s, Brazil). Hydrolase and monooxygenase activities were detected in 75% and 20% of the evaluated bacteria, respectively. Bacterial strains with good oxidative performance were also evaluated for biotransformation of organic sulfides. Fourteen strains with good enzymatic activity were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing the presence of three genera: Bacillus, Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas. The bacterial strains B. megaterium (SO5-4 and SO6-2) and Pseudomonas sp. (SO5-9) efficiently oxidized three different organic sulfides to their corresponding sulfoxides.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase constitutes a significant group of oxidative enzymes that can introduce an oxygen atom in a high regio- and stereo-selectivity mode. We used the Bacillus megaterium cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP450 BM3) and its variants namely mutant 13 (M13) and mutant 15 (M15) for the hydroxylation of diverse class of flavonoids. Among 20 flavonoids, maximum seven flavonoids were hydroxylated by the variants while none of these molecules were accepted by CYP450 BM3 in in vitro reaction. Moreover, M13 exhibited higher conversion of substrates than M15 and CYP450 BM3 enzymes. We found that M13 carried out regiospecific 3'-hydroxylation reaction of naringenin with the highest conversion among all the tested flavonoids.

27458582	10.3389/fbioe.2016.00057	Fusion to Hydrophobin HFBI Improves the Catalytic Performance of a Cytochrome P450 System.	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) are heme-containing enzymes that oxidize a broad range of substrates in the presence of molecular oxygen and NAD(P)H. For their activity, most P450s rely on one or two redox proteins responsible for the transfer of electrons from the cofactor NAD(P)H to the heme. One of the challenges when using P450s in vitro, especially when non-physiological redox proteins are applied, is the inefficient transfer of electrons between the individual proteins resulting in non-productive consumption of NAD(P)H - referred to as uncoupling. Herein, we describe the improvement of the coupling efficiency between a P450 and its redox partner - diflavin reductase - by fusing both enzymes individually to the hydrophobin HFBI - a small self-assembling protein of the fungus Trichoderma reesei. The separated monooxygenase (BMO) and reductase (BMR) domains of P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium were chosen as a P450-reductase model system and individually fused to HFBI.

An efficient and stereospecific enzymatic synthesis of 1..-OH-DCA was developed using a Bacillus megaterium (BM3) cytochrome P450 (P450) mutant, and its structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A [(2)H4]-labeled analog of 1..-OH-DCA was also prepared.

The present study applied the PacBio single molecule, real-time sequencing technology (SMRT) in evaluating the quality of silage production. Specifically, we produced four types of Medicago sativa silages by using four different lactic acid bacteria-based additives (AD-I, AD-II, AD-III and AD-IV). We monitored the changes in pH, organic acids (including butyric acid, the ratio of acetic acid/lactic acid, ..-aminobutyric acid, 4-hyroxy benzoic acid and phenyl lactic acid), mycotoxins, and bacterial microbiota during silage fermentation. Our results showed that the use of the additives was beneficial to the silage fermentation by enhancing a general pH and mycotoxin reduction, while increasing the organic acids content. By SMRT analysis of the microbial composition in eight silage samples, we found that the bacterial species number and relative abundances shifted apparently after fermentation. Such changes were specific to the LAB species in the additives.

Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria can improve plant growth, development, and stress adaptation. However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unclear. We investigated the effects of Bacillus megaterium BOFC15 on Arabidopsis plants. BOFC15 produced and secreted spermidine (Spd), a type of polyamine (PA) that plays an important role in plant growth. Moreover, BOFC15 induced changes in the cellular PAs of plants that promoted an increase of free Spd and spermine levels. However, these effects were remarkably abolished by the addition of dicyclohexylamine (DCHA), a Spd biosynthetic inhibitor. Additionally, the inoculation with BOFC15 remarkably increased plant biomass, improved root system architecture, and augmented photosynthetic capacity. Inoculated plants also displayed stronger ability to tolerate drought stress than non-inoculated (control) plants.

27304705	10.1089/ast.2015.1419	Germination of Spores of Astrobiologically Relevant Bacillus Species in High-Salinity Environments.	In times of increasing space exploration and search for extraterrestrial life, new questions and challenges for planetary protection, aiming to avoid forward contamination of different planets or moons with terrestrial life, are emerging. Spore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus species have a high contamination potential due to their spores' extreme resistance, enabling them to withstand space conditions. Spores require liquid water for their conversion into a growing cell (i.e., spore germination and subsequent growth). If present, water on extraterrestrial planets or moons is likely to be closely associated with salts (e.g., in salty oceans or brines), thus constituting high-salinity environments. Spores of Bacillus subtilis can germinate despite very high salt concentrations, although salt stress does exert negative effects on this process.

The interaction between the enteric microbiota and intestinal cells often involves signal molecules that affect both microbial behaviour and host responses. Examples of such signal molecules are the molecules secreted by bacteria that induce quorum sensing mechanisms in the producing microorganism and signal transduction pathways in the host cells. The pentapeptide competence and sporulation factor (CSF) of Bacillus subtilis is a well characterized quorum sensing factor that controls competence and spore formation in the producing bacterium and induces cytoprotective heat shock proteins in intestinal epithelial cells. We analysed several Bacillus strains isolated from human ileal biopsies of healthy volunteers and observed that some of them were unable to produce CSF but still able to act in a CSF-like fashion on model intestinal epithelial cells.

Tyrosinases, copper-containing monooxygenases, are widely used enzymes for industrial, medical, and environmental applications. We report the first functional surface display of Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase on Bacillus subtilis spores using CotE as an anchor protein. Flow Cytometry was used to verify surface expression of tyrosinase on the purified spores. Moreover, tyrosinase activity of the displayed enzyme on B. subtilis spores was monitored in the presence of L-tyrosine (substrate) and CuSO4 (inducer).

27267136	10.1021/acs.biochem.6b00183	Effect of Mutation and Substrate Binding on the Stability of Cytochrome P450BM3 Variants.	Cytochrome P450BM3 is a heme-containing enzyme from Bacillus megaterium that exhibits high monooxygenase activity and has a self-sufficient electron transfer system in the full-length enzyme. Its potential synthetic applications drive protein engineering efforts to produce variants capable of oxidizing nonnative substrates such as pharmaceuticals and aromatic pollutants. However, promiscuous P450BM3 mutants often exhibit lower stability, thereby hindering their industrial application. This study demonstrated that the heme domain R47L/F87V/L188Q/E267V/F81I pentuple mutant (PM) is destabilized because of the disruption of hydrophobic contacts and salt bridge interactions. This was directly observed from crystal structures of PM in the presence and absence of ligands (palmitic acid and metyrapone). The instability of the tertiary structure and heme environment of substrate-free PM was confirmed by pulse proteolysis and circular dichroism, respectively.

Strains of Bacillus subtilis are plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) of many crops and are used as inoculants. PGPB colonization is an important trait for success of a PGPB on plants. A specific probe, based on the 16 s rRNA of Bacillus subtilis, was designed and evaluated to distinguishing, by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), between this species and the closely related Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The selected target for the probe was between nucleotides 465 and 483 of the gene, where three different nucleotides can be identified. The designed probe successfully hybridized with several strains of Bacillus subtilis, but failed to hybridize not only with B. amyloliquefaciens, but also with other strains such as Bacillus altitudinis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus gibsonii, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus; and with the external phylogenetic strains Azospirillum brasilense Cd, Micrococcus sp. and Paenibacillus sp.

The regioselective terminal hydroxylation of alkanes and fatty acids is of great interest in a variety of industrial applications, such as in cosmetics, in fine chemicals, and in the fragrance industry. The chemically challenging activation and oxidation of non-activated C-H bonds can be achieved with cytochrome P450 enzymes. CYP153AM.aq. -CPRBM3 is an artificial fusion construct consisting of the heme domain from Marinobacter aquaeolei and the reductase domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium. It has the ability to hydroxylate medium- and long-chain fatty acids selectively at their terminal positions. However, the activity of this interesting P450 construct needs to be improved for applications in industrial processes. For this purpose, the design of mutant libraries including two consecutive steps of mutagenesis is demonstrated. Targeted positions and residues chosen for substitution were based on semi-rational protein design after creation of a homology model of the heme domain 	2017	5	15	Chembiochem	Chembiochem : a European journal of chemical biology	CYP153A mutant libraries; fatty acids; hydroxylation; protein engineering; whole-cell catalysis; Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Fatty Acids; Hydroxylation; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Protein Engineering	Notonier	Sandra

A variety of microbial communities exist throughout the human and animal body. Genetics, environmental factors and long-term dietary habit contribute to shaping the composition of the gut microbiota. For this reason the study of the gut microbiota of a mammal exhibiting an extraordinary life span is of great importance. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is a eusocial mammal known for its longevity and cancer resistance. Here we analyzed its gut microbiota by cultivating the bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and identifying their species by mass spectrometry. Altogether, 29 species of microbes were identified, predominantly belonging to Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. The most frequent species were Bacillus megaterium (45.2..%), followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (19.4..%), Bacteroides ovatus, Staphylococcus sciuri and Paenibacillus spp., each with a frequency of 16.1..%.

27238232	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.05.035	A Novel NADPH-dependent flavoprotein reductase from Bacillus megaterium acts as an efficient cytochrome P450 reductase.	Cytochromes P450 (P450s) require electron transfer partners to catalyze substrate conversions. With regard to biotechnological approaches, the elucidation of novel electron transfer proteins is of special interest, as they can influence the enzymatic activity and specificity of the P450s. In the current work we present the identification and characterization of a novel soluble NADPH-dependent diflavin reductase from Bacillus megaterium with activity towards a bacterial (CYP106A1) and a microsomal (CYP21A2) P450 and, therefore, we referred to it as B. megaterium cytochrome P450 reductase (BmCPR). Sequence analysis of the protein revealed besides the conserved FMN-, FAD- and NADPH-binding motifs, the presence of negatively charged cluster, which is thought to represent the interaction domain with P450s and/or cytochrome c.

Salt-induced soil degradation is common in farmlands and limits the growth and development of numerous crop plants in the world. In this study, we isolated salt-tolerant bacteria from the rhizosphere of Tamarix chinensis, Suaeda salsa and Zoysia sinica, which are common wild plants grown on a saline-alkaline land, to test these bacteria's efficiency in alleviating salt stress in tomato plants. We screened out seven strains (TF1-7) that are efficient in reducing salt stress in tomato seedlings. The sequence data of 16S rRNA genes showed that these strains belong to Arthrobacter and Bacillus megaterium. All strains could hydrolyze casein and solubilize phosphate, and showed at least one plant growth promotion (PGP)-related gene, indicating their potential in promoting plant growth. The Arthrobacter strains TF1 and TF7 and the Bacillus megaterium strain TF2 and TF3 could produce indole acetic acid under salt stress, further demonstrating their PGP potential.

27157571	10.3168/jds.2015-10702	Effects of different heat treatments on lysozyme quantity and antimicrobial activity of jenny milk.	Thermal treatments are used to improve milk microbial safety, shelf life, and biological activity of some of its components. However, thermal treatments can reduce the nutritional quality of milk, affecting the molecular structure of milk proteins, such as lysozyme, which is a very important milk component due to its antimicrobial effect against gram-positive bacteria. Jenny milk is characterized by high lysozyme content. For this reason, in the last few years, it has been used as an antimicrobial additive in dairy products as an alternative to hen egg white lysozyme, which can cause allergic reactions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pasteurization and condensation on the concentration and antimicrobial activity of lysozyme in jenny milk. Furthermore, lysozyme quantity and activity were tested in raw and pasteurized milk after condensation at 40 and 20% of the initial volume.

Residues of these drugs can be excreted into milk. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a microbiological method using Bacillus megaterium to detect tetracyclines (chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and tetracycline) in milk. In order to approximate the limits of detection of the bioassay to the Maximum Residue Limit (100..g/l) for milk tetracycline, different concentrations of chloramphenicol (0, 1000, 1500 and 2000..g/l) were tested. The detection limits calculated were similar to the Maximum Residue Limits when a bioassay using B. megaterium ATCC 9885 spores (2.8..10(8)spores/ml) and chloramphenicol (2000..g/l) was utilized. This bioassay detects 105..g/l of chlortetracycline, 100..g/l of oxytetracycline and 134..g/l of tetracycline in 5h. Therefore, this method is suitable to be incorporated into a microbiological multi-residue system for the identification of tetracyclines in milk. 	2017	4	3	Rev Argent Microbiol	Revista Argentina de microbiologia	Antibiotics; Antibi..ticos; Bacillus megaterium; Bioassay; Bioensayo; Detecci..n; Detection; Leche; Milk; Tetraciclinas; Tetracyclines; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Argentina; Bacillus megaterium; Biological Assay; Chloramphenicol; Drug Residues; Food Contamination; Maximum Allowable Concentration; Milk; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spores, Bacterial; Tetracyclines	Tumini	Melisa

Light is a ubiquitous environmental factor serving as an energy source and external stimulus. Here, I review the conserved molecular mechanism of light-inducible production of carotenoids in three nonphototrophic bacteria: Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), Thermus thermophilus HB27, and Bacillus megaterium QM B1551. A MerR family transcriptional regulator, LitR, commonly plays a central role in their light-inducible carotenoid production. Genetic and biochemical studies on LitR proteins revealed a conserved function: LitR in complex with adenosyl B12 (AdoB12) has a light-sensitive DNA-binding activity and thus suppresses the expression of the Crt biosynthesis gene cluster. The in vitro DNA-binding and transcription assays showed that the LitR-AdoB12 complex serves as a repressor allowing transcription initiation by RNA polymerase in response to illumination.

Cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) from Bacillus megaterium is an interesting target for biotechnological applications, because of its vast substrate variety combined with high P450 monooxygenase activity. The low stability in vitro could be overcome by immobilization on surfaces. Here we describe a novel method for immobilization on metal surfaces by using selectively binding peptides. A P450 BM3 triple mutant (3M-P450BM3: A74G, F87V, L188Q) was purified as protein thioester and ligated to indium tin oxide or gold binding peptides (BP) named HighSP-BP and Cys-BP, respectively. The ligation products were characterized by Western Blot and tryptic digestion combined with mass spectrometry, and displayed high affinity binding on the depicted surfaces. Next, we could demonstrate by benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation assay (BROD assay) that the activity of immobilized ligation products is higher than for the soluble form. The study provides a new tool for selective modification and immobilizatio	2017	1	17	Bioconjug Chem	Bioconjugate chemistry	Catalysis; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Enzymes, Immobilized; Peptides; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization	Zernia	Sarah
26966093	10.1186/s12934-016-0448-0	Evaluation of novel inducible promoter/repressor systems for recombinant protein expression in Lactobacillus plantarum.	Engineering lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is of growing importance for food and feed industry as well as for in vivo vaccination or the production of recombinant proteins in food grade organisms. Often, expression of a transgene is only desired at a certain time point or period, e.g. to minimize the metabolic burden for the host cell or to control the expression time span. For this purpose, inducible expression systems are preferred, though cost and availability of the inducing agent must be feasible. We selected the plasmid free strain Lactobacillus plantarum 3NSH for testing and characterization of novel inducible promoters/repressor systems. Their feasibility in recombinant protein production was evaluated. Expression of the reporter protein mCherry was monitored with the BioLector(..) micro-fermentation system.

26956722	10.1186/s12896-016-0257-x	Metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli for the production of hydroxy fatty acids from glucose.	Hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) are valuable chemicals for a broad variety of applications. However, commercial production of HFAs has not been established so far due to the lack of low cost routes for their synthesis. Although the microbial transformation pathway of HFAs was extensively studied decades ago, these attempts mainly focused on converting fatty acids or vegetable oils to their hydroxyl counterparts. The use of a wider range of feedstocks to produce HFAs would reduce the dependence on oil crops and be expected to cut down the manufacturing cost. In this study, the industrially important microorganism Escherichia coli was engineered to produce HFAs directly from glucose. Through the coexpression of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and the leadless acyl-CoA thioesterase ('TesA), and knockout of the endogenous acyl-CoA synthetase (FadD), an engineered E. coli strain was constructed to efficiently synthesize free fatty acids (FFAs).

Phosphate solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC)-deaminase activity and production of siderophores and indole acetic acid (IAA) are well-known traits of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Here we investigated the expression of these traits as affected by salinity for three PGPR strains (Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus megaterium and Variovorax paradoxus) at two salinity levels [2 and 5..% NaCl (w/v)]. Among the three strains, growth of B. megaterium was the least affected by high salinity. However, P. fluorescens was the best strain for maintaining ACC-deaminase activity, siderophore and IAA production under stressed conditions. V. paradoxus was the least tolerant to salts and had minimal growth and low PGPR trait expression under salt stress. Results of experiment examining the impact of bacterial inoculation on cucumber growth at three salinity levels [1 (normal), 7 and 10 dS..m(-1)] revealed that P. fluorescens also had good rhizosphere competence an	2016	9	22	Arch Microbiol	Archives of microbiology	Characterization; Cucumber; Growth; PGPR; Salinity; Stress; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Carbon-Carbon Lyases; Cucumis sativus; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Bacterial; Indoleacetic Acids; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Salinity; Salt Tolerance; Siderophores; Sodium Chloride; Soil Microbiology	Nadeem	Sajid Mahmood

In bacterial resistance to mercury, the organomercurial lyase (MerB) plays a key role in the detoxification pathway through its ability to cleave Hg-carbon bonds. Two cysteines (C96 and C159; Escherichia coli MerB numbering) and an aspartic acid (D99) have been identified as the key catalytic residues, and these three residues are conserved in all but four known MerB variants, where the aspartic acid is replaced with a serine. To understand the role of the active site serine, we characterized the structure and metal binding properties of an E. coli MerB mutant with a serine substituted for D99 (MerB D99S) as well as one of the native MerB variants containing a serine residue in the active site (Bacillus megaterium MerB2). Surprisingly, the MerB D99S protein copurified with a bound metal that was determined to be Cu(II) from UV-vis absorption, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance studies.

Microorganisms on and within organisms are ubiquitous and interactions with their hosts range from mutualistic over commensal, to pathogenic. We hypothesized that microorganisms might affect the ability of barn swallows Hirundo rustica to escape from potential predators, with positive associations between the abundance of microorganisms and escape ability implying mutualistic effects, while negative associations would imply antagonistic effects. We quantified escape behavior as the ability to avoid capture in a mist net and hence as a small number of recaptures. Because recapture probability may also depend on timing of reproduction and reproductive success, we also tested whether the association between recapture and microorganisms was mediated by an association between recapture and life history.

Germination of spores of these species by all of the germinants investigated was inhibited as aw decreased, with the general order of efficacy for these non-ionic humectants being sucrose..&gt;..trehalose..&gt;..glycerol. The effect of lowering aw on germination by germinant receptor (GR)-dependent germinants was not appreciably altered by varying germinant concentrations, was generally not much more effective with spores lacking coats or an outer membrane, and was less pronounced with heat-activated spores. Analysis of the effect of aw on spore germination via different mechanisms showed that GR-dependent germination was least sensitive to aw, while germination via activation of spor	2018	5	3	Food Microbiol	Food microbiology	Bacillus; High pressure; Spore germination; Spores; Water activity; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Glycerol; Hygroscopic Agents; Peptidoglycan; Spores, Bacterial; Sucrose; Trehalose; Water	Rao	Lei
29259282	10.1038/s41598-017-18125-z	Analysis of killing of growing cells and dormant and germinated spores of Bacillus species by black silicon nanopillars.	Black silicon (bSi) wafers with a high density of high-aspect ratio nanopillars have recently been suggested to have mechanical bactericidal activity. However, it remains unclear whether bSi with the nanopillars can kill only growing bacterial cells or also dormant spores that are harder to kill. We have reexamined the cidal activity of bSi on growing cells, dormant and germinated spores of B. subtilis, and dormant spores of several other Bacillus species by incubation on bSi wafers with and without nanopillars. We found that the bSi wafers with nanopillars were indeed very effective in rupturing and killing the growing bacterial cells, while wafers without nanopillars had no bactericidal effect. However, bSi wafers with or without nanopillars gave no killing or rupture of dormant spores of B. subtilis, Bacillus cereus or Bacillus megaterium, although germinated B. subtilis spores were rapidly killed.

29258002	10.1016/j.watres.2017.12.016	Abiotic degradation and environmental toxicity of ibuprofen: Roles of mineral particles and solar radiation.	The growing medical and personal needs of human populations have escalated release of pharmaceuticals and personal care products into our natural environment. This work investigates abiotic degradation pathways of a particular PPCP, ibuprofen, in the presence of a major mineral component of soil (kaolinite clay), as well as the health effects of the primary compound and its degradation products. Results from these studies showed that the rate and extent of ibuprofen degradation is greatly influenced by the presence of clay particles and solar radiation. In the absence of solar radiation, the dominant reaction mechanism was observed to be the adsorption of ibuprofen onto clay surface where surface silanol groups play a key role. In contrast, under solar radiation and in the presence of clay particles, ibuprofen breaks down to several fractions. The decay rates were at least 6-fold higher for irradiated samples compared to those of dark conditions.

Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) exhibit abundant biomedical applications. Anisotropic ZnONPs with a defined shape and size were synthesized using Bacillus megaterium (NCIM 2326) cell free extract as a bio-reductant. The study investigated the multidimensional effect of ZnONPs on Helicobacter pylori strains and assessed its biosafety in normal human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSc). The highly stable ZnONPs were produced using B. megaterium and Zinc nitrate as a precursor. The phase of ZnONPs formation and structural characterization were performed by UV- visible (UV-Vis), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Field Emission Scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. Furthermore, the ZnONPs exhibited higher biocompatibility against human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and proved to be potentially safe in mammalian cells. Corroborating the current investigation, we described the anti-H.

CYP130 belongs to the subset of cytochrome P450s from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that have been structurally characterized. Despite several efforts for its functional characterization, CYP130 is still considered an orphan enzyme for which no endogenous or exogenous substrate has been identified. In addition, functional redox-partners for CYP130 have not been clearly established yet, hampering the elucidation of its physiological role. In the present study, a catalytically active fusion protein involving CYP130 and the NADPH reductase-domain of CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium was created. By screening a panel of known substrates of human P450s, dextromethorphan N-demethylation was identified as a reaction catalyzed by CYP130. The fusion enzyme showed higher catalytic activity, when compared to CYP130 reconstituted with a selection of non-native redox-partners.

Development of the resistance is the major problem in cancer therapy. Docetaxel is a taxol alkaloid that is frequently used in metastatic breast cancer. However, resistance often limits the usefulness of this drug in many breast cancer patients. Manipulation of resistant cells to re-sensitize to the therapeutic effect of docetaxel is current strategy to overcome this problem. Here, we have introduced 'Iturin A' as a potent chemosensitizer in docetaxel resistant breast cancer cells. Combination of Iturin A and docetaxel treatment significantly hampered the proliferation of docetaxel resistant MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis also showed massive amount of apoptotic population (Sub G0/G1) in combination therapy. A number of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins were significantly altered in dual drug treated groups. Caspase 3 dependent cell death was observed in dual treatment.

Spores of Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus subtilis were found to exhibit intrinsic paramagnetic properties as a result of the accumulation of manganese ions. All three Bacillus species displayed strong yet distinctive magnetic properties arising from differences in manganese quantity and valency. Manganese ions were found to accumulate both within the spore core as well as being associated with the surface of the spore. Bacillus megaterium spores accumulated up to 1...wt.% manganese (II) within, with a further 0.6...wt.% adsorbed onto the surface. At room temperature, Bacillus spores possess average magnetic susceptibilities in the range of 10<sup>-6</sup> to 10<sup>-5</sup> .

Over the last 10-15..years, a technology has been developed to engineer bacterial poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) inclusions as functionalized beads, for applications such as vaccines, diagnostics and enzyme immobilization. This has been achieved by translational fusion of foreign proteins to the PHB synthase (PhaC). The respective fusion protein mediates self-assembly of PHB inclusions displaying the desired protein function. So far, beads have mainly been produced in recombinant Escherichia coli, which is problematic for some applications as the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) co-purified with such inclusions are toxic to humans and animals. In this study, we have bioengineered the formation of functional PHB inclusions in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium, an LPS-free and established industrial production host. As B. megaterium is a natural PHB producer, the PHB-negative strain PHA05 was used to avoid any background PHB production.

Red assay for screening of P450 activities and uncoupling.	Cytochrome P450s belong to a large and diverse group of heme-containing enzymes. These monooxygenases catalyze the incorporation of a single atom of molecular oxygen into their substrate. In contrast to most other enzymes, the activity of P450 enzymes is not only dependent on substrate and cofactor availability and reaction conditions, but also depends on the coupling efficiency of the catalytic cycle itself. Through the electron transfer from NAD(P)H to the heme-center of the P450, the enzyme becomes activated and binds oxygen. The thereby generated iron-oxygen complex undergoes multiple reductive steps forming different activated oxygen species. These intermediates can decay easily, releasing the reactive oxygen species superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which can also be further reduced to water. This so-called uncoupling of the reaction cycle drains electrons from the system, which consequently does not lead to the desired product, but merely H<sub	2019	2	12	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Cytochrome P450; Hydrogen peroxide; N-acetyl-3,7-dihydroxyphenoxazin; P450 BM3; Uncoupling; Bacillus megaterium; Catalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Enzyme Assays; Hydrogen Peroxide; Kinetics; NAD; NADP; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Reactive Oxygen Species	Morlock	Lisa K

High-throughput sequencing data revealed that biofilms formed in the presence of the coaggregating bacteria demonstrated greater microbial diversity. These results suggest that broad-spectrum coaggregating bacteria may be capable of mediating the immobilization of exogenous degrading bacteria into biofilms, rendering them more resistant to toxic compounds and environmental stresses.

The enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) is one of the key enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis. It catalyses the formation of a linear tetrapyrrole from four molecules of the substrate porphobilinogen (PBG). It has a dipyrromethane cofactor (DPM) in the active site which is covalently linked to a conserved cysteine residue through a thioether bridge. The substrate molecules are linked to the cofactor in a stepwise head-to-tail manner during the reaction, which is catalysed by a conserved aspartate residue: Asp82 in the B. megaterium enzyme. Three mutations have been made affecting Asp82 (D82A, D82E and D82N) and their crystal structures have been determined at resolutions of 2.7, 1.8 and 1.9....., respectively. These structures reveal that whilst the D82E mutant possesses the DPM cofactor, in the D82N and D82A mutants the cofactor is likely to be missing, incompletely assembled or disordered.

29055859	10.1016/j.bioelechem.2017.10.005	Flavins mediate extracellular electron transfer in Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium strain LLD-1.	The extracellular electron transfer (EET) mechanism of an isolated Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium strain (LLD-1), identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and physiological analysis, was investigated in the present study. The electrochemical activity of strain LLD-1 was confirmed by electrochemical E-t and amperometric I-t tests. Flavins in culture suspension from strain LLD-1 were further proved to be able to act as electron shuttles, strengthening the electron transfer from LLD-1 to the electrode. The output voltage and current output were increased 2.8 times and 3.7 times, respectively, by adding 100nM exogenetic flavins into microbial fuel cells inoculated with LLD-1. Electricity generation by LLD-1 from different carbon sources can be enhanced by adding 100nM exogenetic flavins. This study indicated that flavins were essential to the EET process of the Gram-positive strain LLD-1. Furthermore, a putative EET model for B. megaterium strain LLD-1 and even for Gram-positive bacteria 	2018	1	3	Bioelectrochemistry	Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)	Bacillus megaterium; Electron shuttle; Extracellular electron transfer; Flavin; Microbial fuel cells; Bacillus megaterium; Electrochemistry; Electron Transport; Extracellular Space; Flavins; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis	You	Le-Xing

29026902	10.1039/c7ob01847a	Exploring the origins of selectivity in soluble epoxide hydrolase from Bacillus megaterium.	Epoxide hydrolase (EH) enzymes catalyze the hydration of racemic epoxides to yield their corresponding vicinal diols. These enzymes present different enantio- and regioselectivity depending upon either the substrate structure or the substitution pattern of the epoxide ring. In this study, we computationally investigate the Bacillus megaterium epoxide hydrolase (BmEH)-mediated hydrolysis of racemic styrene oxide (rac-SO) and its para-nitro styrene oxide (rac-p-NSO) derivative using density functional theory (DFT) and an active site cluster model consisting of 195 and 197 atoms, respectively. Full reaction mechanisms for epoxide ring opening were evaluated considering the attack at both oxirane carbons and considering two possible orientations of the substrate at the BmEH active site. Our results indicate that for both SO and p-NSO substrates the BmEH enantio- and regioselectivity is opposite to the inherent (R)-BmEH selectivity, the attack at the benzylic position (C1) of the (S)-enanti	2018	2	22	Org Biomol Chem	Organic &amp; biomolecular chemistry	Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Epoxide Hydrolases; Epoxy Compounds; Hydrolysis; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Solubility	Serrano-Herv..s	Eila

Vitamin D3 (VD3 ) metabolites are of pharmaceutical importance and are applied for the treatment of VD3 deficiency and other disorders. However, the chemical synthesis of VD3 derivatives shows low specificity and low yields. In this study, cytochrome P450 CYP109A2 from Bacillus megaterium DSM319 was expressed, purified, and shown to oxidize VD3 with high regio-selectivity. The in vitro conversion, using cytochrome P450 reductase (BmCPR) and ferredoxin (Fdx2) from the same strain, showed typical Michaelis-Menten reaction kinetics.

28870733	10.1016/j.bbapap.2017.08.010	Functionalized poly(3-hydroxybutyric acid) bodies as new in vitro biocatalysts.	Cytochromes P450 play a key role in the drug and steroid metabolism in the human body. This leads to a high interest in this class of proteins. Mammalian cytochromes P450 are rather delicate. Due to their localization in the mitochondrial or microsomal membrane, they tend to aggregate during expression and purification and to convert to an inactive form so that they have to be purified and stored in complex buffers. The complex buffers and low storage temperatures, however, limit the feasibility of fast, automated screening of the corresponding cytochrome P450-effector interactions, which are necessary to study substrate-protein and inhibitor-protein interactions. Here, we present the production and isolation of functionalized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) granules (PHB bodies) from Bacillus megaterium MS941 strain.

Most bacterial cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s or CYPs) require two redox partner proteins for activity.

Bacteria have developed various mechanisms by which they sense, interact, and kill other bacteria, in an attempt to outcompete one another and survive.

Furthermore, utilizing the methionine analogue L-azidohomoalanine as a nutrient reporter, we provide evidence of nutrient extraction from Bacillus megaterium by Bacillus subtilis. Toxin delivery and nutrient extraction occur in a contact-dependent manner, and both activities are abolished in the absence of the phosphodiestrase YmdB, shown previously to mediate intercellular nanotube formation. Furthermore, we detect the localization of WapA molecules to nanotubes.

We found seed coating by such rhizobacterial strains at a ratio of 3:1:1 (thereafter called SN101) produced the highest germination rate and the mortality of J2 of nematodes. Then, the role of soybean seed coating by SN101 in nematode control was evaluated under both greenhouse and two field conditions in Northeast China in 2013 and 2014. Our results showed that SN101 treatment greatly reduced SCN reproduction and significantly promoted plant growth and yield production in both greenhouse and field trials, suggesting that SN101 is a promising seed-coating agent that may be used as an alternative bio-nematicide for controlling SCN in soybean fields.

The current research was performed to evaluate the effect of Bacillus megaterium MCR-8 on mitigation of nickel (Ni) stress in Vinca rosea grown on Ni-contaminated soil (50, 100, and 200..mg Ni kg<sup>-1</sup> soil). The treated plants exhibited reduced growth, biomass, gas exchange capacity, and chlorophyll (Chl) content under Ni stress. The inoculated plants growing in Ni-contaminated media exhibited relatively higher growth, total soluble protein, and proline contents. Similarly, bacterial inoculation improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) under Ni stress. The Ni stress alleviation in inoculated plants was attributed to the reduced level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), enhanced synthesis of protein, proline, phenols, and flavonides in conjunction with improved activity of antioxidant enzymes.

28690168	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.07.014	PEGylation of cytochrome P450 enhances its biocatalytic performance for pesticide transformation.	Pesticide intoxication is a major public health concern, and unfortunately there is not an effective treatment for severe organophosphorus pesticide intoxication. In this work, a non-immunogenic enzymatic bioconjugate based on cytochrome P450 was assayed for organophosphorus pesticide transformation. Enzyme therapy is an alternative approach to inactivate pesticides in the bloodstream, transforming them into less toxic metabolites. A variant of cytochrome P450 (CYPBM3 F87A) from Bacillus megaterium was chemically modified with polyethylene glycol. The PEGylated enzyme showed enhanced pesticide transformation activity when compared with the unmodified protein. The transformation rates were higher than those obtained with the unmodified enzyme for all six pesticides transformed. The specific activity of PEGylated preparation for parathion and dichlorophen was up to 9-times higher than these obtained with the unmodified enzyme. In addition, the modified CYP (CYP-PEG) remained a	2018	7	6	Int J Biol Macromol	International journal of biological macromolecules	CYP; Cytochrome P450; PEG; Pesticide transformation; Polyethylene glycol; Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Biotransformation; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Macrophages; Mice; Models, Molecular; Oxidation-Reduction; Pesticides; Polyethylene Glycols; Protein Conformation; RAW 264.7 Cells; Substrate Specificity; Temperature	Alejo-Gonz..lez	Karla
28689401	10.1021/acs.biochem.7b00432	Hole Hopping through Tryptophan in Cytochrome P450.	Electron-transfer kinetics have been measured in four conjugates of cytochrome P450 with surface-bound Ru-photosensitizers. The conjugates are constructed with enzymes from Bacillus megaterium (CYP102A1) and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (CYP119). A W96 residue lies in the path between Ru and the heme in CYP102A1, whereas H76 is present at the analogous location in CYP119. Two additional conjugates have been prepared with (CYP102A1)W96H and (CYP119)H76W mutant enzymes. Heme oxidation by photochemically generated Ru<sup>3+</sup> leads to P450 compound II formation when a tryptophan residue is in the path between Ru and the heme; no heme oxidation is observed when histidine occupies this position. The data indicate that heme oxidation proceeds via two-step tunneling through a tryptophan radical intermediate. In contrast, heme reduction by photochemically generated Ru<sup>+</sup> proceeds in a single electron tunneling step with closely similar rate constants for all four conjugates.	2017	8	4	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Archaeal Proteins; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Electron Transport; Heme; Models, Molecular; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosensitizing Agents; Ruthenium; Sulfolobus acidocaldarius; Tryptophan	Ener	Maraia E

Betulinic acid as a derivative of betulin is widely reported for its anti-HIV and antitumor activities. Betulin has three most significant positions, i.e., primary hydroxyl group at position C-28, secondary hydroxyl group at position C-3, and alkene moiety at position C-20, where chemical modifications were performed to yield pharmacologically more active derivatives. Bioconversion optimization was performed for the enhancement in the percentage of conversion using statistical approach by opting temperature, pH and betulin concentration as independent variables. Three hundred fifty isolates were screened from natural sources under selective medium containing up to 3..g/l of betulin for their tolerance and bioconversion efficiency. Isolate KD235 was found to grow in 3..g/l betulin with 23.34......0.57..g/l biomass and 0.67......0.06..g/l betulinic acid production.

Endophytic bacteria reside in plant tissues, such as roots, stems, leaves and seeds. Most of them can stimulate plant growth or alleviate phytotoxicity of pollutants. There are handful species with dual functions stimulating plant growth and degrading pollutants have been reported. Five endophytic bacteria were isolated from chlorpyrifos (CP) treated rice plants and identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain RRA, Bacillus megaterium strain RRB, Sphingobacterium siyangensis strain RSA, Stenotrophomonas pavanii strain RSB and Curtobacterium plantarum strain RSC according to morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, and 16S rDNA phylogeny. All of them possessed some plant growth promotional traits, including indole acetic acid and siderophore production, secretion of phosphate solubilization and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase.

A three-year field monoculture trial of Radix pseudostellariae and complementary laboratory studies were conducted to further elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for significant decreases in the biomass yield and quality of R. pseudostellariae under continuous monoculture regimes. HPLC analysis indicated that continuous monoculture soil was rich in organic acids, which had cumulative effects over time. Further analysis suggested that the application of a mixture of organic acids significantly promoted growth of pathogenic fungi, and increased the expression of chemotaxis-related gene (cheA) and biofilm formation of the specific pathogenic Kosakonia sacchari. However, opposite reactions were observed in the case of Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus pumilus. Concurrently, the present results revealed that the mixed organic acids stimulated the production of toxins, as well as H2O2 in the pathogenic fungi.

The genome of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a herbivore, is missing important elements of the canonical Drosophila immune pathways necessary to fight bacterial infections. However, it is not known whether spider mites can mount an immune response and survive bacterial infection. In other chelicerates, bacterial infection elicits a response mediated by immune effectors leading to the survival of infected organisms. In T. urticae, infection by either Escherichia coli or Bacillus megaterium did not elicit a response as assessed through genome-wide transcriptomic analysis. In line with this, spider mites died within days even upon injection with low doses of bacteria that are non-pathogenic to Drosophila Moreover, bacterial populations grew exponentially inside the infected spider mites.

Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are soil micro-organisms able to interact with plants and stimulate their growth, positively affecting plant physiology and development. Although ethylene plays a key role in plant growth, little is known about the involvement of ethylene sensitivity in bacterial inoculation effects on plant physiology. Thus, the present study was pursued to establish whether ethylene perception is critical for plant-bacteria interaction and growth induction by two different PGPB strains, and to assess the physiological effects of these strains in juvenile and mature tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) plants. An experiment was performed with the ethylene-insensitive tomato never ripe and its isogenic wild-type line in which these two strains were inoculated with either Bacillus megaterium or Enterobacter sp.

Bacterial levansucrases produce ..(2,6)-linked levan-type polysaccharides using sucrose or sucrose analogs as donor/acceptor substrates. However, the dominant reaction of Bacillus megaterium levansucrase (Bm-LS) is hydrolysis. Single domain levansucrases from Gram-positive bacteria display a wide substrate-binding pocket with open access to water, challenging engineering for transfructosylation-efficient enzymes. We pursued a shift in reaction specificity by either modifying the water distribution in the active site or the coordination of the catalytic acid/base (E352) and the nucleophile (D95), thus affecting the fructosyl-transfer rate and allowing acceptors other than water to occupy the active site. Two serine (173/422) and two water-binding tyrosine (421/439) residues located in the first shell of the catalytic pocket were modified.

Tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (TyrBm) was previously used to modulate soy glycinin-based emulsions and gels. To study the crosslinking mechanism, TyrBm oxidation of three tyrosine-containing octapeptides derived from glycinin was analyzed by oxygen consumption measurements, absorbance and mass spectrometry. A significant lag period and lower activity were measured when tyrosine was located in the middle of the peptide chain. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that these peptides are crosslinked via the oxidative quinone ring of the tyrosine residue by aryl-alkylamine addition or aryloxy radical coupling to form di-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine). In contrast, peptides containing tyrosine in the N- or C-terminus, were rapidly oxidized forming multimer units within thirty minutes. When small amino acids were adjacent to the terminus tyrosine, formation of di-tyrosine was observed.

28438599	10.1016/j.dci.2017.04.017	Newly identified invertebrate-type lysozyme (Splys-i) in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) exhibiting muramidase-deficient antimicrobial activity.	Lysozymes are widely distributed immune effectors exerting muramidase activity against the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall to trigger cell lysis. However, some invertebrate-type (i-type) lysozymes deficient of muramidase activity still exhibit antimicrobial activity. To date, the mechanism underlying the antimicrobial effect of muramidase-deficient i-type lysozymes remains unclear. Accordingly, this study characterized a novel i-type lysozyme, Splys-i, in the mud crab Scylla paramamosain. Splys-i shared the highest identity with the Litopenaeus vannamei i-type lysozyme (Lvlys-i2, 54% identity) at the amino acid level. Alignment analysis and 3D structure comparison show that Splys-i may be a muramidase-deficient i-type lysozyme because it lacks the two conserved catalytic residues (Glu and Asp) that are necessary for muramidase activity. Splys-i is mainly distributed in the intestine, stomach, gills, hepatopancreas, and hemocytes, and it is upregulated by Vibrio harveyi or Stap	2018	3	9	Dev Comp Immunol	Developmental and comparative immunology	Agglutinating activity; Antimicrobial activity; Binding activity; Expression profiles; Invertebrate-type lysozyme; Isopeptidase activity; Agglutination; Animals; Anti-Infective Agents; Arthropod Proteins; Brachyura; Candidiasis; Carbon-Nitrogen Lyases; Cell Growth Processes; Cloning, Molecular; Immunity, Innate; Intestinal Mucosa; Lipopolysaccharides; Muramidase; Protein Binding; Proteoglycans; Sequence Alignment; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Vibrio; Vibrio Infections	Zhou	Jian

The influence of variable culture conditions on the size and wet density of spores of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus megaterium were examined in this work. Culture temperature and initial pH was shown to have a significant impact on the size of both species, with increasingly alkaline culture media and elevated culture temperatures resulting in spores that were, on average, up to 25% reduced in volume. Increasing concentrations of inorganic salts in sporulation media exerted differing effects on each species; whereas a fivefold increase in the concentration of all salts resulted in only minor differences to the dimensions of B...cereus spores, B...megaterium spores became more elongated, displaying an average increase in volume of almost 30%. Similarly, as the spore elongated to yield aspect ratios larger than 1..4, their shape changed from typical prolate spheroids to cylinders with hemispherical ends.

This paper presents the results of in situ studies on solubilization of different phosphorus-bearing raw materials by application of natural ability to produce organic acids by Bacillus megaterium. Poultry bones as well as fish bones were used as renewable sources of phosphates. Morocco phosphorite was used as nonrenewable sources of phosphates. Glass columns, filled with the soil mixed with different doses (1, 5, and 10%) of mentioned sources of phosphorus, were used as a medium for solubilization. It was found that the amount of released phosphorus (determined in the eluent and expressed as P2O5) significantly increased in the cases of columns where B. megaterium was used, when compared with the control group (without microflora). Higher doses of phosphorus-bearing material used in the experiment influenced in the release of higher amount of phosphorus.

Umbelliferone, also known as 7-hydroxycoumarin, is a phenolic metabolite found in many familiar plants. Its derivatives have been shown to have various pharmacological and chemo-preventive effects on human health. A uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase YjiC from Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13, a cytochrome P450BM3 (CYP450 BM3) variant namely mutant 13 (M13) from Bacillus megaterium, and an O-methyltransferase from Streptomyces avermitilis (SaOMT2) were used for modifications of umbelliferone. Three umbelliferone derivatives (esculetin, skimmin, and herniarin) were generated through enzymatic and whole cell catalysis. To improve the efficiencies of biotransformation, different media, incubation time and concentration of substrate were optimized and the production was scaled up using a 3-L fermentor. The maximum yields of esculetin, skimmin, and herniarin were 337.10....M (67.62%), 995.43....M (99.54%), and 37.13....M (37.13%), respectively.

Large accumulation of nitrate in soil has resulted in "salt stress" and soil secondary salinization. Bacillus megaterium NCT-2 which was isolated from secondary salinization soil showed high capability of nitrate reduction. The genes encoding assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reductase from NCT-2 were cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The optimum co-expression condition was obtained with E. coli BL21 (DE3) and 0.1mM IPTG for 10h when expression was carried out at 20..C and 120rpm in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The molecular mass of nitrate reductase was 87.3kDa and 80.5kDa for electron transfer and catalytic subunit, respectively. The large and small subunit of nitrite reductase was 88kDa and 11.7kDa, respectively. The purified recombinant enzymes showed broad activity range of temperature and pH.

Human liver cytochrome P450 3A4 is the main enzyme involved in drug metabolism. This makes it an attractive target for biocatalytic applications, such as the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and drug metabolites. However, its poor solubility, stability and low coupling have limited its application in the biotechnological context. We previously demonstrated that the solubility of P450 3A4 can be increased by creating fusion proteins between the reductase from Bacillus megaterium BM3 (BMR) and the N-terminally modified P450 3A4 (3A4-BMR). In this work, we aim at increasing stability and coupling efficiency by varying the length of the loop connecting the two domains to allow higher inter-domain flexibility, optimizing the interaction between the domains. Starting from the construct 3A4-BMR containing the short linker Pro-Ser-Arg, two constructs were generated by introducing a 3 and 5 glycine hinge (3A4-3GLY-BMR and 3A4-5GLY-BMR).

Development of potential inhibitors of this signaling is emerging area for discovery of novel cancer therapeutics. In the current investigation, we identified Iturin A (A lipopeptide molecule from Bacillus megaterium) as a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and cancer invasion by various in vitro and in vivo methods. Iturin A was found to suppress VEGF, a powerful inducer of angiogenesis and key player in tumor invasion, as confirmed by ELISA, western blot and real time PCR. Iturin A inhibited endothelial tube arrangement, blood capillary formation, endothelial sprouting and vascular growth inside the matrigel.

28346939	10.1038/nature21689	A B<sub>12</sub>-dependent radical SAM enzyme involved in oxetanocin A biosynthesis.	Oxetanocin A (OXT-A) is a potent antitumour, antiviral and antibacterial compound. Biosynthesis of OXT-A has been linked to a plasmid-borne Bacillus megaterium gene cluster that contains four genes: oxsA, oxsB, oxrA and oxrB. Here we show that both the oxsA and oxsB genes are required for the production of OXT-A. Biochemical analysis of the encoded proteins, a cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) radical enzyme, OxsB, and an HD-domain phosphohydrolase, OxsA, reveals that OXT-A is derived from a 2'-deoxyadenosine phosphate in an OxsB-catalysed ring contraction reaction initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from C2'. Hence, OxsB represents the first biochemically characterized non-methylating Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme. X-ray analysis of OxsB reveals the fold of a Cbl-dependent AdoMet radical enzyme, a family of enzymes with an estimated 7,000 members.

28292630	10.1016/j.bjm.2017.02.002	A plate method for rapid screening of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare mutants for enhanced 2-keto-l-gulonic acid production.	A new plate method was developed for rapid screening of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare mutants overproducing 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (2-KLG). The screening methodology took the advantage of the acidity caused by 2-KLG, which changes the color of bromothymol blue (pH indicator) from blue to yellow. Using the proposed method, a mutant, K. vulgare 65, was selected from 20,000 colonies produced by a strain subjected to spaceflight mutagenesis. When co-cultured with Bacillus megaterium 2980 in 20-L fermenters, K. vulgare 65 showed a high conversion rate (94.45%) of l-sorbose to 2-KLG. In contrast to the traditional screening method, this one significantly improved the frequency of obtaining positive mutants. The proposed plate screening method is cost-effective and easy to run and is thus useful for the isolation and screening of K. vulgare mutants overproducing 2-KLG.	2018	3	12	Braz J Microbiol	Brazilian journal of microbiology : [publication of the Brazilian Society for Microbiology]	2-Keto-l-gulonic acid; Ketogulonicigenium vulgare; Rapid screening; Spaceflight mutation; pH indicator; Bacteriological Techniques; Fermentation; Mutation; Rhodobacteraceae; Sorbose; Sugar Acids	Yang	Weichao

28115011	10.1186/s12934-017-0625-9	Recombinant production of the antibody fragment D1.3 scFv with different Bacillus strains.	Different strains of the genus Bacillus are versatile candidates for the industrial production and secretion of heterologous proteins. They can be cultivated quite easily, show high growth rates and are usually non-pathogenic and free of endo- and exotoxins. They have the ability to secrete proteins with high efficiency into the growth medium, which allows cost-effective downstream purification processing. Some of the most interesting and challenging heterologous proteins are recombinant antibodies and antibody fragments. They are important and suitable tools in medical research for analytics, diagnostics and therapy.

Alkaline soils with high calcium carbonate and low organic matter are deficient in plant nutrient availability. Use of organic and bio-fertilizers has been suggested to improve their properties. Therefore, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the integrative role of phosphogypsum (PG; added at 0.0, 10, 30, and 50 g PG kg<sup>-1</sup> ), cow manure (CM; added at 50 g kg<sup>-1</sup> ) and mixed microbial inoculation (Incl.; Azotobacter chroococcum, and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria Bacillus megaterium var. phosphaticum and Pseudomonas fluorescens) on growth and nutrients (N, P, K, Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu) uptake of maize (Zea mays L.) in calcareous soil. Treatment effects on soil chemical and biological properties and the Cd and Pb availability to maize plants were also investigated. Applying PG decreased soil pH.

28073163	10.1002/bip.23006	Hydrocarbon-stapled lipopeptides exhibit selective antimicrobial activity.	Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) occur widely in nature and have been studied for their therapeutic potential. AMPs are of interest due to the large number of possible chemical structural combinations using natural and unnatural amino acids, with varying effects on their biological activities. Using physicochemical properties from known naturally occurring amphipathic cationic AMPs, several hydrocarbon-stapled lipopeptides (HSLPs) were designed, synthesized, and tested for antimicrobial properties. Peptides were chemically modified by N-terminal acylation, C-terminal amidation, and some were hydrocarbon stapled by intramolecular olefin metathesis. The effects of peptide length, amphipathic character, and stapling on antimicrobial activity were tested against Escherichia coli, three species of Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus megaterium, and Enterococcus faecalis), and two strains of Candida albicans.

A genome-scale metabolic network model (GEM) is a mathematical representation of an organism's metabolism. Today, GEMs are popular tools for computationally simulating the biotechnological processes and for predicting biochemical properties of (engineered) strains. In the present study, we have evaluated the predictive power of two GEMs, namely iBsu1103 (for Bacillus subtilis 168) and iMZ1055 (for Bacillus megaterium WSH002). For comparing the predictive power of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium GEMs, experimental data were obtained from previous wet-lab studies included in PubMed. By using these data, we set the environmental, stoichiometric and thermodynamic constraints on the models, and FBA is performed to predict the biomass production rate, and the values of other fluxes. For simulating experimental conditions in this study, COBRA toolbox was used. By using the wealth of data in the literature, we evaluated the accuracy of in silico simulations of these GEMs. Our results	2022	4	10	Iran J Biotechnol	Iranian journal of biotechnology	Bacillus Species; Biochemical capability; Computational biotechnology; Model validation; Systems biology	Ghasemi-Kahrizsangi	Tahereh

The implementation of sustainable agriculture encompasses practices enhancing the activity of beneficial soil microorganisms, able to modulate biogeochemical soil cycles and to affect soil fertility. Among them, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) establish symbioses with the roots of most food crops and play a key role in nutrient uptake and plant protection from biotic and abiotic stresses. Such beneficial services, encompassing improved crop performances, and soil resources availability, are the outcome of the synergistic action of AMF and the vast communities of mycorrhizospheric bacteria living strictly associated with their mycelium and spores, most of which showing plant growth promoting (PGP) activities, such as the ability to solubilize phosphate and produce siderophores and indole acetic acid (IAA).

Volatile organic compounds (VOC) produced by microorganisms in response to chemical stressor showed recently increasing attention, because of possible environmental applications. In this work, we aimed to bring the first proof of concept that volatolomic (i.e., VOCs analysis) can be used to determine candidate VOC markers of two soil bacteria strains (Pseudomonas fluorescens SG-1 and Bacillus megaterium Mes11) exposure to pesticides. VOC determination was based on solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Accordingly, we highlighted a set of bacterial VOCs modulated in each strains according to the nature of the pesticide used. Three out these VOCs were specifically modulated in P. fluorescens SG-1 when exposed with two pyrethroid pesticides (deltamethrine and cypermethrine): 2-hexanone; 1,3-ditertbutylbenzene and malonic acid, hexyl 3-methylbutyl ester.

Both proteins were expressed in and purified from Bacillus megaterium. Point mutations were made in the GT (W102A, D288N) and CPD (C698) of TcdB to ensure that Tcd169 and Tcd169FI were atoxic. Immunization with Tcd169 or Tcd169Fl induced protective immunity against TcdA/TcdB challenge through intraperitoneal injection, also provided mice full protection against infection with a hyper-virulent C. difficile strain (BI/NAP1/	2019	9	30	Front Immunol	Frontiers in immunology	Clostridium difficile infection; Salmonella typhimurium flagellin; chimeric protein; immunization; vaccine; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Toxins; Bacterial Vaccines; Cell Line; Clostridioides difficile; Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous; Female; Flagellin; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Vaccination; Vaccines, Synthetic	Wang	Shaohui

Microbial solubilization applies the natural ability of a microorganism to liberate phosphorus from unavailable structures. The main mechanism recognized to be responsible for the solubilization of phosphorus is the production of different types of organic acids. Three kinds of Bacillus species and three types of raw materials (poultry bones, fish bones, and ash) were tested for solubilization. The following parameters were compared for all discussed cases: pH, specific growth rate, solubilization factor, released phosphorus concentration, and total and individual concentration of organic acids. Utilization of ash brought about the highest specific and maximum specific growth rates. A decrease in pH was observed in most of the discussed cases with the exception of fish bones. At the same time, fish bones had the highest concentration of released P...O... and the highest total concentration of produced organic acids (gluconic, lactic, acetic, succinic, and propionic) in all discu	2019	2	4	Molecules	Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)	Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; microbial solubilization; organic acids; solubilization factor; Bacillus; Bacillus cereus; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Phosphorus; Solubility	Saeid	Agnieszka

Bacilli are commonly used as plant growth-promoting agents but can be limited in effectiveness to certain crop and soil environments. The objectives of this study were to (1) identify Bacillus strains that can be consistent in promoting the growth of corn, wheat, and soybean and (2) determine whether physiological traits expressed in vitro can be predictive of growth promotion efficacy/consistency and be used for selecting effective strains. Twelve Bacillus strains isolated from wheat rhizospheres were evaluated in greenhouse pot tests with nonsterile soil for their effects on the growth of corn, soybean, and wheat. The strains also were assessed in vitro for multiple physiological traits. All 12 strains increased corn growth significantly compared to the controls.

A novel inducible gene expression system using p-isopropyl benzoate (cumate) as an inducer was developed for the industrial production hosts, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium. Cumate is non-toxic to the host, inexpensive, and carbon source-independent inducer which provides an economical option for large-scale production of valuable proteins and chemicals from Bacillus strains. The synthetic cumate-inducible system was constructed by combining the strong constitutive Bacillus promoter Pveg with regulatory elements of the Pseudomonas putida, CymR repressor, and its operator sequence CuO. The designed expression cassette containing a sfGFP reporter under the cumate-inducible promoter was assembled into a Bacillus-E. coli shuttle and gene expression investigated in the two Bacillus strains.

The current study describes biological changes in Bacillus megaterium A14K cells growing in the presence of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), the most potent congener of dioxins. The results indicate that the metabolizing of 2,3,7,8-TCDD by BmA14K was accompanied with a novel morphological and biophysical profile typified by the growth of single cells with high levels of biosurfactant production, surface hydrophobicity and cell membrane permeability. Moreover, the TCDD-grown bacteria exhibited a specific fatty acid profile characterized by low ratios of branched/straight chain fatty acids (BCFAs/SCFAs) and saturated/unsaturated fatty acids (SFAs/USFAs) with a specific "signature" due to the presence of branched chain unsaturated fatty acids (BCUFAs).

RNA-seq analysis of B. megaterium exposed to pH 7.0 and pH 4.5 showed differential expression of 207 genes related to several processes. Among the 207 genes, 11 genes displayed increased transcription exclusively in pH 4.5. Exposure to pH 4.5 induced the expression of genes related to maintenance of cell integrity, pH homeostasis, alternative energy generation and modification of metabolic processes. Metabolic processes like pentose phosphate pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism and synthesis of arginine and proline were remodeled during acid stress. Genes associated with oxidative stress and osmotic stress were up-regulated at pH 4.5 indicating a link between acid stress and other stresses. Acid stress also induced expression of genes that encoded general stress-responsive proteins as well as several hypothetical proteins. Our study indicates that a network of genes aid B. megaterium G18..to adapt and survive in acid stress condition.	2019	11	25	Sci Rep	Scientific reports	Acids; Adaptation, Physiological; Bacillus megaterium; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genome, Bacterial; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Stress, Physiological; Transcriptome	Goswami	Gunajit

Crustins play important roles in defending against bacteria in the innate immunity system of crustaceans. In present study, we identified a crustin gene in Scylla paramamosain, which was named as SpCrus6. The ORF of SpCrus6 possessed a signal peptide sequence (SPS) at the N-terminus and a WAP domain at the C-terminus. And there were 5 Proline residues, 5 Glycine and 4 Cysteine residues between SPS and WAP domain in SpCrus6. These features indicated that SpCrus6 was a new member of crustin family. The SpCrus6 mRNA transcripts were up-regulated obviously after bacteria or virus challenge. These changes showed that SpCrus6 was involved in the antimicrobial and antiviral responses of Scylla paramamosain. Recombinant SpCrus6 (rSpCrus6) showed strong inhibitory abilities against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis).

The regulatory gene (aflR) encodes AflR, a positive regulator of transcriptional pathway that activates aflatoxin biosynthesis. It has been demonstrated in our laboratory that L-Asp-L-Asn (DN) extracted from Bacillus megaterium inhibited the growth of Aspergillus flavus. We fused gene encoding DN with the gene encoding specific dinuclear zinc finger cluster protein of AflR, then fusion protein competed with the AflS-AflR complex for the AflR binding site and significantly improved anti-A. flavus activity (growth of A. flavus and biosynthesis of aflatoxin B1) of DN.

Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is an attractive substitute for conventional organic solvents due to its unique transport and thermodynamic properties, its renewability and labile nature, and its high solubility for compounds such as alcohols, ketones, and aldehydes. However, biological systems that use scCO2 are mainly limited to in vitro processes due to its strong inhibition of cell viability and growth. To solve this problem, we used a bioprospecting approach to isolate a microbial strain with the natural ability to grow while exposed to scCO2. Enrichment culture and serial passaging of deep subsurface fluids from the McElmo Dome scCO2 reservoir in aqueous media under scCO2 headspace enabled the isolation of spore-forming strain Bacillus megaterium SR7.

Biofertilizers are the eco-friendly bio-input being used to sustain the agriculture by reducing the chemical inputs and improving the soil health. Quality is the major concern of biofertilizer technology which often leads to poor performance in the field and thereby loses the farmers' faith. To authenticate the strain as well as its presumed cell load of a commercial product, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers were developed for three biofertilizer strains viz., Azospirillum brasilense (Sp7), Bacillus megaterium (Pb1) and Azotobacter chroococcum (Ac1). We evaluated the feasibility of multiplex-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR for SCAR marker-based quality assessment of the product as well as the persistence of the strains during crop growth. We showed that multiplex PCR can concurrently discriminate the strains based on the amplicons' size and detects up to 10<sup>4</sup> cells per g or per ml of carrier-based or liquid formulation of biofertilizer, respectively. 	2019	1	16	J Basic Microbiol	Journal of basic microbiology	PGPR; SCAR marker; inoculants; multiplex PCR; quality standards; Agriculture; Azospirillum brasilense; Azotobacter; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Sequence; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA Primers; DNA, Bacterial; Fertilizers; Genetic Markers; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Plant Roots; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rhizosphere; Sensitivity and Specificity; Soil Microbiology; Zea mays	Reddypriya	Pasupuleti

Natural redox partners of bacterial cytochrome P450s (P450s) are mostly unknown. Therefore, substrate conversions are performed with heterologous redox partners; in the case of CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368, bovine adrenodoxin (Adx) and adrenodoxin reductase (AdR). Our aim was to optimize the redox system for CYP106A2 for improved product formation by testing 11 different combinations of redox partners. We found that electron transfer protein 1(516-618) showed the highest yield of the main product, 15..-hydroxyprogesterone, and, furthermore, produced a reduced amount of unwanted polyhydroxylated side products. Molecular protein-protein docking indicated that this is caused by subtle structural changes leading to alternative binding modes of both redox enzymes. Stopped-flow measurements analyzing the CYP106A2 reduction and showing substantial differences in the apparent rate constants supported this conclusion.

As the resolution for a given microscope cannot be easily enhanced, we present protocols to transform the small rod-shaped gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and gram-positive Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium) into larger, easily imaged spherical forms called spheroplasts or protoplasts. This transformation allows observers to rapidly and clearly determine whether peptides lodge themselves into the bacterial membrane (i.e., membrane localizing) or cross the membrane to enter the cell (i.e., translocating). With this approach, we also present a systematic method to characterize peptides as membrane localizing or translocating. While this method can be used for a variety of membrane-active peptides and bacterial strains, we demonstrate the utility of this protocol by observing the interaction of Bufori	2018	10	9	J Vis Exp	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	Microscopy, Confocal; Peptides; Protoplasts; Spheroplasts	Figueroa	Dania M

The development of new multifunctional materials integrating catalytically active and selective biomolecules, such as enzymes, as well as easily removable and robust inorganic supports that allow their use and reuse, is a subject of ongoing attention. In this work, the nitroreductase NfrA2/YncD (NR) from Bacillus megaterium Mes11 strain was successfully immobilized by adsorption and coprecipitation on layered double hydroxide (LDH) materials with different compositions (MgAl-LDH and ZnAl-LDH), particle sizes and morphologies, and using different enzyme/LDH mass ratios (Q). The materials were characterized and the immobilization and catalytic performance of the biohybrids were studied and optimized. The nitroreductase-immobilized on the nanosized MgAl-LDH displayed the best catalytic performance with 42-46% of catalytic retention and&gt;80% of immobilization yield at saturation values of enzyme loading Cs.........0.6...g NR/g LDH (Q...=...0.8).

The linker region of multi-domain enzymes has a very important role for the interconnection of different enzyme modules and for the efficiency of catalytic activity. This is particularly evident for artificial chimeric systems. We characterised an artificial self-sufficient enzyme developed by genetic fusion of the catalytic domain of cytochrome P450 3A4 and reductase domain of Bacillus megaterium BM3 (BMR). Here we report the direct electrochemistry of 3A4-BMR chimeras immobilised on glassy carbon electrodes and we investigated the effect of inter-domain loop length and immobilising environment flexibility on both redox properties and electrocatalysis. We observe that redox potential can be modulated by the linker length and the immobilising layer flexibility. In addition, enzyme inter-domain dynamics and environment flexibility also modulate 3A4-BMR turnover efficiency on electrode system.

30097448	10.1128/AEM.01734-18	Orthologues of Bacillus subtilis Spore Crust Proteins Have a Structural Role in the Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 Spore Exosporium.	The exosporium of Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spores is morphologically distinct from exosporia observed for the spores of many other species. Previous work has demonstrated that unidentified genes carried on one of the large indigenous plasmids are required for the assembly of the Bacillus megaterium exosporium. Here, we provide evidence that pBM600-encoded orthologues of the Bacillus subtilis CotW and CotX proteins, which form the crust layer in spores of that species, are structural components of the Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spore exosporium. The introduction of plasmid-borne cotW and orthologous cotX genes to the PV361 strain, which lacks all indigenous plasmids and produces spores that are devoid of an exosporium, results in the development of spores with a rudimentary exosporium-type structure. Additionally, purified recombinant CotW protein is shown to assemble at the air-water interface to form thin sheets of material, which is con	2019	10	4	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacillus; spore coat; Bacillus megaterium; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Mutation; Plasmids; Spores, Bacterial	Manetsberger	Julia
30055324	10.1016/j.ymben.2018.07.017	Characterization and engineering of a carotenoid biosynthesis operon from Bacillus megaterium.	Bacillus megaterium belongs to the group of pigmented bacilli producing carotenoids that ensure self-protection from UV radiation-induced and collateral oxidative damage. Metabolite profiling of strain MS941 revealed the presence of the C30 carotenoids 4,4'-diapophytofluene and 4,4'-diaponeurosporenic acid. A gene function analysis demonstrated the presence of a corresponding C30 carotenoid biosynthetic pathway with pharmaceutical importance. We identified a gene cluster comprising putative genes for a farnesyl diphosphate synthase (IspA), a diapophytoene synthase (CrtM) and three distinct diapophytoene desaturases (CrtN1-3). Intriguingly, crtM was organized in an operon together with two of the identified crtN genes. The individual activities of the encoded enzymes were determined by heterologous expression and product analysis in the non-carotenogenic model organism Escherichia coli.

30036448	10.1002/bit.26802	A tailor-made, self-sufficient and recyclable monooxygenase catalyst based on coimmobilized cytochrome P450 BM3 and glucose dehydrogenase.	Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) promote hydroxylations in a broad variety of substrates. Their prowess in C-H bond functionalization renders P450s promising catalysts for organic synthesis. However, operating P450 reactions involve complex management of the main substrates, O2 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) reducing equivalents against an overall background of low operational stability. Whole-cell biocatalysis, although often used, offers no general solution to these problems. Herein, we present the design of a tailor-made, self-sufficient, operationally stabilized and recyclable P450 catalyst on porous solid support. Using enzymes as fusion proteins with the polycationic binding module Zbasic2 , the P450s BM3 (from Bacillus megaterium) was coimmobilized with glucose dehydrogenase (type IV; from B. megaterium) on anionic sulfopropyl-activated carrier (ReliSorb SP).

This allows a proposal of species-specific epidemiological cutoff values (ECOFFs) for the interpretation of antimicrobial resistance in these species. MICs determined by the modified CLSI method were 2- to 16-fold higher than with the CLSI-recommended method for several antimicrobials.

Although CB118 and perfluoroalkyl acids are present in all humans and biota, effects in the metabolic fate of CB118 leading to toxicity change are unclear. P450BM3, which is isolated from the soil bacterium Bacillus megaterium, metabolized CB118 to three different hydroxylated pentachlorobiphenyls (M1-M3). M2 was identified as 4'-OH-2,3',4,5,5'-pentachlorobiphenyl. These reactions were promoted by the presence of PFCAs, and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFCA-C8) was the most effective for accelerating these reactions among PFCAs with different carbon chain length. The production rate of M2 was accelerated by 25-times using PFCA-C8.

Here we present for the first time the site-selective chemical modification of exposed tyrosine residues in SacB, a levansucrase from Bacillus megaterium (Bm-LS) for enzyme engineering purposes via an ene-type reaction. Bm-LS is unable to sustain the synthesis of high molecular weight (HMW) levan (a fructose polymer) due to protein-oligosaccharide dissociation events occurring at an early stage during polymer elongation. We switched the catalyst from levan-like oligosaccharide synthesis to the efficient production of a HMW fructan polymer through the covalent addition of a flexible chemical side-chain that fluctuates over the central binding cavity of the enzyme preventing premature oligosaccharide disengagement.	2020	10	1	Chem Sci	Chemical science	NA	Ortiz-Soto	Maria Elena

Bacterial spores displaying heterologous proteins have been proposed as a safe and efficient method for delivery of antigens and enzymes to animal mucosal surfaces. Initial studies have been performed using Bacillus subtilis spores, but other spore forming organisms have also been considered. B. megaterium spores have been shown capable of displaying large amounts of a model heterologous protein (Discosoma red fluorescent protein mRFP) that in part crossed the exosporium to localize in the space between the outer coat layer and the exosporium. Here, B. megaterium spores have been used to adsorb Bcp1 (bacterioferritin comigratory protein 1), a peroxiredoxin of the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus, known to have an antioxidant activity.

29778095	10.1186/s12934-018-0932-9	Establishing an innovative carbohydrate metabolic pathway for efficient production of 2-keto-L-gulonic acid in Ketogulonicigenium robustum initiated by intronic promoters.	2-Keto-L-gulonic acid (2-KGA), the precursor of vitamin C, is currently produced by two-step fermentation. In the second step, L-sorbose is transformed into 2-KGA by the symbiosis system composed of Ketogulonicigenium vulgare and Bacillus megaterium. Due to the different nutrient requirements and the uncertain ratio of the two strains, the symbiosis system significantly limits strain improvement and fermentation optimization. In this study, Ketogulonicigenium robustum SPU_B003 was reported for its capability to grow well independently and to produce more 2-KGA than that of K. vulgare in a mono-culture system. The complete genome of K. robustum SPU_B003 was sequenced, and the metabolic characteristics were analyzed. Compared to the four reported K. vulgare genomes, K. robustum SPU_B003 contained more tRNAs, rRNAs, NAD and NADP biosynthetic genes, as well as regulation- and cell signaling-related genes. Moreover, the amino acid biosynthesis pathways were more complete.

Three novel mixed ligand metal complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of Zn(II), Sn(II), and Ce(III) with gemifloxacin (GMFX) in the presence of glycine (Gly) (1:1:1 molar ratio). The coordination possibility of the two ligands toward metal ions has been proposed in the light of elemental analysis, molar conductance, spectral infrared (IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and proton-nuclear magnetic resonance (..H NMR), and magnetic studies. Results suggest that GMFX and Gly interact with the metal ions as bidentate ligands. Electronic and magnetic data proposed the octahedral structure for all complexes under investigation.

Zinc oxide is an essential ingredient of many enzymes, sun screens, and ointments for pain and itch relief. Its microcrystals are very efficient light absorbers in the UVA and UVB region of spectra due to wide bandgap. Impact of zinc oxide on biological functions depends on its morphology, particle size, exposure time, concentration, pH, and biocompatibility. They are more effective against microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas vulgaris, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Mechanism of action has been ascribed to the activation of zinc oxide nanoparticles by light, which penetrate the bacterial cell wall via diffusion. It has been confirmed from SEM and TEM images of the bacterial cells that zinc oxide nanoparticles disintegrate the cell membrane and accumulate in the cytoplasm where they interact with biomolecules causing cell apoptosis leadin	2022	3	21	Nanoscale Res Lett	Nanoscale research letters	Antimicrobial; Biodistribution; Mechanism; Microorganisms; Toxicity; Zinc oxide nanoparticles	Siddiqi	Khwaja Salahuddin

Bacillus sp. strains as attractive hosts for the production of heterologous secretory proteins usually play important roles in bio-industry. However, low transformation efficiency of exogenous plasmids limited the application of Bacillus species. Here, a novel plasmid interspecific transfer system, with high transformation efficiency, high positive rate, and convenient manipulation, has been successfully constructed. A high electrotransformation efficiency strain Bacillus subtilis F-168 containing the counter-selectable marker mazF was used as the plasmid donor strain in this transfer method. A shuttled plasmid pBE980 and its recombinant plasmids pBE980::pulA and pBE980::HSPA were successfully transferred into the recipient Bacillus strains (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 66, Bacillus licheniformis 124 and Bacillus megaterium 258) by this method.

With the threat of the growing number of bacteria resistant to antibiotics, the re-emergence of previously deadly infections and the emergence of new infections, there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic agent. Silver in the nano form, which is being used increasingly as antibacterial agents, may extend its antibacterial application to emerging and re-emerging multidrug-resistant pathogens, the main cause of nosocomial diseases worldwide. In the present study, a completely bottom up method to prepare green nano-silver was used. To explore the action of nano-silver on emerging Bacillus megaterium MTCC 7192 and re-emerging Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741 pathogenic bacteria, the study includes an analysis of the bacterial membrane damage through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) as well as alternation of zeta potential and intracellular leakages.

The prediction of chemical mixture toxicity is a major concern regarding unintentional mixture of pesticides from agricultural lands treated with various such compounds. We focused our work on a mixture of three herbicides commonly applied on maize crops within a fortnight, namely mesotrione (..-triketone), nicosulfuron (sulfonylurea) and S-metolachlor (chloroacetanilide). The metabolic pathways of mesotrione and nicosulfuron were qualitatively and quantitatively determined with a bacterial strain (Bacillus megaterium Mes11). This strain was isolated from an agricultural soil and able to biotransform both these herbicides. Although these pathways were unaffected in the case of binary or ternary herbicide mixtures, kinetics of nicosulfuron disappearance and also of mesotrione and nicosulfuron metabolite formation was strongly modulated. The toxicity of the parent compounds and metabolites was evaluated for individual compounds and mixtures with the standardized Microtox.. test.

29694403	10.1371/journal.pone.0196166	Bacillus megaterium strains derived from water and soil exhibit differential responses to the herbicide mesotrione.	The intense use of herbicides for weed control in agriculture causes selection pressure on soil microbiota and water ecosystems, possibly resulting in changes to microbial processes, such as biogeochemical cycles. These xenobiotics may increase the production of reactive oxygen species and consequently affect the survival of microorganisms, which need to develop strategies to adapt to these conditions and maintain their ecological functionality. This study analyzed the adaptive responses of bacterial isolates belonging to the same species, originating from two different environments (water and soil), and subjected to selection pressure by herbicides. The effects of herbicide Callisto and its active ingredient, mesotrione, induced different adaptation strategies on the cellular, enzymatic, and structural systems of two Bacillus megaterium isolates obtained from these environments.

Native cell-free transcription-translation systems offer a rapid route to characterize the regulatory elements (promoters, transcription factors) for gene expression from nonmodel microbial hosts, which can be difficult to assess through traditional in vivo approaches. One such host, Bacillus megaterium, is a giant Gram-positive bacterium with potential biotechnology applications, although many of its regulatory elements remain uncharacterized. Here, we have developed a rapid automated platform for measuring and modeling in vitro cell-free reactions and have applied this to B. megaterium to quantify a range of ribosome binding site variants and previously uncharacterized endogenous constitutive and inducible promoters. To provide quantitative models for cell-free systems, we have also applied a Bayesian approach to infer ordinary differential equation model parameters by simultaneously using time-course data from multiple experimental conditions.

The amoebic protozoon Dictyostelium discoideum has been a model organism in cell biology for decades and has recently also been used for research on host-pathogen interactions and the evolution of innate immunity. In the genome of D. discoideum, genes can be identified that potentially allow the synthesis of a variety of antimicrobial proteins. However, at the protein level only very few antimicrobial proteins have been characterized that may interact directly with bacteria and help in fighting infection of D. discoideum with potential pathogens.

The inhibition of tyrosinase (Ty, EC 1.14.18.1) represents an efficient strategy of decreasing melanogenesis and skin hyperpigmentation. A combination of crystallographic and docking studies on two different tyrosinases, that from Bacillus megaterium (TyBm) and that from a mushroom (TyM), has contributed to increasing our knowledge about their structural information and translating that information to the most druggable human Ty (TyH) isozyme. In particular, we designed and synthesized a series of 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperazine and 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidine derivatives showing inhibitory activities on TyM at micromolar ranges and more potency than that of the reference compound, kojic acid. The crystal structures of TyBm with inhibitor 3 (IC50 value of 25.11 ..M) and 16 (IC50 value of 5.25 ..M) were solved, confirming the binding poses hypothesized by in silico studies and revealing the main molecular determinants for the binding recognition of the inhibitors.	2019	5	28	J Med Chem	Journal of medicinal chemistry	Agaricus; Catalytic Domain; Enzyme Inhibitors; Kinetics; Molecular Docking Simulation; Monophenol Monooxygenase; Piperazines; Structure-Activity Relationship	Ferro	Stefania

Our long-timescale MD simulations identify key conformational states not previously observed by means of X-ray crystallography and short MD simulations that present the loop containing one of the catalytic residues, Asp239, in a wide-open conformation, which is likely involved in the binding of the epoxide substrate.

Reductive dehalogenases are corrinoid and iron-sulfur cluster-dependent enzymes that mostly act as the terminal oxidoreductases in the bacterial organohalide respiration process. This process often leads to detoxification of recalcitrant organohalide pollutants. While low cell yields and oxygen sensitivity hamper the study of many reductive dehalogenases, this is not the case for the nonrespiratory reductive dehalogenase NpRdhA from Nitratireductor pacificus. We here report in vitro and in vivo reconstitution of an NADPH-dependent reducing system for NpRdhA. Surprisingly, NpRdhA mediated organohalide reduction could not be supported using N. pacificus ferredoxin-NAD(P)H oxidoreductase and associated ferredoxins. Instead, we found a nonphysiological system comprised of the Escherichia coli flavodoxin reductase (EcFldr) in combination with spinach ferredoxin (SpFd) was able to support NADPH-dependent organohalide reduction by NpRdhA.

The ability to solubilize fixed inorganic phosphorus (P) for plant growth is important for increasing crop yield. More P can be released by inoculating soil with inorganic-phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (iPSBs).

We simultaneously obtained 76 iPSB isolates from 576 wells containing two agricultural soils. This method conveniently identified positive iPSB strains and effectively prevented fungal cross-contamination. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of the isolated strains showed that Bacillus megaterium was the most dominant iPSB, and strains Y99, Y95, Y924 and Y1412 were selected as representatives for the analysis of P solubilization.

29363941	10.1021/acschembio.7b00846	Heterologous Production and Purification of a Functional Chloroform Reductive Dehalogenase.	Reductive dehalogenases (RDases) are key enzymes involved in the respiratory process of anaerobic organohalide respiring bacteria (ORB). Heterologous expression of respiratory RDases is desirable for structural and functional studies; however, there are few reports of successful expression of these enzymes. Dehalobacter sp. strain UNSWDHB is an ORB, whose preferred electron acceptor is chloroform. This study describes efforts to express recombinant reductive dehalogenase (TmrA), derived from UNSW DHB, using the heterologous hosts Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. Here, we report the recombinant expression of soluble and functional TmrA, using B. megaterium as an expression host under a xylose-inducible promoter. Successful incorporation of iron-sulfur clusters and a corrinoid cofactor was demonstrated using UV-vis spectroscopic analyses. In vitro dehalogenation of chloroform using purified recombinant TmrA was demonstrated.

Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Bacillus spp. from polluted freshwater has been poorly addressed. The objective of this research was to determine the diversity and enzymatic potentialities of Bacillus spp. strains isolated from the Almendares River. Bacilli strains from a polluted river were characterized by considering the production of extracellular enzymes using API ZYM. 14 strains were selected and identified using 16S rRNA, gyrB and aroE genes. Genotypic diversity of the Bacillus spp. strains was evaluated using pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the presence of genetic determinants of potential virulence toxins of the Bacillus cereus group and proteinaceous crystal inclusions of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined. 10 strains were identified as B. thuringiensis, two as Bacillus megaterium, one as Bacillus pumilus and one as Bacillus subtilis.

The present attempt was made to study the role of exogenously applied salicylic acid (SA) and putrescine (Put) on the phytoremediation of heavy metals and on the growth parameters of chickpea grown in sandy soil. The SA and Put were applied alone as well as in combination with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The PGPRs, isolated from the rhizosphere of chickpea, were characterized on the basis of colony morphology and biochemical traits through gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and identified by 16S-rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus megaterium. The chickpea seeds were soaked in 24..h old fresh cultures of isolates for 2-3..h prior to sowing. The growth regulators (PGRs), SA and Put (150..mg/L), were applied to the seedlings as foliar spray at three-leaf stage.

Here, we present a genome-scale metabolic model for B. megaterium DSM319, iJA1121, which is a result of a metabolic network reconciliation process. The model includes 1709 reactions, 1349 metabolites, and 1121 genes. Based on multiple-genome alignments and available genome-scale metabolic models for other Bacillus species, we constructed a draft network using an automated approach followed by manual curation. The refinements were performed using a gap-filling process. Constraint-based modeling was used to scrutinize network features. Phenotyping assays were performed in order to validate the growth behavior of the model using different substrates.

Hybrid Pennisetum (Pennisetum americanum........P. purpureum Schumach L.) is a tall and rapidly growing perennial C4 bunch grass. It has been considered as a promising plant for phytoremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil due to its high biomass, high resistance to environmental stress, pests and diseases. Heavy metal bioavailability level is the most important parameter for measurement of the phytoremediation efficiency. Endophytic bacteria were used to further enhance phytoremediation of heavy metals through bioaccumulation or bioabsorption process. In the present study, the endophytic Bacillus megaterium strain 'BM18' isolated from hybrid Pennisetum was screened under 10-70.....M cadmium (Cd) stress for Cd-resistant mutant colonies. And one such mutant colony'BM18-2' was obtained from the screen. Comparably, 'BM18-2' was more Cd-tolerant and had higher Cd removal ability than the original strain'BM18'.

The strains CM-Z19 and CM-Z6, which are capable of highly degrading chlorpyrifos-methyl, were isolated from soil. They were identified as Bacillus megaterium CM-Z19 and Pseudomonas syringae CM-Z6, respectively, based on the 16S rRNA and an analysis of their morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. The strain CM-Z19 showed 92.6% degradation of chlorpyrifos-methyl (100 mg/L) within 5 days of incubation, and the strain CM-Z6 was 99.1% under the same conditions. In addition, the degradation characteristics of the two strains were compared and studied, and the results showed that the strain CM-Z19 had higher phosphoesterase activity and ability to degrade the organophosphorus pesticide than did the strain CM-Z6. However, the strain CM-Z19 could not degrade its first hydrolysis metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) and could not completely degrade chlorpyrifos-methyl.

Composting process of residual organic material generates considerable amounts of liquid leachate which contains high organic load. This waste stream can be considered as potential nutrient source to support microbial growth. In the present work, the utilization of compost leachate as fermentation substrate for Bacillus species production was studied. The physicochemical properties of the leachate and two co-substrates (residual yeast and whey permeate) were determined. The characterization of leachate showed that it is a potential source of carbon, but its nitrogen content may limit the bacterial growth. In order to determine a good recipe of culture medium for fermentation of individual strains of Bacillus species, leachate was added with yeast and whey permeate. Raw and diluted leachates with and without amendments were tested in shake-flask fermentation assays. Results showed that Bacillus sp. grew better in diluted leachate than in raw leachate.

Peritassa campestris (Celastraceae) root bark accumulates potent antitumor quinonemethide triterpenes (QMTs). When grown in their natural habitat, plants of the family Celastraceae produce different QMTs such as celastrol (3) and pristimerin (4). However, when they are inserted in in vitro culture systems, they accumulate maytenin (1) as the main compound. Recently, Bacillus megaterium was detected as an endophytic microorganism (EM) living inside P. campestris roots cultured in vitro. We hypothesized that compound (1) controls EM growth more efficiently, and that the presence of EMs in the root culture causes compound (1) to accumulate. For the first time, this work has explored plant-microorganism interaction in a species of the family Celastraceae by co-culture with an EM. Live endophytic bacteria were used, and QMT accumulation in P. campestris adventitious roots was our main focus. The antimicrobial activity of the main QMTs against endophytic B. megaterium was also evaluated.

31338767	10.1007/s11356-019-05939-9	Role of plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial consortium in improving the Vigna radiata growth and alleviation of aluminum and drought stresses.	Aluminum (Al) is a major constraint for plant growth by inducing inhibition of root elongation in acid soils around the world. Besides, drought is another major abiotic stress that adversely affects growth and productivity of agricultural crops. The plant growth-promoting (PGP) rhizobacterial strains are useful choice to decrease these stressful effects and is now extensively in practice. However, the use of bacterial inoculation has not been attempted for the mitigation of Al stress in plants growing at high Al levels under drought stress. Therefore, in the present study, Al- and drought-tolerant bacterial strains were isolated from Lactuca sativa and Beta vulgaris rhizospheric soils. Among the bacterial isolates, two strains, CAM12 and CAH6, were selected based on their ability to tolerate high levels of Al (8 mM) and drought (15% PEG-6000, w/v) stresses.

31336266	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.120906	Optimization for silver remediation from aqueous solution by novel bacterial isolates using response surface methodology: Recovery and characterization of biogenic AgNPs.	Silver is a toxic but precious heavy metal that has been implemented in diverse biomedical and environmental sectors. Extensive use of this metal has provoked severe environmental concerns. Hence there is an increasing demand for the development of a simple, inexpensive and eco-friendly approach for the remediation and recovery of silver. In this study, novel bacterial strains Enterobacter cloacae SMP1, Cupriavidus necator SMP2, and Bacillus megaterium SMP3 were isolated from silver mining site for the sake of silver remediation. Various experimental factors including temperature, pH and inoculum size (I_S) were optimized for silver remediation by SMP1 using central composite design (CCD) based on response surface methodology (RSM). For maximum 100% removal of silver the optimized values of temperature, pH and I_S were 23.5.....C, 7.5 and 2% (v/v) respectively in less than 10...h of incubation.

Directed evolution methodologies have been used as promising strategies for improving the catalytic properties of many existing enzymes. In the presented work, this approach was applied to improve the enzyme activity of l-asparaginase I obtained from Bacillus megaterium H-1. After two rounds of error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) and two generations of sequential DNA shuffling, all of 5 different mutants showed a significant increase in the enzyme activity of l-asparaginase I, ranging from 6.27 to 22.78 IU/mL. Among these mutants, D-9B and DD-12G displayed the relatively high catalytic activity, which were 20.22-fold and 21.33-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme (WT), respectively. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of D-9B and DD-12G were also improved, which were 132.73 min<sup>-1</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup> and 146.39 min<sup>-1</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, in comparison to that of WT (3.39 min<sup>-1</sup>mM<sup>-1</sup>).

31305515	10.3791/59770	Enzymatic Synthesis of Epoxidized Metabolites of Docosahexaenoic, Eicosapentaenoic, and Arachidonic Acids.	The epoxidized metabolites of various polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), termed epoxy fatty acids, have a wide range of roles in human physiology. These metabolites are produced endogenously by the cytochrome P450 class of enzymes. Because of their diverse and potent biological effects, there is considerable interest in studying these metabolites. Determining the unique roles of these metabolites in the body is a difficult task, as the epoxy fatty acids must first be obtained in significant amounts and with high purity. Obtaining compounds from natural sources is often labor intensive, and soluble epoxide hydrolases (sEH) rapidly hydrolyze the metabolites. On the other hand, obtaining these metabolites via chemical reactions is very inefficient, due to the difficulty of obtaining pure regioisomers and enantiomers, low yields, and extensive (and expensive) purification.

31269194	10.1093/femsle/fnz146	Novel cortex lytic enzymes in Bacillus megaterium QM B1551 spores.	Present models for spore germination in Bacillus species include a requirement for either the SleB or CwlJ cortex lytic enzymes to efficiently depolymerise the spore cortex. Previous work has demonstrated that B. megaterium spores may differ to other species in this regard, since sleB cwlJ null mutant spores complemented with the gene in trans for the non-peptidoglycan lysin YpeB can efficiently degrade the cortex. Here, we identify two novel cortex lytic enzymes, encoded at the BMQ_2391 and BMQ_3234 loci, which are essential for cortex hydrolysis in the absence of SleB and CwlJ. Ellipsoid localisation microscopy places the BMQ_3234 protein within the inner-spore coat, a region of the spore that is populated by other cortex lytic enzymes. The findings reinforce the idea that there is a degree of variation in mechanisms of cortex hydrolysis across the Bacillales, raising potential implications for environmental decontamination strategies based upon targeted inactivation of components of	2020	6	15	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	 Bacillus ; cortex lytic enzyme; peptidoglycan lysin; spore germination; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Peptidoglycan; Spores, Bacterial	Riyami	Bahja Al

For this reason, adding urea to the medium and the domestication of Bacillus megaterium at low temperature were proposed to produce more calcium carbonate based on an analysis of growth characteristics, urease activity, and the production rates for calcium carbonate under different conditions. Sand solidification tests were conducted to demonstrate improvements caused by the methods. The results showed that the higher the temperature, the faster the growth of Bacillus megaterium and the stronger the urease activity. Growth was fastest and urease activity strongest at a pH of 8.

There are five sorbose/sorbosone dehydrogenases (SSDHs), SSDA1, SSDA1-P, SSDA2, SSDA3 and SSDB, and two sorbosone dehydrogenases (SNDHs), glucose/sorbosone dehydrogenase (GSNDH) and sorbosone dehydrogenase (SNDH), in K. vulgare, which could play crucial roles in transforming L-sorbose or L-sorbosone to 2-KLG. However, confusion about the catalytic characteristics of the individual SSDHs and SNDHs makes construction of a recombinational strain for the purpose of enhancing 2-KLG production difficult. In this study, the five SSDHs and two SNDHs from K. vulgare WSH-001 were purified, and their optimal pH values and reaction temperatures, kinetic properties, thermostabilities, substrate spectra	2019	12	9	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	2-Keto-L-gulonic acid; Enzymes; Gluconobacter oxydans; L-Ascorbic acid; Vitamin C; Ascorbic Acid; Bacterial Proteins; Carbohydrate Dehydrogenases; Enzyme Stability; Metabolic Engineering; Rhodobacteraceae; Sorbose; Sugar Acids	Wang	Panpan
31129399	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.143	Biodegradation of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide by a Bacillus megaterium strain SZK-5: Functional enzymes and antioxidant defense mechanism.	Hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) is the most widely used water-soluble linear polymer with high molecular weight in polymer flooding. Microbiological degradation is an environment-friendly and effective method of treating HPAM-containing oilfield produced water. In this study, a strain SZK-5 that could degrade HPAM was isolated from soil contaminated by oilfield produced water. Based on morphological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis, the strain was identified as Bacillus megaterium. The biodegradation capability of strain SZK-5 was determined by incubation in a mineral salt medium (MSM) containing HPAM under different environmental conditions, showing 55.93% of the HPAM removed after 7...d of incubation under the optimum conditions ((NH4)2SO4...=...1667.9...mg...L<sup>-1</sup>, temperature...=...24.05.....C and pH...=...8.19).

31118468	10.1038/s41598-019-44211-5	Exploring the sequence variability of polymerization-involved residues in the production of levan- and inulin-type fructooligosaccharides with a levansucrase.	The connection between the gut microbiome composition and human health has long been recognized, such that the host-microbiome interplay is at present the subject of the so-called "precision medicine". Non-digestible fructooligosaccharides (FOS) can modulate the microbial composition and therefore their consumption occupies a central place in a strategy seeking to reverse microbiome-linked diseases. We created a small library of Bacillus megaterium levansucrase variants with focus on the synthesis of levan- and inulin-type FOS. Modifications were introduced at positions R370, K373 and F419, which are either part of the oligosaccharide elongation pathway or are located in the vicinity of residues that modulate polymerization. These amino acids were exchanged by residues of different characteristics, some of them being extremely low- or non-represented in enzymes of the levansucrase family (Glycoside Hydrolase 68, GH68). F419 seemed to play a minor role in FOS binding.

31113879	10.1073/pnas.1903675116	Structural and functional analyses of the N-terminal domain of the A subunit of a <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> spore germinant receptor.	Germination of Bacillus spores is induced by the interaction of specific nutrient molecules with germinant receptors (GRs) localized in the spore's inner membrane. GRs typically consist of three subunits referred to as A, B, and C, although functions of individual subunits are not known. Here we present the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the A subunit of the Bacillus megaterium GerK3 GR, revealing two distinct globular subdomains bisected by a cleft, a fold with strong homology to substrate-binding proteins in bacterial ABC transporters. Molecular docking, chemical shift perturbation measurement, and mutagenesis coupled with spore germination analyses support a proposed model that the interface between the two subdomains in the NTD of GR A subunits serves as the germinant binding site and plays a critical role in spore germination. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding the germinant recruitment mechanism by which GRs	2020	3	23	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	Bacillus; spore germinant receptor; spore germination; spores; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Molecular Docking Simulation; Protein Domains; Protein Subunits; Spores, Bacterial	Li	Yunfeng

Coir pith glucose syrup beads were used as a supporter in a biofilter system. The modified coir pith beads provided a carbon source and controlled humidity for microorganism growth for long-term operation without external nutrient supplementation. For the screening, Bacillus spp. were immobilised on coir pith beads and used for benzene bioremediation. The result showed that coir pith beads immobilised with Bacillus megaterium can remove on average 85-100% of the benzene (215-day operation). In addition, B. megaterium presented the ability to transform benzene to catechol. For an up-scaled application, a 25-L biofilter system was developed and tested in a closed 24-m<sup>3</sup> container re-injected with 0.6...ppm benzene for 8 cycles. The system presented the ability to remove 100% of the benzene.

To determine the impact of the N-terminal nonessential domains on the enzymological properties of a pullulanase (BmP) from Bacillus megaterium strain P6. The domains of BmP were identified by the conserved domain (CD) search online software. BmP was prepared by fermentation with the strain P6 and its N-terminal truncated form (BmNTP) was obtained by heterologous expression. Structure-property relations were analyzed by homology modeling. BmP showed a domain architecture consisting of CBM41a-CBM41b-X-CBM48-pulA. CBM41a-CBM41b-X was removed in BmNTP. In comparison with BmP, BmNTP was lower in pH stability, specific activity and optimum NaCl concentration, but higher in Km value, thermostability, optimum pH and temperature, and activity enhancement by NaCl. Particularly, BmNTP was active over 0-35% (w/v) NaCl concentrations and enhanced 8.7 folds in specific activity (from 17.6 to 170..U/mg) in 10% NaCl.

30902716	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.03.118	Screening of chitin deacetylase producing microbes from marine source using a novel receptor on agar plate.	Chitosan is a deacetylated form of naturally occurring polymer; chitin. On an industrial scale, the deacetylation of chitin to chitosan is performed using harsh chemicals like sodium hydroxide. This not only adds to the environmental pollution but the product is also random in terms of its deacetylation. This shortcoming can be addressed by using enzymes like chitin deacetylase (CDA). The screening of these organisms would require a reliable, fast and sensitive screening method. The deacetylation of chitin into chitosan, releases acetate as the byproduct of the reaction. A receptor which specifically binds to the acetate ion was synthesized chemically. The receptor upon binding with the acetate ion emitted a fluorescence which could be viewed using the gel documentation unit. The receptor was optimized for the screening of CDA producing microbes with the positive fungal control as Penicillium sp. and bacterial control as Bacillus megaterium.

Two bacteria capable of efficiently degrading atrazine were isolated from soil, and named ATLJ-5 and ATLJ-11. ATLJ-5 and ATLJ-11 were identified as Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus megaterium, respectively. The degradation efficiency of atrazine (50 mg/L) by strain ATLJ-5 can reach about 98.6% after 7 days, and strain ATLJ-11 can reach 99.6% under the same conditions. The degradation of atrazine is faster when two strains are used in combination. Adding the proper amount of fresh soil during the degradation of atrazine by these two strains can also increase the degradation efficiency. The strains ATLJ-5 and ATLJ-11 have high tolerance to atrazine, and can tolerate at least 1000 mg/L of atrazine. In addition, the strains ATLJ-5 and ATLJ-11 have been successfully made into a microbial agent that can be used to treat atrazine residues in soil.

30875400	10.1371/journal.pone.0213797	Tunicate-associated bacteria show a great potential for the discovery of antimicrobial compounds.	Tunicates (Ascidians, sea squirts) are marine protochordates, which live sedentary or sessile in colonial or solitary forms. These invertebrates have to protect themselves against predators and invaders. A most successful strategy, to not being eaten by predators and prevent pathogenic microorganisms to settle, is the usage of chemical molecules for defence. To accomplish this, tunicates take advantage of the specialized metabolites produced by the bacteria associated with them. Therefore, the microbiome of the tunicates can be regarded as a promising bioresource for bacterial strains producing compounds with antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to test this hypothesis by (i) isolation of tunicate-associated bacteria, (ii) analysis of the antibacterial activities of these strains, and (iii) purification and structure elucidation of an active compound derived from this bioresource.

Bacteria that are capable of accumulating lipids in their cells as storage compounds can also produce polyhydroxyalkanoates of high technological value, depending on the specific culture conditions. The objective of this study was to utilize crude glycerol from biodiesel (CGB) as a substrate, which is a major byproduct from biodiesel production, to produce lipophilic compounds. Bacillus megaterium INCQS 425 was cultivated and evaluated for the production of lipophilic compounds and the properties of these compounds were investigated. Cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 0.60:1 favored the accumulation of lipids by (17.5%) comprising mainly palmitic acid (13.08%), palmitoleic (39.48%), and especially oleic acid (37.02%), which imparts good characteristics to biodiesel. Meanwhile, cultivation of the bacteria in a medium with a C:N ratio of 4:1 favored the accumulation of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) (3.31gL<sup>-1</sup>) mainly comprising medium and long chain PHA. 	2019	8	1	Int J Biol Macromol	International journal of biological macromolecules	Bacterial lipids; Crude glycerol; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Bacillus megaterium; Biofuels; Biotechnology; Fatty Acids; Glycerol; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Molecular Weight; Polyhydroxyalkanoates	de Jesus Assis	Denilson
30771444	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.01.018	Expanding the promoter toolbox of Bacillus megaterium.	Over the past decades, Bacillus megaterium has gained significant interest in the biotechnological industry due to its high capacity for protein production. Although many proteins have been expressed efficiently using the optimized xylose inducible system so far, there is a considerable demand for novel promoters with varying activities, particularly for the adjustment of protein levels in multi-enzyme cascades. Genome-wide microarray analyses of the industrially important B. megaterium strain MS941 were applied to identify constitutive and growth phase dependent promoters for the expression of heterologous proteins from the early exponential to the early stationary phase of bacterial growth. Fifteen putative promoter elements were selected based on differential gene expression profiles and signal intensities of the generated microarray data.

Induced by PGPR and PGRs.	The plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth regulators (PGRs) can be applied to improve the growth and productivity of plants, with potential to be used for genetic improvement of drought tolerance. However, for genetic improvement to be achieved, a solid understanding of the physiological and biochemical changes in plants induced by PGPR and PGR is required. The present study was carried out to investigate the role of PGPR and PGRs on the physiology and biochemical changes in chickpea grown under drought stress conditions and their association with drought tolerance. The PGPR, isolated from the rhizosphere of chickpea, were characterized on the basis of colony morphology and biochemical characters. They were also screened for the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ammonia (NH3), and exopolysaccharides (EPS) production. The isolated PGPR strains, named P1, P2, and P3, were identified by 16S-rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus 	2020	9	10	Sci Rep	Scientific reports	Adaptation, Physiological; Bacillus; Burkholderiales; Chlorophyll; Cicer; Droughts; Plant Development; Plant Growth Regulators; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Seedlings; Seeds; Stress, Physiological	Khan	Naeem
30758202	10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00750	Both Reactivity and Accessibility Are Important in Cytochrome P450 Metabolism: A Combined DFT and MD Study of Fenamic Acids in BM3 Mutants.	Cytochrome P450 102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BM3) is a fatty acid hydroxylase that has one of the highest turnover rates of any mono-oxygenase. Recent studies have shown how mutants of BM3 can produce metabolites of known drug compounds similar to those observed in humans. Single-point mutations in the binding pocket change the regioselective metabolism of fenamic acids from aromatic hydroxylation to aliphatic hydroxylation. This study is concerned with the individual contribution from accessibility and reactivity for drug metabolism with a future goal to develop fast methods for prediction. For a BM3 M11 mutant as well as the M11 V87F and M11 V87I mutants, we studied the metabolism of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) mefenamic acid, meclofenamic acid, tolfenamic acid, and diclofenac. Density functional theory (DFT; B3LYP and B3LYP-D3) calculations for all possible reactions were performed using a porphyrin model reacting with the four substrates.

Spent catalysts represent an environmental concern, mainly due to their elevated metal content. Although conventional treatment methods for spent catalysts are available, they generate large volumes of potentially harmful wastes and gaseous emissions. To overcome the environmental impact, biotechnological approaches are currently being explored and developed. Thus, the current study assayed the capability of Bacillus megaterium strain MNSH1-9K-1 to remove Al, Ni, V and Ti contained in the spent catalyst coded as ECAT-TL-II. To this end, B. megaterium MNSH1-9K-1 growth and metal uptake abilities in the presence of ECAT-TL-II spent catalyst at 15% (wt/vol) pulp density were evaluated in modified Starkey medium at 37.....C and 200...rpm.

Culture contamination, end-product toxicity, and energy efficient product recovery are long-standing bioprocess challenges. To solve these problems, we propose a high-pressure fermentation strategy, coupled with in situ extraction using the abundant and renewable solvent supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), which is also known for its broad microbial lethality. Towards this goal, we report the domestication and engineering of a scCO2-tolerant strain of Bacillus megaterium, previously isolated from formation waters from the McElmo Dome CO2 field, to produce branched alcohols that have potential use as biofuels. After establishing induced-expression under scCO2, isobutanol production from 2-ketoisovalerate is observed with greater than 40% yield with co-produced isopentanol.

Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are members of an important class of pattern recognition receptors in insects that can specifically recognize peptidoglycan (PGN) in bacterial cell walls and participate in immune regulation and bacterial clearance. Although the role of PGRPs in regulating the innate immune response in Drosophila melanogaster has been studied, little is known regarding PGRPs in Lepidoptera species. In this study, five short (S)-type Bombyx mori PGRPs (BmPGRPs) were cloned, expressed, and evaluated for their function in innate immunity. B. mori larvae that were injected with the gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium or the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli exhibited a rapid and significant upregulation in S-type BmPGRP expression. The results showed that the five evaluated BmPGRPs have significant agglutination activity toward E. coli and B. megaterium and more notable amidase activity toward meso-diaminopimelic acid peptidoglycan (DAP-PGN).

The beneficial effects of plant--bacterial interactions in controlling plant pests have been extensively studied with single bacterial isolates. However, in nature, bacteria interact with plants in multitaxa consortia, systems which remain poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that a consortium of five native bacterial isolates protected their host plant Nicotiana attenuata from a sudden wilt disease. Here we explore the mechanisms behind the protection effect against the native pathosystem. Three members of the consortium, Pseudomonas azotoformans A70, P. frederiksbergensis A176 and Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus E46, form biofilms when grown individually in vitro, and the amount of biofilm increased synergistically in the five-membered consortium, including two Bacillus species, B...megaterium and B...mojavensis.

30537187	10.1111/febs.14722	Novel approach to improve progesterone hydroxylation selectivity by CYP106A2 via rational design of adrenodoxin binding.	Bacterial P450s have considerable potential for biotechnological applications. The P450 CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368 converts progesterone to several hydroxylated products that are important precursors for pharmaceutical substances. As high yields of monohydroxylated products are required for biotechnological processes, improving this conversion is of considerable interest. It has previously been shown that the binding mode of the redox partner can affect the selectivity of the progesterone hydroxylation, being more stringent in case of the Etp1 compared with Adx(4-108). Therefore, in this study we aimed to improve hydroxylation selectivity by optimizing the binding of Adx(4-108) with CYP106A2 allowing for a shorter distance between both redox centers. To change the putative binding interface of Adx(4-108) with CYP106A2, molecular docking was used to choose mutation sites for alteration.

Rock phosphate (RP) is a natural source of phosphorus for agriculture, with the advantage of lower cost and less impact on the environment when compared to synthetic fertilizers. However, the release of phosphorus (P) from RP occurs slowly, which may limit its short-term availability to crops. Hence, the use of P-solubilizing microorganisms to improve the availability of P from this P source is an interesting approach, as microorganisms often perform other functions that assist plant growth, besides solubilizing P. Here, we describe the characterization of 101 bacterial isolates obtained from the rhizosphere and endosphere of maize plants for their P solubilizing activity in vitro, their growth-promoting activity on millet plants cultivated in soil amended with RP, and their gene content especially associated with phosphate solubilization.

After a 60-day soil incubation under controlled conditions (28 ..., darkness), we examined the impacts of single/mixed applications of beneficial bacteria on soil available nutrients and related enzyme activities at different OFP levels and different sampling times (3rd, 8th, 16th, 30th, 45th, 60th day). The results showed that soil available nutrient contents increased with the elevated OFP levels, and exhibited as 12%&gt;8%&gt;4%&gt;0%.

33290766	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.12.015	Production of polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymers containing 4-hydroxybutyrate in engineered Bacillus megaterium.	Despite being used as a common platform for the commercial production of many biochemicals, Bacilli are often overlooked as a source of industrial polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), biodegradable plastic replacements. In addition to having a robust expression system, the lack of lipopolysaccharides and ease of lysis make Bacilli an attractive host for the production of PHAs. In this work, a Bacillus megaterium strain was engineered to generate poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutryate) (P[3HB-co-4HB]) copolymers, which are among the most useful and industrially-relevant copolymers. These copolymers had lower modulus and increased toughness, thus making the copolymer suitable for a broader range of applications. Due to high metabolic flux through succinate, the engineered B. megaterium strain produced P(3HB-co-4HB) with &gt;10% mol fraction 4HB from glucose, without the use of highly regulated and expensive precursors or potentially damaging truncation of central biochemical pathways.	2021	4	27	Int J Biol Macromol	International journal of biological macromolecules	4-hydroxybutyrate; Bacillus megaterium; Biodegradable plastic; Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymers; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Bacillus megaterium; Cupriavidus; Hydroxybutyrates; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Polymers; Succinic Acid; Xylose	Cal	Andrew J

As an important global crop, the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) contains the endotoxin solanine that leads to human poisoning and major economic losses. Poisoning symptoms and even acute poisoning may occur when the content of solanine in potatoes exceeds 200 mg/kg. In addition, potatoes are susceptible to some pathogenic bacteria, including Streptomyces scabies and Erwinia carotovora subsp. atroseptica (Van Hall) dye, which can cause potato scab and potato blackleg disease, respectively. In this study, 37 culturable endophytic bacteria strains were obtained from potato tubers based on the culture-dependent method. Results indicated that nine strains showed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogen by antimicrobial activity screening and 23 strains showed inhibitory activity on solanine in potato tubers.

Due to high manufacturing costs, industrial production and application of bio-based polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) as bioplastics remain below the expected potential. Improving yields and productivities during biotechnological production will contribute to eliminating existing shortcomings and should therefore be a priority in process development with new strains and substrates. The present study investigates key parameters such as different nutrient and oxygen limitation strategies and the salinity and type of salt to determine their impact on growth and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P(3HB)) formation behaviour of Bacillus megaterium. The oxygen-limiting conditions applied resulted in a longer process duration and were found to be least effective with regard to P(3HB) content in the biomass. A higher P(3HB) content of 0.42 g g<sup>-1</sup> was achieved when nitrogen was limited compared to 0.34 g g<sup>-1</sup> under phosphate-limiting conditions; however, sucrose utilization was better when 	2021	9	21	N Biotechnol	New biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; Phosphate limitation; Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); Potassium chloride; Bacillus megaterium; Culture Media; Hydroxybutyrates; Nutrients; Oxygen; Polyesters; Salinity; Salts; Sucrose	Schmid	Maximilian

Calcifediol (25(OH)VD3) is a physiologically very important vitamin D3 metabolite and of high pharmaceutical importance, due to its potential for treating not only vitamin D3 deficiencies but also coronary diseases and cancer. Previously, we established a whole-cell Bacillus megaterium-based system using the cytochrome P450 CYP109A2 for the biotransformation of vitamin D3 into its metabolite 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of the region between amino acids T103 and A106 for the catalytic activity of CYP109A2 towards vitamin D3 as a substrate. In order to increase the productivity of the system, reaction conditions (xylose, vitamin D3, saponin, 2-hydroxypropyl-..-cyclodextrin) were optimized for the in vivo production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. With cells producing the T103A mutant, a productivity of 282.7 mg/L/48 h was achieved under the optimized conditions.

33206970	10.1093/femsle/fnaa174	Analysis of disulphide bond linkage between CoA and protein cysteine thiols during sporulation and in spores of Bacillus species.	Spores of Bacillus species have novel properties, which allow them to lie dormant for years and then germinate under favourable conditions. In the current work, the role of a key metabolic integrator, coenzyme A (CoA), in redox regulation of growing cells and during spore formation in Bacillus megaterium and Bacillus subtilis is studied. Exposing these growing cells to oxidising agents or carbon deprivation resulted in extensive covalent protein modification by CoA (termed protein CoAlation), through disulphide bond formation between the CoA thiol group and a protein cysteine. Significant protein CoAlation was observed during sporulation of B. megaterium, and increased largely in parallel with loss of metabolism in spores. Mass spectrometric analysis identified four CoAlated proteins in B. subtilis spores as well as one CoAlated protein in growing B. megaterium cells. All five of these proteins have been identified as moderately abundant in spores.

Microgels are an emerging class of "ideal" enzyme carriers because of their chemical and process stability, biocompatibility, and high enzyme loading capability. In this work, we synthesized a new type of permanently positively charged poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) microgel with 1-vinyl-3-methylimidazolium (quaternization of nitrogen by methylation of N-vinylimidazole moieties) as a comonomer (PVCL/VimQ) through precipitation polymerization. The PVCL/VimQ microgels were characterized with respect to their size, charge, swelling degree, and temperature responsiveness in aqueous solutions. P450 monooxygenases are usually challenging to immobilize, and often, high activity losses occur after the immobilization (in the case of P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium up to 100% loss of activity). The electrostatic immobilization of P450 BM3 in permanently positively charged PVCL/VimQ microgels was achieved without the loss of catalytic activity at the pH optimum of P450 BM3	2021	6	18	Biomacromolecules	Biomacromolecules	Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Microgels; Oxidation-Reduction	N..th	Maximilian

For microorganisms on a paper surface, the lack of water is one of the most important stress factors. A strain of Bacillus megaterium FDU301 was isolated from plaques on a paper surface using culture medium with polyethylene glycol 200 (PEG200) to simulate an arid condition. Global transcriptomic analysis of B. megaterium FDU301 grown under normal and simulated arid conditions was performed via RNA-seq technology to identify genes involved in arid stress adaptation. The transcriptome of B. megaterium FDU301 grown in LB medium under arid (15% PEG200 (w/w)) and normal conditions were compared. A total of 2941 genes were differentially expressed, including 1422 genes upregulated and 1519 genes downregulated under arid conditions. Oxidative stress-responsive regulatory genes perR, fur, and tipA were significantly upregulated, along with DNA protecting protein (dps), and catalase (katE).

The slow electron transfer rate is the bottleneck to the biological wastewater treatment process, and the nanoparticles (NPs) has been verified as a feasible strategy to improve the biological degradation efficiency by accelerating the electron transfer. Here, we employed the Gram-positive Bacillus megaterium Y-4, capable of synthetizing Pd(0), to investigate the intra/extracellular electron transfer (IET/EET) mechanisms mediated by NPs in aerobic denitrification for the first time. Kinetic and thermodynamic results showed that the bio-Pd(0) could significantly promote the removal of both nitrate and nitrite by improving affinity and decreasing activation energy. The enzymic activity and the respiration chain inhibition experiment indicated that the bio-Pd(0) could facilitate the nitrate biotic reduction by improving the Fe-S center activity and serving as parallel H carriers to replace coenzyme Q to selectively increase the electron flux toward nitrate in IET, while promoting the nitr	2021	1	4	Water Res	Water research	Aerobic denitrifiaction; Bio-Pd(0); Extracellular electron transfer (EET); Intracellular electron transfer (IET); Promotion mechanism; Denitrification; Electron Transport; Electrons; Metal Nanoparticles; Palladium	Jia	Yating

Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) is one of the most valuable biopolymers because of its superior mechanical properties. Here, we developed a bioprocess utilizing recombinant Bacillus megaterium strain for PHBV over-production from glucose, without any precursor addition. PHA production was performed in a controlled bioreactor by batch and fed-batch modes using wild-type B. megaterium and rec-B. megaterium cells overexpressing the native phaC gene.

32971422	10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.08.001	A pilot RNA-seq study in 40 pietrain ejaculates to characterize the porcine sperm microbiome.	The microbiome plays a key role in homeostasis and health and it has been also linked to fertility and semen quality in several animal species including swine. Despite the more than likely importance of sperm bacteria on the boar's reproductive ability and the dissemination of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes, the high throughput characterization of the swine sperm microbiome remains scarce. We carried RNA-seq on 40 ejaculates each from a different Pietrain boar and found that a proportion of the sequencing reads did not map to the Sus scrofa genome. The current study aimed at using these reads not belonging to pig to carry a pilot study to profile the boar sperm bacterial population and its relation with 7 semen quality traits. We found that the boar sperm contains a broad population of bacteria. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (39.1%), Firmicutes (27.5%), Actinobacteria (14.9%) and Bacteroidetes (5.7%).

32871253	10.1016/j.pep.2020.105743	Heterologous expression of cobalamin dependent class-III enzymes.	The family of cobalamin class-III dependent enzymes is composed of the reductive dehalogenases (RDases) and related epoxyqueuosine reductases. RDases are crucial for the energy conserving process of organohalide respiration. These enzymes have the ability to reductively cleave carbon-halogen bonds, present in a number of environmentally hazardous pollutants, making them of significant interest for bioremediation applications. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain sufficient yields of pure RDase isolated from organohalide respiring bacteria for biochemical studies. Hence, robust heterologous expression systems are required that yield the active holo-enzyme which requires both iron-sulphur cluster and cobalamin incorporation. We present a comparative study of the heterologous expression strains Bacillus megaterium, Escherichia coli HMS174(DE3), Shimwellia blattae and a commercial strain of Vibrio natrigenes, for cobalamin class-III dependent enzymes expression.

32870483	10.1007/s12275-020-0292-0	Structural insights into the psychrophilic germinal protease PaGPR and its autoinhibitory loop.	In spore forming microbes, germination protease (GPR) plays a key role in the initiation of the germination process. A critical step during germination is the degradation of small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs), which protect spore DNA from external stresses (UV, heat, low temperature, etc.). Inactive zymogen GPR can be activated by autoprocessing of the N-terminal pro-sequence domain. Activated GPR initiates the degradation of SASPs; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying the activation, catalysis, regulation, and substrate recognition of GPR remain elusive. In this study, we determined the crystal structure of GPR from Paenisporosarcina sp. TG-20 (PaGPR) in its inactive form at a resolution of 2.5 A. Structural analysis showed that the active site of PaGPR is sterically occluded by an inhibitory loop region (residues 202-216). The N-terminal region interacts directly with the self-inhibitory loop region, suggesting that the removal of the N-terminal pro-sequence induces conformat	2021	4	26	J Microbiol	Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)	X-ray crystallography; crystal structure; germination protease; zymogen; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus megaterium; Catalytic Domain; Crystallography, X-Ray; DNA, Bacterial; Endopeptidases; Enzyme Precursors; Planococcaceae; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Sequence Alignment; Spores, Bacterial	Lee	Chang Woo

32815305	10.1002/ps.6057	Efficacy of Bacillus megaterium strain Sneb207 against soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines) in soybean.	The soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) is the most devastating and yield-limiting pest in soybean worldwide. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, biological control becomes more and more urgent. The Bacillus megaterium Sneb207 has previously shown the ability to inhibit the movement of SCN, but little is known about its effect on nematode control in agricultural settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of Sneb207 against SCN and investigate the ability of Sneb207 to induce systemic resistance to H. glycines in soybean. The stability and efficiency of SCN control by Sneb207 was assessed in two field experiments. Compared to non-treated control, Sneb207 significantly reduced the number of cysts, SCN juveniles, and eggs, while it promoted soybean growth. Furthermore, results of two pot experiments showed that the number of initial infections of second-stage juveniles were 231.75 and 131.3 after Sneb207 treatment, respectively, lowe	2020	12	21	Pest Manag Sci	Pest management science	Bacillus megaterium strain Sneb207; Heterodera glycines; biological control; induced systemic resistance; Animals; Bacillus megaterium; Cysts; Plant Diseases; Soybeans; Tylenchoidea	Zhou	Yuanyuan

32661278	10.1038/s41477-020-0707-2	DNA demethylases are required for myo-inositol-mediated mutualism between plants and beneficial rhizobacteria.	Root-associated soil bacteria can strongly influence plant fitness. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark important to many fundamental biological processes; however, its roles in plant interactions with beneficial microbes remain elusive. Here, we report that active DNA demethylation in Arabidopsis controls root secretion of myo-inositol and consequently plant growth promotion triggered by Bacillus megaterium strain YC4. Root-secreted myo-inositol is critical for YC4 colonization and preferentially attracts B. megaterium among the examined bacteria species. Active DNA demethylation antagonizes RNA-directed DNA methylation in controlling myo-inositol homeostasis. Importantly, we demonstrate that active DNA demethylation controls myo-inositol-mediated mutualism between YC4 and Solanum lycopersicum, thus suggesting a conserved nature of this epigenetic regulatory mechanism.	2021	3	29	Nat Plants	Nature plants	Arabidopsis; Bacillus megaterium; DNA Methylation; Homeostasis; Inositol; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Roots; Symbiosis	V..lchez	Juan I
32656603	10.1007/s11274-020-02887-2	Metabolically engineered Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131 as a novel producer of optically pure L- and D-lactate.	High-quality environmentally-friendly bioplastics can be produced by mixing poly-L-lactate with poly-D-lactate. On an industrial scale, this process simultaneously consumes large amounts of both optically pure lactate stereoisomers. However, because optimal growth conditions of L-lactate producers often differ from those of D-lactate producers, each stereoisomer is produced in a specialised facility, which raises cost and lowers sustainability. To address this challenge, we metabolically engineered Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131<sup>T</sup>, a bioprocess-friendly and genetically malleable strain of homofermentative lactic acid bacterium, to efficiently produce either pure L- or pure D-lactate under the same bioprocess conditions.

With the constant accumulation of electronic waste, extracting precious metals contained therein is becoming a major challenge for sustainable development. Bacillus megaterium is currently one of the microbes used for the production of cyanide, which is the main leaching agent for gold recovery. The present study aimed to propose a strategy for metabolic engineering of B. megaterium to overproduce cyanide, and thus ameliorate the bioleaching process. For this, we employed constraint-based modeling, running in silico simulations on iJA1121, the genome-scale metabolic model of B. megaterium DSM319. Flux balance analysis (FBA) was initially used to identify amino acids to be added to the culture medium. Considering cyanide as the desired product, we used growth-coupled methods, constrained minimal cut sets (cMCSs) and OptKnock to identify gene inactivation targets.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyse reactions of significant industrial interest but are underutilised in large-scale bioprocesses due to enzyme stability, cofactor requirements and the poor aqueous solubility and microbial toxicity of typical substrates and products. In this work, we investigate the potential for preparative-scale N-demethylation of the opium poppy alkaloid noscapine by a P450BM3 (CYP102A1) mutant enzyme in a whole-cell biotransformation system. We identify and address several common limitations of whole-cell P450 biotransformations using this model N-demethylation process.

Cytochrome P450BM-3 (P450BM-3) is a flavoprotein reductase-heme fusion protein from the bacterium Bacillus megaterium that has been well-characterized in many biophysical aspects. Although the enzyme is known to catalyze the hydroxylation of medium and long-chain fatty acids at high rates, no definitive physiological function has been associated with this process in the organism other than a possible protective role. We found that P450BM-3 rapidly hydroxylates alkyl sulfates, particularly those with 12-16 carbons (i.e., including dodecyl sulfate) in a similar manner to the fatty acids. The products were characterized as primarily ..-1 hydroxylated alkyl sulfates (plus some ..-2 and ..-3 hydroxylation products), and some further oxidation to dihydroxy and keto derivatives also occurred.

32324965	10.1002/cbic.202000196	Evolution of Glucose Dehydrogenase for Cofactor Regeneration in Bioredox Processes with Denaturing Agents.	Glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is a general tool for driving nicotinamide (NAD(P)H) regeneration in synthetic biochemistry. An increasing number of synthetic bioreactions are carried out in media containing high amounts of organic cosolvents or hydrophobic substrates/products, which often denature native enzymes, including those for cofactor regeneration. In this work, we attempted to improve the chemical stability of Bacillus megaterium GDH (BmGDHM0 ) in the presence of large amounts of 1-phenylethanol by directed evolution. Among the resulting mutants, BmGDHM6 (Q252L/E170K/S100P/K166R/V72I/K137R) exhibited a 9.2-fold increase in tolerance against 10...% (v/v) 1-phenylethanol. Moreover, BmGDHM6 was also more stable than BmGDHM0 when exposed to hydrophobic and enzyme-inactivating compounds such as acetophenone, ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate, and ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate.

32285177	10.1007/s00253-020-10594-z	A coupled enzymatic reaction of tyrosinase and glucose dehydrogenase for the production of hydroxytyrosol.	Hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a diphenolic compound prevalent mainly in olives with pronounced antioxidant activity and proven benefits for human health. Current production limitations have motivated studies concerning the hydroxylation of tyrosol to HT with tyrosinase; however, accumulation of the diphenol is restricted due to its rapid subsequent oxidation to 3,4-quinone-phenylethanol. In this study, a continuous two-enzyme reaction system of sol-gel-immobilized tyrosinase and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was developed for the synthesis of HT. Purified tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (TyrBm) and E. coli cell extract expressing GDH from B. megaterium were encapsulated in a sol-gel matrix based on triethoxysilane precursors. While tyrosinase oxidized tyrosol to 3,4-quinone-phenylethanol, GDH catalyzed the simultaneous reduction of the cofactor NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH, which was the reducing agent enabling the accumulation of HT.

The importance of bioinoculants as biocontrol agents to combat phytopathogens has been widely recognized. However, little information exists with respect to their role in inhibiting human pathogens in the rhizosphere. The present study is an attempt to understand the impact of an established bacterial consortium, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium, and Pseudomonas fluorescens, on the survivability of Listeria monocytogenes in the rhizosphere of Cajanus cajan and Festuca arundinacea.

Compared to the biological world's rich chemistry for functionalizing carbon, enzymatic transformations of the heavier homologue silicon are rare. We report that a wild-type cytochrome...P450 monooxygenase (P450BM3 from Bacillus megaterium, CYP102A1) has promiscuous activity for oxidation of hydrosilanes to give silanols. Directed evolution was applied to enhance this non-native activity and create a highly efficient catalyst for selective silane oxidation under mild conditions with oxygen as the terminal oxidant. The evolved enzyme leaves C-H bonds present in the silane substrates untouched, and this biotransformation does not lead to disiloxane formation, a common problem in silanol syntheses. Computational studies reveal that catalysis proceeds through hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical rebound, as observed in the native C-H hydroxylation mechanism of the P450 enzyme. This enzymatic silane oxidation extends nature's impressive catalytic repertoire.	2021	3	18	Angew Chem Int Ed Engl	Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)	P450 enzymes; biocatalysis; directed evolution; monooxygenation; silanols; Bacillus megaterium; Biocatalysis; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Models, Molecular; Oxidation-Reduction; Silanes	B..hr	Susanne

For many years now, Bacillus megaterium serves as a microbial workhorse for the high-level production of recombinant proteins in the g/L-scale. However, efficient and stable production processes require the knowledge of the molecular adaptation strategies of the host organism to establish optimal environmental conditions. Here, we interrogated the osmotic stress response of B. megaterium using transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and fluxome analyses. An initial transient adaptation consisted of potassium import and glutamate counterion synthesis. The massive synthesis of the compatible solute proline constituted the second longterm adaptation process. Several stress response enzymes involved in iron scavenging and reactive oxygen species (ROS) fighting proteins showed higher levels under prolonged osmotic stress induced by 1.8 M NaCl. At the same time, the downregulation of the expression of genes of the upper part of glycolysis resulted in the activation of the pentose 	2020	9	28	Front Bioeng Biotechnol	Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium; flux analysis; osmotic stress adaptation; polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); proline; proteomics; transcriptomics	Godard	Thibault

Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are beneficial microbes that increase plant growth and yield. However, limited information is currently available on PGPB in onion (Allium cepa Linn.). The aims of the present study were to isolate and identify PGPB in onion and examine the effects of isolated PGPB on germination and growth during the vegetative stage in onion, pak choy (Brassica chinensis), and sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum). Twenty-three strains of PGPB were isolated from the roots, bulbs, and rhizosphere soil of onion. All isolated bacterial strains showed one or more PGP traits, including indole acetic acid production, phosphate solubilization ability, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase and nitrogenase activities; most of these traits were derived from Bacillus sp., Microbacterium sp., and Pseudomonas sp. Eight bacteria that exhibited strong abilities to produce indole acetic acid were selected for a Petri dish trial, soil pot test, and vermiculate pot test.

Inactivation of Bacillales and Clostridiales spores is of interest, since some cause food spoilage and human diseases. A recent publication (mSphere 3: e00597-1, 2018) reported that glycerol monolaurate (GML) in a non-aqueous gel (GMLg) effectively killed spores of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Clostridioides difficile, and Bacillus anthracis spores to a lesser extent. We now show that (i) the B. subtilis spores prepared as in the prior work were impure; (ii) if spore viability was measured by diluting spores 1/10 in GMLg, serially diluting incubations 10-fold and spotting aliquots on recovery plates, there was no colony formation from the 1/10 to 1/1000 dilutions due to GMLg carryover, although thorough ethanol washes of incubated spores eliminated this problem and (iii) GMLg did not kill highly purified spores of B. subtilis, B. cereus, Bacillus megaterium and C. difficile in 3-20..h in the conditions used in the recent publication.

Vitamin D2 is a form of vitamin D derived from mushrooms and plants which is structurally modified in the body due to the action of several enzymes. The resulting metabolites represent important compounds with potential bioactive properties. However, they are poorly studied and their availability is mostly limited. In order to identify new enzymes capable of producing vitamin D2 metabolites, we investigated a bacterial P450 monooxygenase, CYP109E1, which was previously shown to be a vitamin D3 hydroxylase. It was found that CYP109E1 catalyzes a vitamin D2 two-step hydroxylation at positions C24 and C25 resulting in the generation of 24(R),25-diOH VD2. Interestingly, the enzyme showed high selectivity towards vitamin D2, whereas it showed an unselective product pattern for the structurally similar vitamin D3.

35003874	10.1364/BOE.445041	Classification of two species of Gram-positive bacteria through hyperspectral microscopy coupled with machine learning.	Gram stain is one of the most common techniques used to visualize bacteria under microscopy and classify bacteria into two large groups (Gram-positive and Gram-negative). However, such an inaccurate classification is unfavorable for bacterial research. For instance, soil-rhizosphere bacteria, Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) have different effects on plants, nonetheless, they are both Gram-positive and difficult to be differentiated. Here, we present a method to precisely classify Gram-positive bacteria via hyperspectral microscopy. The pH-value differences in the intracellular environment of various types of bacteria can lead to different ionization of the auxochrome of crystal violet (CV) molecules during the Gram stain process. Consequently, there is a subtle difference in the absorption peak of Gram-stained bacteria. Harnessing hyperspectral microscopy can capture this subtle difference and enable precise classification	2022	1	11	Biomed Opt Express	Biomedical optics express	NA	Liu	Kunxing

Theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TFDG) in black tea possesses several health benefits. However, low TFDG yields limit its application. Herein, tyrosinases from Bacillus megaterium (Bmtyrc) were used to synthesize TFDG. To improve the catalytic efficiency of tyrosinase, a directed evolution strategy and a high-throughput screening method was employed.

Maltopentaose-forming amylases are promising enzymes for their ability to hydrolyze starch and produce functional maltooligosaccharides. Two maltopentaose-forming amylase genes from Bacillus megaterium (BmMFA) and Saccharophagus degradans (SdMFA) were expressed heterologously and their characteristics were analyzed. BmMFA has substantial thermostability and SdMFA owns superior product specificity. The carbohydrate-binding module of SdMFA was fused with BmMFA and the fused protein showed ideal enzymatic properties and displayed potential for industrial production of maltopentaose. Under the optimized conditions, the final product containing 47.41% maltopentaose was obtained with a conversion rate of 92.67% from starch.

The tested hypothesis in this study is that modified N-alkylaminated chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) have selective binding properties to Gram-negative bacteria strains that result in bacterial aggregation. Various bacterial strains were tested of five Gram-negative bacteria including Erwinia carotovora, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, and Serratia marcescens, as well as three Gram-positive bacteria strains including Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus subtilis.

We investigated the ability of microbial volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) emitted by Bacillus megaterium (a well-known MVOC producer) to modify the dissolution kinetics and surface of hydroxyapatite, a natural soil mineral. Facilitated phosphate release was induced by the airborne MVOCs in a time-dependent manner. Use of each standard chemical of the MVOCs then revealed that acetic and oxalic acids are crucial for the phenomenon. In addition, the ability of such MVOCs to engineer the apatite surfaces was evidenced by FT-IR spectra showing the COO<sup>-</sup> band variation with incubation time and the prolonged acceleration of phosphate release during the negligible acidification of the hydroxyapatite-containing solutions. The formation of calcium oxalate was revealed through SEM-EDS and XRD analyses, suggesting that MVOC oxalic acid interacts with calcium ions, leading to the precipitation of calcium oxalate, thus preventing the recrystallization of calcium phosphates.

CYP102A1 (BM3) is a catalytically self-sufficient flavocytochrome fusion protein isolated from Bacillus megaterium, which displays similar metabolic capabilities to many drug-metabolizing human P450 isoforms. BM3's high catalytic efficiency, ease of production and malleable active site makes the enzyme a desirable tool in the production of small molecule metabolites, especially for compounds that exhibit drug-like chemical properties. The engineering of select key residues within the BM3 active site vastly expands the catalytic repertoire, generating variants which can perform a range of modifications. This provides an attractive alternative route to the production of valuable compounds that are often laborious to synthesize via traditional organic means.

Drought is a major threat to crop productivity and causes decreased plant growth, poor yields, and crop failure. Nevertheless, the frequency of droughts is expected to increase in the coming decades. The microbial communities associated with crop plants can influence how plants respond to various stresses; hence, microbiome manipulation is fast becoming an effective strategy for improving the stress tolerance of plants. The effect of drought stress on the root microbiome of perennial woody plants is currently poorly understood. Using Populus trees as a model ecosystem, we found that the diversity of the root microbial community decreased during drought treatment and that compositional shifts in microbes during drought stress were driven by the relative abundances of a large number of dominant phyla, including Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria.

Bioproduction of optical pure (R)-citronellal from (E/Z)-citral at high substrate loading remains challenging. Low catalytic efficiency of (R)-stereoselective ene reductases towards crude citral mixture is one of the major bottlenecks. Herein, a structure-based engineering strategy was adopted to enhance the catalytic efficiency and stereoselectivity of an ene reductase (OYE2p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae YJM1341 towards (E/Z)-citral. On basis of homologous modelling, molecular docking analysis and alanine scanning at the binding pocket of OYE2p, a mutant Y84A was obtained with simultaneous increase in catalytic efficiency and stereoselectivity. Furthermore, site-saturation mutagenesis of Y84 yielded seven mutants with improved activity and stereoselectivity in the (E/Z)-citral reduction. Among them, the variant Y84V exhibited an 18.3% and 71.3% rise in catalytic efficiency (kcat /Km ) for (Z)-citral and (E)-citral respectively.

Despite numerous environmental benefits, biological pre-treatment has been side-lined due to its prolonged periods of fermentation, ascribed to the slow growth rate of lignin degrading organisms. Thus, the present work adopted a dual phase statistical optimization approach for the biological pre-treatment of sugarcane bagasse, with Pycnoporus coccineus MScMS1, using Taguchi Orthogonal Array, in conjunction with Response Surface Methodology, to address this issue.

Bt is also genetically similar to Bacillus cereus (Bc), a well recognized foodborne human pathogen; they are both members of the Bacillus cereus group (BC group). Although approved Bt bioinsecticide products have been confirmed to be non-pathogenic to humans, close monitoring of Bt during dissemination is important for cost considerations and to limit impact on biodiversity towards nontarget organisms. As such, developing rapid, sensitive, and specific tools for quantitative detection of Bt spores during and following spray operations is highly desirable. The goals of this study were to investigate commercially available detection reagents for sensitivity and selectivity in detecting Bt spores, and then functionalize a surface of (001) GaAs used in photonic biosensing.

Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are in increasing demand due to their role in promoting sustainable practices, not only in agriculture but also in forestry. Keeping in mind the future application of PGPR for increasing cork oak sustainability, the aim of this study was to find cork oak PGPR isolates with increased nutrient solubilisation traits, able to promote root morphological changes and/or antagonize cork oak bark phytopathogens. Soils from three cork oak forests with distinct bioclimates (humid, semi-humid and semi-arid) were used for isolating bacteria. From the 7634 colony-forming units, 323 bacterial isolates were biochemically assayed for PGPR traits (siderophores production, phosphate solubilizing and organic acids production), and 51 were found to display all these traits. These PGPR were able to induce root morphological changes on Arabidopsis thaliana, like suppression of primary root growth, increase of lateral roots or root hairs formation.

34576760	10.3390/microorganisms9091866	Polyphenol-Hydroxylating Tyrosinase Activity under Acidic pH Enables Efficient Synthesis of Plant Catechols and Gallols.	Tyrosinase is generally known as a melanin-forming enzyme, facilitating monooxygenation of phenols, oxidation of catechols into quinones, and finally generating biological melanin. As a homologous form of tyrosinase in plants, plant polyphenol oxidases perform the same oxidation reactions specifically toward plant polyphenols. Recent studies reported synthetic strategies for large scale preparation of hydroxylated plant polyphenols, using bacterial tyrosinases rather than plant polyphenol oxidase or other monooxygenases, by leveraging its robust monophenolase activity and broad substrate specificity. Herein, we report a novel synthesis of functional plant polyphenols, especially quercetin and myricetin from kaempferol, using screened bacterial tyrosinases. The critical bottleneck of the biocatalysis was identified as instability of the catechol and gallol under neutral and basic conditions.

Cement is an essential material used in constructional activities. An emerging concern in the industry however is the CO2 emissions, which are triggered by cement manufacturing units. These emissions can be controlled to some extent by not using cement exclusively and instead replacing a percentage of it with waste material with properties similar to cement. Electric arc furnace dust (EAFD) and rice straw ash (RSA) are waste materials from industrial and agricultural sources which also contain similar constituents that are present in cement. Thus, the objective of this study is to check the effect of EAFD and RSA on concrete properties with the application of Aspergillus niger and Bacillus megaterium. Taguchi's design of experiments has been utilised to explore the effect of operating parameters (i.e. EAFD and RSA replacement (5%, 10% and 15%), curing period of concrete cubes (7, 14 and 28 days) and cell count of fungus/bacteria (10<sup>4</sup>, 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>8</	2021	9	17	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Environmental science and pollution research international	Aspergillus niger; Bacillus megaterium; Electric arc furnace dust; Rice straw ash; Sustainable bio-concrete production	Sodhi	Amanpreet Kaur

The antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) in Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have attracted increasing attention. In this study, the abundance of ARB and resistance genes tet32 and defA1 were investigated using high-throughput sequencing and high-throughput qPCR in water samples collected from the inlet of the biological treatment pool and outlet of Beilun Yandong WWTP in Ningbo, China. The result shows there was a high level of ARGs in the water of both the inlets and outlets in 2017 and 2018, whereas no ARGs were detected after adding a new baffled bioreactor (BBR) water treatment process in 2019. The BBR process uses Bacillus subtilis, B. thuringiensis, B. megaterium, B. licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens to effectively eliminate the ARGs in wastewater. Notably, this process did not significantly change the bacterial community structure of outlet water samples. The findings demonstrate an effective new method for removing ARGs from sewage.	2022	2	17	Bull Environ Contam Toxicol	Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology	Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; Bacillus spp; Baffled bioreactor; Wastewater treatment plants; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Genes, Bacterial; Waste Water; Water Purification	Weng	Zi-Fan

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are promising candidates for anti-infective drugs. The majority of AMPs are considered to disrupt the lipid matrix of bacterial membranes, exerting bactericidal activity. A number of biophysical studies have been carried out to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. However, the fact that the number of peptide molecules bound to a bacterial cell under bactericidal conditions is much larger than that expected from liposomal studies raises the question of whether membrane permeabilization mechanisms proposed by liposomal studies are relevant to bacteria. In this study, the peptide-to-lipid molar ratio needed for an antimicrobial magainin peptide to permeabilize the cell membrane of the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus megaterium was estimated by random fluorescence resonance energy transfer from a BODIPY FL-labeled lipid to a Texas Red-labeled peptide.

34477863	10.1093/femsyr/foab049	Development of an Haa1-based biosensor for acetic acid sensing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.	Acetic acid is one of the main inhibitors of lignocellulosic hydrolysates and acetic acid tolerance is crucial for the development of robust cell factories for conversion of biomass. As a precursor of acetyl-coenzyme A, it also plays an important role in central carbon metabolism. Thus, monitoring acetic acid levels is a crucial aspect when cultivating yeast. Transcription factor-based biosensors represent useful tools to follow metabolite concentrations. Here, we present the development of an acetic acid biosensor based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor Haa1 that upon binding to acetic acid relocates to the nucleus. In the biosensor, a synthetic transcription factor consisting of Haa1 and BM3R1 from Bacillus megaterium was used to control expression of a reporter gene under a promoter containing BM3R1 binding sites. The biosensor did not drive expression under a promoter containing Haa1 binding sites and responded to acetic acid over a linear range spanning from 10 	2022	1	31	FEMS Yeast Res	FEMS yeast research	Haa1; acetic acid; biosensor; synthetic transcription factor; Acetic Acid; Biosensing Techniques; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors	Mormino	Maurizio

On average less than 1% of the total phosphorous present in soils is available to plants, making phosphorous one of the most limiting macronutrients for crop productivity worldwide. The aim of this work was to isolate and select phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) from the barley rhizosphere, which has other growth promoting traits and can increase crop productivity. A total of 104 different bacterial isolates were extracted from the barley plant rhizosphere. In this case, 64 strains were able to solubilize phosphate in agar plates. The 24 strains exhibiting the highest solubilizing index belonged to 16 different species, of which 7 isolates were discarded since they were identified as putative phytopathogens.

Phlorizin is the most abundant glucoside of phloretin from the apple tree and its products. Phlorizin and its aglycone phloretin are currently considered health-beneficial polyphenols from apples useful in treating hyperglycemia and obesity. Recently, we showed that phloretin could be regioselectively hydroxylated to make 3-OH phloretin by Bacillus megaterium CYP102A1 and human P450 enzymes. The 3-OH phloretin has a potent inhibitory effect on differentiating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes and lipid accumulation. The glucoside of 3-OH phloretin would be a promising agent with increased bioavailability and water solubility compared with its aglycone. However, procedures to make 3-OH phlorizin, a glucoside of 3-OH phloretin, using chemical methods, are not currently available. Here, a biocatalytic strategy for the efficient synthesis of a possibly valuable hydroxylated product, 3-OH phlorizin, was developed via CYP102A1-catalyzed regioselective hydroxylation.

The rhizosphere is a dynamic and complex interface between plant roots and microorganisms. Owing to exudates, a web of interactions establishes among the microbial members of this micro-environment. The present study explored the impact of a bacterial consortium (Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas fluorescens, ABP), on the fate of a human pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e, in soil and in the rhizospheres of Cajanus cajan and Festuca arundinacea, in addition to its plant growth promoting effect. The study further assessed the impact these bioinoculants exert on the autochthonous soil bacterial communities. Experiments in sterilised soil inoculated with bioinoculants and L. monocytogenes revealed the inhibition of L. monocytogenes by approximately 80-fold compared to that without the consortium. Subsequently, experiments were conducted in non-sterile soil microcosms planted with C. cajan and F. arundinacea, and in bulk soil.

34382787	10.1021/jacs.1c03079	Synthesis of Multi-Protein Complexes through Charge-Directed Sequential Activation of Tyrosine Residues.	Site-selective protein-protein coupling has long been a goal of chemical biology research. In recent years, that goal has been realized to varying degrees through a number of techniques, including the use of tyrosinase-based coupling strategies. Early publications utilizing tyrosinase from Agaricus bisporus(abTYR) showed the potential to convert tyrosine residues into ortho-quinone functional groups, but this enzyme is challenging to produce recombinantly and suffers from some limitations in substrate scope. Initial screens of several tyrosinase candidates revealed that the tyrosinase from Bacillus megaterium (megaTYR) is an enzyme that possesses a broad substrate tolerance. We use the expanded substrate preference as a starting point for protein design experiments and show that single point mutants of megaTYR are capable of activating tyrosine residues in various sequence contexts.

Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) is currently viewed as one of the potential prominent processes for field applications towards the prevention of soil erosion, healing cracks in bricks, and groundwater contamination. Typically, the bacteria involved in MICP manipulate their environment leading to calcite precipitation with an enzyme such as urease, causing calcite crystals to form on the surface of grains forming cementation bonds between particles that help in reducing soil permeability and increase overall compressive strength. In this paper, the main focus is to study the MICP performance of three indigenous landfill bacteria against a well-known commercially bought MICP bacteria (Bacillus megaterium) using sand columns. In order to check the viability of the method for potential field conditions, the tests were carried out at slightly less favourable environmental conditions, i.e., at temperatures between 15-17..C and without the addition of urease enzymes.

Stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis tritici) is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. The most effective ways to control stripe rust are the use of resistant cultivars and the timely use of an appropriate dose of fungicide. However, the changing nature of rust pathogen outwits the use of resistant cultivars, and the use of a fungicide is associated with environmental problems. To control the disease without sacrificing the environment, we screened 16 endophytic bacteria, which were isolated from stripe rust-resistant wheat cultivars in our previous study, for their biocontrol potential.

Water deficit is one of the major constraints to crop production and food security worldwide. Some plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains are capable of increasing plant drought resistance. Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying bacteria-induced plant drought resistance is important for PGPR applications in agriculture. In this study, we show the drought stress-mitigating effects on tomato plants by the Bacillus megaterium strain TG1-E1, followed by the profiling of plant transcriptomic responses to TG1-E1 and the profiling of bacterial extracellular metabolites. Comparison between the transcriptomes of drought-stressed plants with and without TG1-E1 inoculation revealed bacteria-induced transcriptome reprograming, with highlights on differentially expressed genes belonging to the functional categories including transcription factors, signal transduction, and cell wall biogenesis and organization.

High production costs still hamper fast expansion of commercial production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). This problem is greatly related to the cultivation medium which accounts for up to 50% of the whole process costs. The aim of this research work was to evaluate the potential of using volatile fatty acids (VFAs), derived from acidogenic fermentation of food waste, as inexpensive carbon sources for the production of PHAs through bacterial cultivation. Bacillus megaterium could assimilate glucose, acetic acid, butyric acid, and caproic acid as single carbon sources in synthetic medium with maximum PHAs production yields of 9-11%, on a cell dry weight basis. Single carbon sources were then replaced by a mixture of synthetic VFAs and by a VFAs-rich stream from the acidogenic fermentation of food waste. After 72..h of cultivation, the VFAs were almost fully consumed by the bacterium in both media and PHAs production yields of 9-10%, on cell dry weight basis, were obtained.

Synthetic microbial communities have the potential to enable new platforms for bioproduction of biofuels and biopharmaceuticals. However, using engineered communities is often assumed to be difficult because of anticipated challenges in establishing and controlling community composition. Cross-feeding between microbial auxotrophs has the potential to facilitate coculture growth and stability through a mutualistic ecological interaction. We assessed cross-feeding between 13 Escherichia coli amino acid auxotrophs paired with a leucine auxotroph of Bacillus megaterium. We developed a minimal medium capable of supporting the growth of both bacteria and used the media to study coculture growth of the 13 interspecies pairs of auxotrophs in batch and continuous culture, as well as on semi-solid media. In batch culture, 8 of 13 pairs of auxotrophs were observed to grow in coculture. We developed a new metric to quantify the impact of cross-feeding on coculture growth.

Cytochrome P450 enzymes have attracted much interest over the years given their ability to insert oxygen into saturated carbon-hydrogen bonds, a difficult feat to accomplish by traditional chemistry. Much of the activity in this field has centered on the bacterial enzyme CYP102A1, or BM3, from Bacillus megaterium, as it has shown itself capable of hydroxylating/acting upon a wide range of substrates, thereby producing industrially relevant pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and hormones. In addition, unlike most cytochromes, BM3 is both soluble and fused to its natural redox partner, thus facilitating its use. The industrial use of BM3 is however stifled by its instability and its requirement for the expensive NADPH cofactor. In this work, we added several mutations to the BM3 mutant R966D/W1046S that enhanced the turnover number achievable with the inexpensive cofactors NADH and NBAH.

33686628	10.1007/s12010-021-03541-9	Application of Dual Promoter Expression System for the Enhanced Heparosan Production in Bacillus megaterium.	Heparosan, a capsular polysaccharide synthesized by certain pathogenic bacteria, is a promising precursor for heparin production. Heparosan production is catalyzed by the formation of KfiC-KfiA complex and the subsequent action of KfiC and KfiA proteins. Polycistronic expression of kfiC and kfiA in Bacillus megaterium yielded an unbalanced expression of KfiC and KfiA proteins resulted in decreased heparosan production. In this study, dual promoter plasmid system was constructed to increase the expression levels of KfiC and KfiA proteins. Dual promoter plasmid system along with UDP-glucuronic acid pathway overexpression (CADuet-DB) increased the heparosan production to 203 mg/L in shake flask experiments. Batch fermentation of strain CADuet-DB under controlled conditions yielded a maximum heparosan concentration of 627 mg/L, which is 59% higher than strain CA-DB. A modified logistic model is applied to describe the kinetics of heparosan production and biomass growth.

Bacillus megaterium has become increasingly important for the biotechnological production of valuable compounds of industrial and pharmaceutical importance. Despite recent advances in rational strain design of B. megaterium, these studies have been largely impaired by the lack of molecular tools that are not state-of-the-art for comprehensive genome engineering approaches. In the current work, we describe the adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 vector pJOE8999 to enable efficient genome editing in B. megaterium. Crucial modifications comprise the exchange of promoter elements and associated ribosomal binding sites as well as the implementation of a 5-fluorouracil based counterselection system to facilitate proper plasmid curing. In addition, the functionality and performance of the new CRISPR-Cas9 vector pMOE was successfully evaluated by chromosomal disruption studies of the endogenous ..-galactosidase gene (BMD_2126) and demonstrated an outstanding efficiency of 100 % based on combinatoria	2021	9	24	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus megaterium (Priestia megaterium); CRISPR-Cas9; Genome editing; Novel glucocorticoid esters; Steroid esterase; Bacillus megaterium; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Gene Editing; Plasmids; Promoter Regions, Genetic	Hartz	Philip

The objective of this study was to investigate the transport behaviour of two organic and persistent contaminants (alachlor and pentachlorobenzene) on Danube alluvial sediment in the absence and in the presence of microbially inoculated biochar produced at 400 ..C and three hydrochars produced at 180, 200 and 220 ..C. Stainless steel columns were used for the sorption experiments in non-equilibrium conditions. Obtained results were modelled using the advective-dispersive equation (ADE) under nonequilibrium conditions. Transport of these compounds through the alluvial sediment column showed that the retention time increased with increasing molecular hydrophobicity. Inoculated biochar increases the retardation of both compounds: twofold for pentachlorobenzene compared with alachlor as a consequence of a higher hydrophobicity.

K. vulgare can transform l-sorbose to 2-KLG, but the yield of 2-KLG is much lower in the monoculture than in the coculture fermentation system. The relationship between the two strains is too diverse to analyze and has been a hot topic in the field of vitamin C fermentation. With the development of omics technology, the relationships between the two strains are well explained; nevertheless, the cell-cell communication is unclear. In this review, based on current omics results, the interactions between the two strains are summarized, and the poten	2022	9	26	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Bacillus strains; Ketogulonicigenium vulgare; cell-cell communication; interactions; l-ascorbic acid; Ascorbic Acid; Fermentation; Gluconobacter oxydans; Microbial Interactions; Rhodobacteraceae; Sorbose; Sugar Acids; Vitamins	Zhang	Qian
36066452	10.1093/plphys/kiac418	Root acid phosphatases and rhizobacteria synergistically enhance white lupin and rice phosphorus acquisition.	The rhizosheath is a belowground area that acts as a communication hub at the root-soil interface to promote water and nutrient acquisition. Certain crops, such as white lupin (Lupinus albus), acquire large amounts of phosphorus (P), owing partially to exudation of acid phosphatases (APases). Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria also increase soil P availability. However, potential synergistic effects of root APases and rhizosheath-associated microbiota on P acquisition require further research. In this study, we investigated the roles of root purple APases (PAPs) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in rhizosheath formation and P acquisition under conditions of soil drying (SD) and P treatment (+P: soil with P fertilizer; -P: soil without fertilizer). We expressed purple acid phosphatase12 (LaPAP12) in white lupin and rice (Oryza sativa) plants and analyzed the rhizosheath-associated microbiome.

36054994	10.1016/j.bmc.2022.116968	A mini-review on synthesis and antiviral activity of natural product oxetanocin A derivatives.	Oxetanocin A (Oxt-A), a novel oxetanosyl N-glycoside nucleoside, was isolated from Bacillus megaterium in 1986. It carries an oxetane ring on the sugar moiety of the nucleoside scaffold, which contributes to differences in its structure from those of common tetrahydrofuranyl-based nucleosides. In view of the unique 3D-spatial framework, the complete synthesis of Oxt-A has been achieved by multiple research groups. The pharmacological properties of this natural product have also been broadly investigated by pharmacists and chemists since its discovery. Notably, the potential antiviral effect of Oxt-A has captured attention of researchers in the field of antiviral agent development. Furthermore, epidemic outbreaks caused by viruses have been stimulating the preparation and modification of various Oxt-A analogs over the past few decades. However, none of the studies have overviewed the antiviral efficacies of this naturally occurring scaffold yet.

The regioselective hydroxylation of phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, is still a bottleneck of classical organic chemistry that could be solved using enzymes with high activity and specificity. Yeast Rhodotorula glutinis KCh735 in known to catalyze the C-8 hydroxylation of flavones and flavanones. The enzyme F8H (flavonoid C8-hydroxylase) is involved in the reaction, but the specific gene has not yet been identified. In this work, we present identification, heterologous expression and characterization of the first F8H ortho-hydroxylase from yeast. Differential transcriptome analysis and homology to bacterial monooxygenases, including also a FAD-dependent motif and a GD motif characteristic for flavin-dependent monooxygenases, provided a set of coding sequences among which RgF8H was identified. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that RgF8H is a member of the flavin monooxygenase group active on flavonoid substrates.

36035726	10.3389/fpls.2022.956391	A response surface methodology approach to improve nitrogen use efficiency in maize by an optimal mycorrhiza-to-<i>Bacillus</i> co-inoculation rate.	Co-inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and bacteria can synergically and potentially increase nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in plants, thus, reducing nitrogen (N) fertilizers use and their environmental impact. However, limited research is available on AMF-bacteria interaction, and the definition of synergisms or antagonistic effects is unexplored. In this study, we adopted a response surface methodology (RSM) to assess the optimal combination of AMF (Rhizoglomus irregulare and Funneliformis mosseae) and Bacillus megaterium (a PGPR-plant growth promoting rhizobacteria) formulations to maximize agronomical and chemical parameters linked to N utilization in maize (Zea mays L.). The fitted mathematical models, and also 3D response surface and contour plots, allowed us to determine the optimal AMF and bacterial doses, which are approximately accorded to 2.1 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of both formulations.

The environmental deterioration produced by heavy metals derived from anthropogenic activities has gradually increased. The worldwide dissemination of toxic metals in crop soils represents a threat for sustainability and biosafety in agriculture and requires strategies for the recovery of metal-polluted crop soils. The biorestoration of metal-polluted soils using technologies that combine plants and microorganisms has gained attention in recent decades due to the beneficial and synergistic effects produced by its biotic interactions. In this context, native and heavy metal-resistant plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) play a crucial role in the development of strategies for sustainable biorestoration of metal-contaminated soils. In this study, we present a genomic analysis and characterization of the rhizospheric bacterium Bacillus megaterium HgT21 isolated from metal-polluted soil from Zacatecas, Mexico.

35831844	10.1186/s12896-022-00750-w	Oleic acid based experimental evolution of Bacillus megaterium yielding an enhanced P450 BM3 variant.	Unlike most other P450 cytochrome monooxygenases, CYP102A1 from Bacillus megaterium (BM3) is both soluble and fused to its redox partner forming a single polypeptide chain. Like other monooxygenases, it can catalyze the insertion of oxygen unto the carbon-hydrogen bond which can result in a wide variety of commercially relevant products for pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. However, the instability of the enzyme holds back the implementation of a BM3-based biocatalytic industrial processes due to the important enzyme cost it would prompt. In this work, we sought to enhance BM3's total specific product output by using experimental evolution, an approach not yet reported to improve this enzyme. By exploiting B. megaterium's own oleic acid metabolism, we pressed the evolution of a new variant of BM3, harbouring 34 new amino acid substitutions.

Maltooligosaccharide-forming amylases (MFAs) hydrolyze starch into maltooligosaccharides with a defined degree of polymerization. However, the enzymatic mechanism underlying the product specificity remains partially understood. Here, we show that Saccharophagus degradans MFA (SdMFA) contains a noncatalytic starch-binding domain (SBD), which belongs to the carbohydrate-binding module family 20 and enables modulation of the product specificity. Removal of SBD from SdMFA resulted in a 3.5-fold lower production of the target maltopentaose. Conversely, appending SBD to another MFA from Bacillus megaterium improved the specificity for maltopentaose. SdMFA exhibited a higher level of exo-action and greater product specificity when reacting with amylopectin than with amylose.

35752665	10.1007/s11356-022-21299-3	The evaluation of Bacillus-secreted polyglutamic acid as anti-scaling treatment for circulating cooling water.	Polyaspartic acid is considered a green agent for the treatment of circulating cooling water. However, its chemosynthetic process is not green, as it requires significant amounts of energy and causes water pollution. In this work, we identified an analog of polyaspartic acid, namely polyglutamic acid (..-PGA), which could be directly produced by Bacillus spp., and we explored its performance and scale inhibition mechanism as a scale inhibitor. We found that ..-PGA secreted by B. megaterium with a molecular weight of...~...70..kDa showed poor scale inhibition, while the ..-PGA secreted by B. licheniformis with a molecular weight of...~...15..kDa had a 26.87% higher efficiency compared to commercially available polyaspartic acid. The scale inhibition mechanism was explored using the ..-PGA material secreted by B. licheniformis.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria have been shown to play important roles in maintaining host fitness under periods of abiotic stress, and yet their effect on mulberry trees which regularly suffer drought after flooding in the hydro-fluctuation belt of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region in China remains largely uncharacterized. In the present study, 74 bacterial isolates were obtained from the rhizosphere soil of mulberry after drought stress, including 12 phosphate-solubilizing and 10 indole-3-acetic-acid-producing isolates. Bacillus megaterium HGS7 was selected for further study due to the abundance of traits that might benefit plants. Genomic analysis revealed that strain HGS7 possessed multiple genes that contributed to plant growth promotion, stress tolerance enhancement, and antimicrobial compound production. B. megaterium HGS7 consistently exhibited antagonistic activity against phytopathogens and strong tolerance to abiotic stress in vitro.

In recent years, with the increasing number of patients with depression, the efficient synthesis of the first-line antidepressant drug duloxetine intermediate (S-N,N-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-3-(2-thienyl)-1-propanamine, S-DHTP) has attracted great attention. The wild-type AKR3-2-9 from Bacillus megaterium YC4-R4 exhibits high application potential of catalyzing N,N-dimethyl-3-keto-3-(2-thienyl)-1-propanamine (DKTP) to prepare S-DHTP, but there is still much room for improvement. In this work, rational design was carried out to enhance the catalytic potential of AKR3-2-9. Notably, compared to the wild-type AKR3-2-9, three mutants (Ile189Val, Asn256Asp, and Ile189Val + Asn256Asp) were obtained, and their catalytic efficiencies were increased by 1.3 times, 2.3 times, and 1.31 times, respectively. Besides, the thermal stability and organic solvent resistance were improved.

Tyrosinases, type-3 copper proteins responsible for melanin formation in various organisms, have considerable potential to produce bioactive catechol derivatives such as 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA). They catalyze the ortho-hydroxylation of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA via monophenolase activity and the subsequent oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone through diphenolase activity, which then spontaneously converts to melanin. In this study, six novel Bacillus megaterium strains, GJ802, GJ803, DY801, DY802, DY804, and DY805, were isolated from rice straw in South Korea. The tyrosinases of the novel strains were cloned, purified, and characterized. They exhibited catalytic activity over a broad pH range and showed high thermal stability. In addition, a tyrosinase of the B. megaterium DY805 strain (DY805), having the highest monophenolase activity among the tyrosinases, was used to produce L-DOPA as a biocatalyst.

A meta-analysis was carried out on published literature covering the topic of interactive plant microbiology for botanical species of legumes occurring within the boundary of the Italian island Sardinia, lying between the Tyrrhenian and the western Mediterranean seas. Reports were screened for the description of three types of bacterial occurrences; namely, (a) the nitrogen-fixing symbionts dwelling in root nodules; (b) other bacteria co-hosted in nodules but having the ancillary nature of endophytes; (c) other endophytes isolated from different non-nodular portions of the legume plants. For 105 plant species or subspecies, over a total of 290 valid taxonomical descriptions of bacteria belonging to either one or more of these three categories were found, yielding 85 taxa of symbionts, 142 taxa of endophytes in nodules, and 33 in other plant parts.

35684065	10.3390/nu14112265	Synbiotic Compositions of <i>Bacillus megaterium</i> and Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Salt Enable Self-Sufficient Production of Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators.	Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) have emerged as crucial lipid mediators that confer the inflammation-resolving effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). Importantly, SPM biosynthesis is dysfunctional in various conditions, which may explain the inconclusive efficacy data from n-3 PUFA interventions. To overcome the limitations of conventional n-3 PUFA supplementation strategies, we devised a composition enabling the self-sufficient production of SPM in vivo. Bacillus megaterium strains were fed highly bioavailable n-3 PUFA, followed by metabololipidomics analysis and bioinformatic assessment of the microbial genomes. All 48 tested Bacillus megaterium strains fed with the n-3 PUFA formulation produced a broad range of SPM and precursors thereof in a strain-specific manner, which may be explained by the CYP102A1 gene polymorphisms that we detected.

Proline plays a multifunctional role in several organisms including bacteria in conferring protection under stress conditions. In this paper we report the role of proline in conferring acid tolerance to Bacillus megaterium G18. An acid susceptible mutant of B. megaterium G18 which required proline for its growth under acid stress condition was generated through Tn5 mutagenesis. Further, targeted inactivation of proC involved in osmo-adaptive proline synthesis in B. megaterium G18 resulted in the loss of ability of the bacterium to grow at low pH (pH 4.5). Exogenous supply of proline (1..mM) to the growth medium restored the ability of the mutant cells to grow at pH 4.5 which was not the same in case of other osmoprotectants tested. Proline was produced and secreted to extracellular medium by B. megaterium G18 when growing in low pH condition as evidenced by the use of Escherichia coli proline auxotrophs and HPLC analysis.

Heterocycles consisting of a nitrogen atom, Indazole, is a pungent, biological, heterocyclic, bicyclic compound possessing electron-rich portions. Indazole is composed of two nitrogen atoms put under the azoles family, further called isoindazolone. It is colorless solid nitrogen- containing heterocyclics with atomic formula-C7H6N2 are extraordinary scaffolds, still identified as isoindazole. Therefore, analogs of Indazole have experienced expert approaches in later times because of its special biological properties, such as anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, anti- HIV and antihypertensive actions. 1H-indazole and 2H-indazole are two toutomeric forms of Indazole. Sometimes, indazole produces three tautomeric forms that are 1H, 2H and 3H tautomers of indazole. 1H-indazole is reliable than 2H-indazole.

Here, cell wall of a zygomycete fungus, Rhizopus delemar, grown on bread waste was wet spun into monofilaments. Using the whole cell wall material omits the common chitosan isolation and purification steps and leads to higher material utilization. The fungal cell wall contained 36.9% and 19.7% chitosan and chitin, respectively. Solid state NMR of the fungal cell wall material confirmed the presence of chitosan, chitin, and other carbohydrates. Hydrogels were prepared by ultrafine grinding of the cell wall, followed by addition of lactic acid to protonate the amino groups of chitosan, and subsequently wet spun into monofilaments. The monofilament inhibited the growth of Bacillus megaterium (Gram+..bacterium) and Escherichia coli (Gram- bacterium) significantly (92.2% and 99.7% respectively). Cytotoxicity was evaluated using an in vitro assay with human dermal fibroblasts, indicating no toxic inducement from exposure of the monofilaments.

The use of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) as a bioremediation enhancer in plant-assisted phytoremediation requires several steps, consisting of the screening, selection, and characterization of isolates. A subset of 50 bacterial isolates representing a wide phylogenetic range were selected from 438 morphologically different bacteria that were originally isolated from a petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC)-polluted site of a former petrochemical plant. Selected candidate bacteria were screened using six conventional plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits, complemented with the genetic characterization of genes involved in alkane degradation, as well as other pertinent functions. Finally, the bacterial isolates were subjected to plant growth promotion tests using a gnotobiotic approach under normal and stressed conditions.

Nitrate is the main nitrogen source for plant growth, but it can also pollute the environment. A major cause of soil secondary salinization is the rising level of nitrates in the soil, which poses a threat to the sustainability and fertility of global greenhouse soils. Herein, Bacillus megaterium NCT-2 was used as a microbial agent to remove nitrate by bioaugmentation, and the remediation efficiency of secondary salinized soil in different degrees was evaluated. The findings showed that the highest nitrate removal rate of 62.76% was in a medium degree of secondary salinized soil. Moreover, the results of 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that NCT-2 agent reduced the microbial diversity, increased the microbial community stability, and changed the composition and function of the microbial community were changed by NCT-2 agent in all districts soil.

The cytochrome P450 superfamily are heme-thiolate enzymes able to carry out monooxygenase reactions. Several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using a soluble bacterial reductase from Bacillus megaterium, BMR, as an artificial electron transfer partner fused to the human P450 domain in a single polypeptide chain in an approach known as 'molecular Lego'. The 3A4-BMR chimera has been deeply characterized biochemically for its activity, coupling efficiency, and flexibility by many different biophysical techniques leading to the conclusion that an extension of five glycines in the loop that connects the two domains improves all the catalytic parameters due to improved flexibility of the system. In this work, we extend the characterization of 3A4-BMR chimeras using differential scanning calorimetry to evaluate stabilizing role of BMR. We apply the 'molecular Lego' approach also to CYP19A1 (aromatase) and the data show that the activity of the chimeras is very low (&amp;lt;	2022	4	13	Int J Mol Sci	International journal of molecular sciences	3A4; BMR; aromatase; chimerization; flexibility; stability; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Heme; Humans; NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase; Recombinant Fusion Proteins	Catucci	Gianluca

Bisphenol compounds are emerging contaminants of high concerns with known endocrine-disrupting effects. Biocatalysis provides a green chemistry alternative for advanced treatment in water reclamation. This study createda novel biocatalyst through genetically immobilizing the Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase enzyme (BmTyr) on the surface ofself-assembled polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymer beads (termed PHA-BmTyr) by using synthetic biology techniques and demonstrated one-pot in vivo production of the biocatalyst for effective degradation and detoxification of various bisphenol analogues for the first time. The degradation pathway of bisphenols was determined to be mediated by the monophenolase and diphenolase activity of BmTyr. Notably, biocatalytic bisphenol degradation by PHA-BmTyr could substantially reduce or eliminate estrogenic activity of the contaminants, and the degradation products had remarkably lower acute and chronic toxicity than their parent compounds.

Inoculation of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) is a sustainable approach to increase the available P content in soils for crop production. This application, however, is constrained by the low survival rate of PSB in the field. Biochar, a carbon-rich biomaterial with a well-developed porous structure, has recently emerged as an appealing option to maintain the population size of inoculants in the soil. The efficacy of biochar as a PSB carrier is primarily determined by its physicochemical properties, which are dominated by the feedstocks and the pyrolysis temperatures. This study demonstrated a comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of straw-derived biochars prepared from different feedstocks (i.e., crop straws from cotton, peanut, maize, soybean, and wheat) and pyrolysis temperatures (i.e., 300 and 600 ..C).

The production of biodegradable and biocompatible materials such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) from waste-derived volatile fatty acids (VFAs) is a promising approach towards implementing a circular bioeconomy. However, VFA solutions obtained via acidification of organic wastes are usually too diluted for direct use in standard batch or fed-batch processes. To overcome these constraints, this study introduces a cell recycle fed-batch system using Bacillus megaterium uyuni S29 for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) production from acetic acid. The concentrations of dry cell weight (DCW), P3HB, acetate, as well as nitrogen as the limiting substrate component, were monitored during the process.

Cytochromes P450 have gained much interest for their broad substrate scope in the catalysis of oxidation reactions for pharmaceuticals, plastics, and hormones. However, achieving high coupling efficiency by the engineering of P450s is still a big challenge. The presence of extra water around the active site is deemed to be related to uncoupling. In this study, the access tunnels of P450 BM3 from Bacillus megaterium are engineered to control water access from bulk solvent to the active site. Nine residues located in tunnels are investigated by site-saturation mutagenesis to reduce water diffusion, thereby improving the coupling efficiency. The recombined variant N319L/T411V/T436A shows improved coupling efficiency (from 31.2...% to 52.6...%). Tunnel polarity analysis and molecular dynamics simulation further indicate that reduced water molecules around the active site lead to higher coupling efficiency. Overall, this study provides valuable insight on improving coupling efficiency by co	2022	5	9	ChemSusChem	ChemSusChem	biocatalysis; cytochrome P450; directed evolution; hydrophobicity; protein engineering; Bacillus megaterium; Bacterial Proteins; Catalytic Domain; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Oxidation-Reduction; Water	Meng	Shuaiqi
