15653875	10.1099/ijs.0.63310-0	Bacillus velezensis sp. nov., a surfactant-producing bacterium isolated from the river V..lez in M..laga, southern Spain.	Two Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterial strains, CR-502T and CR-14b, which produce surfactant molecules are described. Phenotypic tests and phylogenetic analyses showed these strains to be members of the genus Bacillus and related to the species Bacillus atrophaeus, Bacillus mojavensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus vallismortis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, although they differ from these species in a number of phenotypic characteristics. DNA-DNA hybridization confirmed that they show less than 20 % hybridization with the above-mentioned species and therefore represent a novel species of Bacillus. The DNA G+C content is 46.4 mol% in strain CR-502T and 46.1 mol% in strain CR-14b. The main fatty acids in strain CR-502T are 15 : 0 anteiso (32.70 %), 15 : 0 iso (29.86 %) and 16 : 0 (13.41 %). The main quinone in strain CR-502T is MK-7 (96.6 %). In the light of the polyphasic evidence gathered in this study, it is proposed that these strains be classified as a novel species of the g	2005	3	3	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Bacillus; Base Composition; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Phenotype; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rivers; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Spain; Surface-Active Agents	Ruiz-Garc..a	Cristina
18034237	10.1007/s00253-007-1212-5	Azoreductase and dye detoxification activities of Bacillus velezensis strain AB.	Azo dyes are known to be a very important and widely used class of toxic and carcinogenic compounds. Although lot of research has been carried out for their removal from industrial effluents, very little attention is given to changes in their toxicity and mutagenicity during the treatment processes. Present investigation describes isolation of a Bacillus velezensis culture capable of degrading azo dye Direct Red 28 (DR28). Azoreductase enzyme was isolated from it, and its molecular weight was found to be 60 kDa. The enzyme required NADH as cofactor and was oxygen-insensitive. Toxicity and mutagenicity of the dye during biodegradation was monitored by using a battery of carefully selected in vitro tests. The culture was found to degrade DR28 to benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl, both of which are potent mutagens. However, on longer incubation, both the compounds were degraded further, resulting in reduction in toxicity and mutagenicity of the dye. Thus, the culture seems to be a suitable ca	2008	5	7	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Aminobiphenyl Compounds; Azo Compounds; Bacillus; Benzidines; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Coenzymes; Coloring Agents; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Industrial Waste; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Mutation; NAD; NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases; Nitroreductases; Oxygen; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salmonella typhimurium	Bafana	Amit

The Bacillus subtilis group encompasses the taxa Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, B. licheniformis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. atrophaeus, B. mojavensis, B. vallismortis, B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii, B. sonorensis, B. velezensis, B. axarquiensis and B. malacitensis. In this study, the taxonomic relatedness between the species B. axarquiensis, B. malacitensis and B. mojavensis was investigated. Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the gene for DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) confirmed the very high similarities between these three type strains and a reference strain of B. mojavensis (&gt;99 and &gt;97 %, respectively). DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed high relatedness values between the type strains of B. axarquiensis, B. malacitensis and B. mojavensis and between these strains and a reference strain of B. mojavensis (83-98 %).

19111330	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.11.043	Bacterial reduction in genotoxicity of Direct Red 28 dye.	Direct Red 28 (DR28) is a benzidine-based azo dye widely used in several countries. It has also been a subject of intense research for its anti-prion activity. Like other benzidine-based azo dyes, it is also carcinogenic and toxic. However, there are very few studies addressing its detoxification. In the present study, a Bacillus velezensis strain was used for detoxification of DR28. Toxicity was checked by a battery of highly sensitive genotoxicity assays like comet assay, DNA ladder formation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and flow cytometric Annexin V binding assay. HL-60 cell line was used as the test system. All the assays showed an initial increase in toxicity upon biodegradation due to release of mutagenic products, like benzidine and 4-aminobiphenyl, from the dye. These intermediates caused significant DNA damage and induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Then the culture degraded these mutagenic intermediates, due to which the toxicity 	2009	4	24	Chemosphere	Chemosphere	Analysis of Variance; Annexin A5; Bacillus; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cell Line, Tumor; Comet Assay; Congo Red; DNA Fragmentation; Environmental Pollution; Flow Cytometry; Humans; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Mutagenicity Tests	Bafana	Amit

Strain BCRC 14193, isolated from soil, shared more than 99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with Bacillus amyloliquefaciens BCRC 11601(T) and Bacillus velezensis BCRC 17467(T). This strain was previously identified as B. amyloliquefaciens, based on DNA-DNA hybridization, but its DNA relatedness value with B. velezensis BCRC 17467(T) was 89 %. To investigate the relatedness of strain BCRC 14193, B. amyloliquefaciens and B. velezensis, the partial sequence of the gene encoding the subunit B protein of DNA gyrase (gyrB) was determined. B. velezensis BCRC 17467(T) shared high gyrB gene sequence similarity with B. amyloliquefaciens BCRC 14193 (98.4 %) and all of the B. amyloliquefaciens strains available (95.5-95.6 %). DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed high relatedness values between B. velezensis BCRC 17467(T) and B. amyloliquefaciens BCRC 11601(T) (74 %) and the B. amyloliquefaciens reference strains (74-89 %).

To construct a new recombinant strain of Bacillus velezensis that has antifungal and insecticidal activity via the expression of the insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein, a B. thuringiensis expression vector (pHT1K-1Ac) was generated that contained the B. thuringiensis cry1Ac gene under the control of its endogenous promoter in a minimal E. coli-B. thuringiensis shuttle vector (pHT1K). This vector was introduced into a B. velezensis isolate that showed high antifungal activities against several plant diseases, including rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), rice sheath blight (Rhizotonia solani), tomato gray mold (Botrytis cinerea), tomato late blight (Phytophthora infestans), and wheat leaf rust (Puccinia recondita), by electroporation. The recombinant B. velezensis strain was confirmed by PCR using cry1Ac-specific primers. Additionally, the recombinant strain produced a protein approximately 130 kDa in size and parasporal inclusion bodies similar to B. thuringiensis.

19494701	10.4014/jmb.0805.333	Biological control of strawberry Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae using Bacillus velezensis BS87 and RK1 formulation.	Two isolates, Bacillus sp. BS87 and RK1, selected from soil in strawberry fields in Korea, showed high levels of antagonism towards Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. fragariae in vitro. The isolates were identified as B. velezensis based on the homology of their gyrA sequences to reference strains. BS87 and RK1 were evaluated for control of Fusarium wilt in strawberries in pot trials and field trials conducted in Nonsan, Korea. In the pot trials, the optimum applied concentration of BS87 and RK1 for pre-plant root-dip application to control Fusarium wilt was 10(5) and 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml, respectively. Meanwhile, in the 2003 and 2005 field trials, the biological control efficacies of formulations of RK1 were similar to that of a conventional fungicide (copper hydroxide) when compared with a non-treated control. The RK1 formulation was also more effective than BS87 in suppressing Fusarium wilt under field conditions. Therefore, the results indicated that formulation of B.velezen	2009	10	19	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus; DNA Gyrase; Fragaria; Fusarium; Genes, Bacterial; Korea; Mycoses; Pest Control, Biological; Phylogeny; Plant Diseases	Nam	Myeong Hyeon

Marine microbes are a rich source of bioactive compounds, such as drugs, enzymes, and biosurfactants. To explore the bioactive compounds from our marine natural product library, an oil emulsification assay was applied to discover biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers. A spore-forming bacterial strain from sea mud was found to produce bioemulsifiers with good biosurfactant activity and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial properties. It was identified as Bacillus velezensis H3 using genomic and phenotypic data analysis. This strain was able to produce biosurfactants with an optimum emulsification activity at pH 6.0 and 2% NaCl by using starch as the carbon source and ammonium sulfate as the nitrogen source. The emulsification-guided isolation and purification procedure led to the discovery of the biosurfactant components, which were mainly composed of nC(14)-surfactin and anteisoC(15)-surfactin as determined by NMR and MS spectra. These compounds can reduce the surface tension of phosphate-buf	2010	10	14	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Ammonium Sulfate; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacillus; Cluster Analysis; Culture Media; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Emulsifying Agents; Geologic Sediments; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Structure; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Starch; Surface Tension; Surface-Active Agents	Liu	Xiangyang
23120987		[Geno- and phenotypic characteristic of Bacillus strains--components of endosporin].	Endosporin is used in veterinary for the prophylaxis and treatment of disbacteriosis, intestinal infections, festering wounds and postpartum pyoinflammatory complications in agricultural animals. The probiotic is based on two Bacillus strains which inhibit growth of a broad spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms and synthesise proteolytic enzymes and other biologically active secondary metabolites, particularly - polysaccharides. The activity of these two strains was supplementary. For the species identification of these strains, sequences of 16S rRNA genes and fatty acid content of cell walls were analysed. It was found that the both strains belong to B. velezensis. Limitations of application of 16S rRNA sequences for identification of closely related species are discussed in the paper. A method of 16S rRNA sequence profiling by polymorphic nucleotides was proposed. It was also shown that usefulness of Bacillus strains in probiotics is mostly based on their unique strain specific prope	2012	11	20	Mikrobiol Z	Mikrobiolohichnyi zhurnal (Kiev, Ukraine : 1993)	Antibiosis; Bacillus; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Pairing; Candida albicans; Culture Media, Conditioned; Escherichia coli; Fatty Acids; Inverted Repeat Sequences; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleotides; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Genetic; Probiotics; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Species Specificity; Staphylococcus aureus	Safronova	L A
22257263	10.1139/w11-113	Does the applicability of Bacillus strains in probiotics rely upon their taxonomy?	The taxonomic position and biological activities of two Bacillus strains used in veterinary probiotics were studied in this work. These microorganisms inhibit growth of a broad spectrum of pathogenic cultures. They synthesize proteolytic enzymes and other biologically active metabolites, and to some extent, supplement each other with probiotic activities. It is not clear whether these versatile activities are properties of individual strains or bacterial taxa as whole. 16S rRNA comparisons were conducted and illustrated the relatedness of these strains to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens . Their cell wall fatty acid contents were consequently analysed and specified a relation to the " Bacillus velezensis " ecomorph. On account of the previous observations, a simple method of 16S rRNA profiling by polymorphic nucleotides was proposed to determine a group of organisms closely related to "B. velezensis" and B...amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum, for they are biologically active strains suitabl	2012	7	18	Can J Microbiol	Canadian journal of microbiology	Animals; Bacillus; Lactobacillus casei; Phylogeny; Probiotics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S	Safronova	L A

However, to our knowledge this is the first report on the Bacillus species isolated from the rhizosphere of Calendula officinalis. 15..% of the isolated bacteria were screened for their important antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus niger, Cladosporium cucumerinium and Alternaria alternata. The bacteria identification based on 16S r-RNA and gyrase-A genes analysis, revealed strains closely related to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis, B. subtilis sub sp spizezenii and Paenibacillus polymyxa species. The electro-spray mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (ESI-LC MS) analysis showed that most of the Bacillus isolates produced the three lipopeptides families.

24006807		Characterization and flocculation properties of a carbohydrate bioflocculant from a newly isolated Bacillus velezensis 40B.	In this study, a bioflocculant with a high flocculation activity (&gt; 98%) produced by strain 40B, which was isolated from a brackish water was investigated By 16S rDNA sequence analysis, strain 40B was identified as Bacillus velezensis. Chemical analysis of the bioflocculant 40B indicated that it contained 2% protein and 98% carbohydrates. FTIR analysis showed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups, which were preferred for the flocculation process. The optimal concentration for the flocculation activity was 3.5 mg (-1). This polysaccharide could also flocculate kaolin suspension over a wide range of pH (1-10) and temperature (5-85 degrees C) in the presence of CaCl2. The stability of the bioflocculant 40B under various conditions suggests its possible use in the industries and environmental applications. However, no previous report exists on the isolation and characterization of a bioflocculant from the Bacillus velezensis.	2013	10	24	J Environ Biol	Journal of environmental biology	Bacillus; Carbohydrates; Chemical Precipitation; Egypt; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lakes; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salinity; Water Microbiology	Zaki	Sahar A
25079953	10.1007/s12275-014-4156-3	Enhanced Production of carboxymethylcellulase by a marine bacterium, Bacillus velezensis A-68, by using rice hulls in pilot-scale bioreactor under optimized conditions for dissolved oxygen.	The optimal conditions for the production of carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) by Bacillus velezensis A-68 at a flask scale have been previously reported. In this study, the parameters involved in dissolved oxygen in 7 and 100 L bioreactors were optimized for the pilot-scale production of CMCase. The optimal agitation speed and aeration rate for cell growth of B. velezensis A-68 were 323 rpm and 1.46 vvm in a 7 L bioreactor, whereas those for the production of CMCase were 380 rpm and 0.54 vvm, respectively. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) implied that the highly significant factor for cell growth was the aeration rate, whereas that for the production of CMCase was the agitation speed. The optimal inner pressures for cell growth and the production of CMCase by B. velezensis A-68 in a 100 L bioreactor were 0.00 and 0.04 MPa, respectively. The maximal production of CMCase in a 100 L bioreactor under optimized conditions using rice hulls was 108.1 U/ml, which was 1.8 times higher than that 	2015	10	9	J Microbiol	Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)	Aerobiosis; Aquatic Organisms; Bacillus; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Cellulase; Oryza; Oxygen	Gao	Wa

A collection of 200 bacterial isolates recovered from citrus plants (Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis, and Citrus reticulata), Medicago truncatula and Laurus nobilis, was established. In vitro screening indicated that 28 isolates exhibited an inhibitory activity against the vascular pathogens Phoma tracheiphila and Verticillium albo-atrum. Isolates were screened according to their hydrolytic activities, plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) abilities, as well as for the presence of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes responsible of the lipopeptide biosynthesis. The results were positive for 16 isolates which exhibited at least two PGPB activities and a single NRPS gene. Genetic diversity of the selected isolates was studied using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and repetitive element PCR (REP) tools that showed clustering of strains into three major groups (I, II, and III) (i, ii, and iii), respectively.

Biosurfactants are important in many areas; however, costs impede large-scale production. This work aimed to develop a global sustainable strategy for the production of biosurfactants by a novel strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Initially, Bacillus sp. strain 0G was renamed B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum (syn. Bacillus velezensis) after analysis of the gyrA and gyrB DNA sequences. Growth in modified Landy's medium produced 3 main recoverable metabolites: surfactin, fengycin, and acetoin, which promote plant growth. Cultivation was studied in the presence of renewable carbon (as glycerol) and nitrogen (as arginine) sources. While diverse kinetics of acetoin production were observed in different media, similar yields (6-8 g..L<sup>-1</sup>) were obtained after 72 h of growth.

30673446	10.1094/PDIS-04-17-0478-RE	Mixtures of Plant-Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria Enhance Biological Control of Multiple Plant Diseases and Plant-Growth Promotion in the Presence of Pathogens.	Several studies have shown that mixtures of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could enhance biological control activity for multiple plant diseases through the mechanisms of induced systemic resistance or antagonism. Prior experiments showed that four individual PGPR strains-AP69 (Bacillus altitudinis), AP197 (B. velezensis), AP199 (B. velezensis), and AP298 (B. velezensis)-had broad-spectrum biocontrol activity via antagonism in growth chambers against two foliar bacterial pathogens (Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato) and one of two tested soilborne fungal pathogens (Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium ultimum). Based on these findings, the overall hypothesis of this study was that a mixture of two individual PGPR strains would exhibit better overall biocontrol and plant-growth promotion than the individual PGPR strains. Two separate greenhouse experiments were conducted. In each experiment, two individual PGPR strains and their mixtures w	2019	2	13	Plant Dis	Plant disease	Bacillus; Biological Control Agents; Capsicum; Cucumis sativus; Lycopersicon esculentum; Pest Control, Biological; Plant Diseases; Pseudomonas syringae; Pythium; Rhizoctonia; Xanthomonas axonopodis	Liu	Ke

In this work, the behavior in tomato rhizosphere of Bacillus velezensis FZB42 was analyzed taking into account the surfactin production, the use of tomato roots exudate as substrates, and the biofilm formation. B. velezensis FZB42 and B. amyloliquefaciens S499 have a similar capability to colonize tomato rhizosphere. Little difference in this colonization was observed with surfactin non producing B. velezensis FZB42 mutant strains. B. velezensis is able to grow in the presence of root exudate and used preferentially sucrose, maltose, glutamic, and malic acids as carbon sources. A mutant enable to produce exopolysaccharide (EPS<sup>-</sup>) was constructed to demonstrate the main importance of biofilm formation on rhizosphere colonization. This mutant had completely lost its ability to form biofilm whatever the substrate present in the culture medium and was unable to efficiently colonize tomato rhizosphere.	2019	1	14	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Environmental science and pollution research international	Bacillus; Biofilm; Colonization; Lipopeptides; Rhizosphere; Root exudates; Bacillus; Biofilms; Lycopersicon esculentum; Plant Roots; Rhizosphere; Soil Microbiology	Al-Ali	Ameen

30622550	10.3389/fpls.2018.01904	<i>Bacillus velezensis</i> YC7010 Enhances Plant Defenses Against Brown Planthopper Through Transcriptomic and Metabolic Changes in Rice.	Brown planthopper (BPH; Nilaparvata lugens St..l) is one of the most serious insect pests, which reduce rice yield remarkably in many rice-growing areas. A few plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria induce systemic resistance against herbivorous insects. Here we show that root drenching of rice seedlings with an endophytic strain Bacillus velezensis YC7010 enhanced defenses against BPH. Based on high-throughput transcriptome analysis, systemic resistance against BPH was induced by B. velezensis YC7010 via salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent pathways. Increased leaf contents of secondary metabolites, tricin and C-glycosyl flavone and cell-wall contents of lignin and cellulose were the key defense mechanisms inducing resistance against BPH during the three-way interaction. This study shows for the first time that chemical changes and strengthening of physical barriers play important roles simultaneously in plant defense against BPH in rice by t	2020	10	1	Front Plant Sci	Frontiers in plant science	Bacillus velezensis YC7010; brown planthopper; induce systemic resistance; rice; secondary metabolites	Harun-Or-Rashid	Md

30535579	10.1007/s00253-018-9459-6	Heavy water-labeled Raman spectroscopy reveals carboxymethylcellulose-degrading bacteria and degradation activity at the single-cell level.	Biodegradation of cellulose-rich substrates is an indispensable process for soil carbon replenishment in various ecological niches. Biodegradation of cellulose has been studied extensively via an enzyme assay to quantify the amount of cellulase with a view to identify effective cellulose degraders. However, a bulk enzyme assay undermines the role of physiological heterogeneity between cells; it is therefore imperative to opt out for a more effective method such as single-cell Raman spectroscopy combined with heavy water (D2O) to reveal active cellulose degraders. Cellular incorporation of D2O-derived D produces a new C-D Raman band which can act as a quantitative indicator of microbial activity. In this study, metabolic responses of seven cellulose-degrading bacteria to carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and glucose were evaluated via the C-D Raman band. On the basis of % C-D, CMC was demonstrated to be most efficiently metabolized by Bacillus velezensis 2a-9 and Provid	2019	5	30	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Cellulose biodegradation; Heavy water isotope labeling; Heterogeneous degradation activity; Raman spectroscopy; Single-cell microbiology; Bacillus; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium; Cellulase; Deuterium Oxide; Glucose; Isotope Labeling; Providencia; Soil Microbiology; Spectrum Analysis, Raman	Olaniyi	Oladipo Oladiti

Bacillus velezensis FZB42, the model strain for Gram-positive plant-growth-promoting and biocontrol rhizobacteria, has been isolated in 1998 and sequenced in 2007. In order to celebrate these anniversaries, we summarize here the recent knowledge about FZB42. In last 20 years, more than 140 articles devoted to FZB42 have been published. At first, research was mainly focused on antimicrobial compounds, apparently responsible for biocontrol effects against plant pathogens, recent research is increasingly directed to expression of genes involved in bacteria-plant interaction, regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs), and on modification of enzymes involved in synthesis of antimicrobial compounds by processes such as acetylation and malonylation. Till now, 13 gene clusters involved in non-ribosomal and ribosomal synthesis of secondary metabolites with putative antimicrobial action have been identified within the genome of FZB42.

Although it is generally considered tolerant to different diseases, it is quite susceptible to the fungus Plenodomus destruens that causes foot-rot disease. Plant growth-promoting bacteria associated with sweet potato remain poorly studied, but some Bacillus strains may have potential as biological control agents. Here, we evaluate the persistence of two bacterial strains-Bacillus safensis T052-76 and Bacillus velezensis T149-19-in pot experiments and assess their impact on indigenous bacterial and fungal communities associated with sweet potato. Numbers of cells of both strains introduced into pots remained stable in the rhizosphere of sweet potato over the 180-day experiment.

Bacillus subtilis is well known as both a model organism and as a microbial cell factory. Simple and scarless gene modification is a desirable tool for basic research and industrial applications of B. subtilis. It has been demonstrated that naturally competent strains of B. subtilis can uptake multiple different DNA molecules, a phenomenon called co-transformation. Here, we describe a co-transformation-based method for generating unmarked mutants of B. subtilis. The PCR product containing the desired mutant allele is introduced into B. subtilis through co-transformation of the plasmid pUS20, which harbours a spectinomycin-resistant marker (Spc<sup>r</sup>). The target mutation is acquired by screening transformants for integration of pUS20 by resistance to spectinomycin. Due to its unstable replication in B. subtilis, pUS20 is easily cured from transformants in the absence of spectinomycin.

This allows a proposal of species-specific epidemiological cutoff values (ECOFFs) for the interpretation of antimicrobial resistance in these species. MICs determined by the modified CLSI method were 2- to 16-fold higher than with the CLSI-recommended method for several antimicrobials. The MIC distributions differed between species for five of the nine antimicrobials.

29927357	10.1094/PHYTO-02-18-0048-R	Enhanced Control of Plant Wilt Disease by a Xylose-Inducible degQ Gene Engineered into Bacillus velezensis Strain SQR9XYQ.	Bacillus velezensis SQR9 (former B. amyloliquefaciens SQR9) is a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) that promotes plant growth and health. The colonization of PGPR strains along plant roots is a prerequisite for them to execute their specific functions. However, one problem of microbial introduction in practice is that the applied PGPR strains do not always successfully colonize the rhizosphere. In Bacillus spp., two-component signal transduction system (TCS) DegS/U regulates flagellar motility, biofilm formation and antibiotic production. Phosphorylation of DegU by DegS is positively affected by DegQ protein. In this study, we constructed a xylose-inducible degQ genetically engineered strain SQR9XYQ to improve the biocontrol activity. The results from in vitro, root in situ, greenhouse experiments and RT-qPCR studies demonstrate that (i) the phosphorylation of DegU in SQR9XYQ can be gradually activated by xylose, which is a component of both cucumber and tomato root exudates	2019	8	12	Phytopathology	Phytopathology	Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Biological Control Agents; Curcuma; Genes, Bacterial; Lycopersicon esculentum; Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified; Phosphorylation; Plant Diseases; Plant Roots; Signal Transduction; Xylose	Xu	Zhihui

To develop an effective biological agent to control Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, three endophytic Bacillus spp. strains with high antagonistic activity were isolated from maize seed and characterized. In vitro assays revealed that the Bacillus endophytes could produce volatile organic compounds (VOC) that reduced sclerotial production and inhibited mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the selected strains produced 16 detectable VOC. Eight of the produced VOC exhibited negative effects on S. sclerotiorum, while a further four induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in mycelial cells. A mixture of VOC produced by Bacillus velezensis VM11 caused morphological changes in the ultrastructure and organelle membranes of S. sclerotiorum mycelial cells. The bromophenol blue assay revealed a yellow color of untreated fungal mycelium, which grew faster and deeper from 24 to 72 h postinoculation, as an indication of reduced pH.

29900507	10.1007/s11274-018-2479-7	A look into a multifunctional toolbox: endophytic Bacillus species provide broad and underexploited benefits for plants.	One of the major challenges of agriculture currently is to obtain higher crop yield. Environmental conditions, cultivar quality, and plant diseases greatly affect plant productivity. On the other hand, several endophytic Bacillus species have emerged as a complementary, efficient, and safe alternative to current crop management practices. The ability of Bacillus species to form spores, which resist adverse conditions, is an advantage of the genus for use in formulations. Endophytic Bacillus species provide plants with a wide range of benefits, including protection against phytopathogenic microorganisms, insects, and nematodes, eliciting resistance, and promoting plant growth, without causing damage to the environment. Bacillus thuringiensis, B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. velezensis, B. cereus, B. pumilus, and B. licheniformis are the most studied Bacillus species for application in agriculture, although other species within the genus have also shown great potential.

Genomes of 24 sequenced Bacillus velezensis strains were characterized to identity shared and unique genes of lignocellulolytic enzymes and predict potential to degrade lignocellulose. All 24 strains had genes that encoded lignocellulolytic enzymes, with potential to degrade cellulose and hemicelluloses. Several lignocellulosic genes related to cellulose degradation were universally present, including one GH5 (endo-1,4-..-glucanase), one GH30 (glucan endo-1,6-..-glucosidase), two GH4 (6-phospho-..-glucosidase, 6-phospho-..-glucosidase), one GH1 (6-phospho-..-galactosidase), one GH16 (..-glucanase) and three GH32 (two sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase and levanase). However, in the absence of gene(s) for cellobiohydrolase, it was predicted that none of the 24 strains would be able to directly hydrolyse cellulose.

32416818	10.3382/ps/pez496	A novel Bacillus based multi-strain probiotic improves growth performance and intestinal properties of Clostridium perfringens challenged broilers.	There is a necessity for the implementation of in-feed probiotics in the poultry production industry, following strict regulations around the use of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). Bacillus spp. are becoming an attractive alternative because of their functionality and stability. This study aims to evaluate the effect of a novel multi-strain Bacillus based probiotic on growth performance and gut health in male Ross 308 broiler chickens challenged with Clostridium perfringens Type A. Broilers on a 4 phase feeding program were fed diets containing either a standard metabolizable energy (ME) (100%) or a reduced ME (98%) level. The test probiotic was compared to an un-supplemented negative control and a commercial benchmark product as positive control over a 35 D feeding trial, using a 2 .. 3 factorial experimental design. Chicks were inoculated with a once-off dose of C. perfringens on day 14. Growth performance was measured weekly to calculate body weight (BW), feed intake (FI) and fee	2020	12	14	Poult Sci	Poultry science	Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus velezensis; broiler; probiotic; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Bacillus; Body Weight; Chickens; Clostridium Infections; Clostridium perfringens; Diet; Gastrointestinal Tract; Male; Probiotics	Ramlucken	Uraisha

Clubroot disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae can lead to serious yield losses in crucifers such as Brassica napus. In this study, 323 bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of severely diseased B. napus in Dangyang county, Hubei province, China. Antagonistic strains were first identified based on dual culture inhibition zones with Fusarium oxysporum and Magnaporthe oryzae. These were then further screened in germination inhibition and viability assays of resting spores of P. brassicae. Finally, eight of the antagonistic strains were found to significantly reduce the disease severity of clubroot by more than 40% under greenhouse conditions, and two strains, F85 and T113, were found to have efficacy of more than 80%. Root hair infection experiments showed that F85 and T113 can inhibit early infection of root hairs, reduce the differentiation of primary plasmodia of P. brassicae, and inhibit formation of secondary zoosp	2020	9	28	Front Microbiol	Frontiers in microbiology	Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bacillus velezensism; Plasmodiophora brassicae; biocontrol; rapeseed	Zhu	Manli

Bacillus velezensis is a novel species of Bacillus that has been widely investigated and used because of its direct or indirect growth improvement effect for many plants. B. velezensis FKM10 was previously isolated from rhizosphere soil of apple trees and shows potential as a plant growth-promoting and biocontrol bacterium. In this study, strain FKM10 was verified to inhibit some fungal pathogens of soil-borne plant diseases, produce siderophores to absorb ferric iron for plants, and degrade proteins. Pot experiments showed that the application of strain FKM10 could directly promote the growth of Malus hupehensis Rehd. by increasing biomass, promoting the absorption of nutrients, improving soil fertility, changing the soil microbial community structure, and reducing fungal diversity. The results of this study provided a basis for using strain FKM10 to improve crop yield and overcome diseases of plants.

Chemotaxis towards root exudates and subsequent biofilm formation are very important for root colonization and for providing the beneficial functions of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs). In this study, in comparison with other root-secreted compounds, D-galactose in the root exudates of cucumber was found to be a strong chemoattractant at the concentration of 1....M for Bacillus velezensis SQR9. Chemotaxis assays with methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) deletion strains demonstrated that McpA was solely responsible for chemotaxis towards D-galactose. Interestingly, D-galactose significantly enhanced the biofilm formation of SQR9 in an McpA-dependent manner. Further experiment showed that D-galactose also enhanced root colonization by SQR9. In addition, the secretion of D-galactose by cucumber roots could be induced by inoculation with SQR9, indicating that D-galactose may be an important signal in the interaction between plant and SQR9.

Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana) fruit has gained recognition owing to its nutritional value and versatility to be consumed processed or as a fresh product. These characteristics have made it an important product in both national and international markets. One of the main limitations for this crop is Fusarium wilt caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. physalis, for which biological control is emerging as an alternative to conventional management with chemical synthesis products. However, information on the effect that biological control agents have on the growth and development of plants is scarce.

Bacillus spp. produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, including antibiotics, which have been well studied for their antibacterial properties but less so as signaling molecules. Previous results indicated that the lipopeptide bacillomycin D is a signal that promotes biofilm development of Bacillus velezensis SQR9. However, the mechanism behind this signaling is still unknown. Here, we show that bacillomycin D promotes biofilm development by promoting the acquisition of iron. Bacillomycin D promotes the transcription of the iron ABC transporter FeuABC by binding to its transcription factor, Btr. These actions increase intracellular iron concentration and activate the KinB-Spo0A-SinI-SinR-dependent synthesis of biofilm matrix components. We demonstrate that this strategy is beneficial for biofilm development and competition with the Pseudomonas fluorescens PF-5.

31219564	10.1093/database/baz071	AmyloWiki: an integrated database for Bacillus velezensis FZB42, the model strain for plant growth-promoting Bacilli.	Since its isolation 20..years ago, many studies have been devoted to Bacillus velezensis FZB42 (former name Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum FZB42), which has been gradually accepted as a model organism for Gram-positive rhizobacteria. FZB42 is different from another widely studied bacterial strain, Bacillus subtilis 168, in its many features that are closely associated with plants. FZB42 represents a large group of Bacillus isolates that are beneficial to plants and of great importance in agriculture. In this work a database for FZB42 named 'AmyloWiki' is built to integrate all information of FZB42 available to date. The information includes the genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, post-translational data as well as FZB42 unique genes, protein regulators, mutant availability, publications and etc. The website is built up with PHP and MySQL with a function of keyword searching, browsing, data-downloading and other functions.	2020	1	8	Database (Oxford)	Database : the journal of biological databases and curation	Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Databases, Genetic; Plants; Proteomics; Transcriptome	Fan	Ben

Yaks living in the high-altitude hypoxic environment of Tibetan plateau (3600..m) have special gut microbes. However, it is still little research on yak probiotics until now. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the growth promoting effect, antioxidant capability, immune effect, and anti-inflammatory ability of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus velezensis isolated from Tibetan yaks in mice model. The results showed that the isolated strains supplementation not only improve the growth performance but also increased the length of villus in the small intestine and intestinal digestive enzyme activity. Importantly, we observed that the T-AOC, SOD, and GSH-PX levels were increased and the MDA content was reduced in probiotic-treated mice, which implied that probiotics supplementation can ameliorate the antioxidative activity of mice. The levels of AST and ALT correlated with the hepatic injury were reduced and the levels of AKP, TP, GLB, ALB, Ca, and P were markedly higher than 	2019	10	17	Microb Cell Fact	Microbial cell factories	Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus velezensis; Digestive enzyme activity; Immunity; Yaks; Animals; Bacillus; Bacillus subtilis; Cattle; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Immunity; Inflammation; Intestines; Male; Mice; Probiotics	Li	Aoyun

31106958	10.1111/1462-2920.14683	A genomic island in a plant beneficial rhizobacterium encodes novel antimicrobial fatty acids and a self-protection shield to enhance its competition.	Rhizobacteria devote a relatively large percentage of their genomes to encode bioactive natural products that are important for competition in the rhizosphere. In this study, a plant beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis SQR9 was discovered to produce novel antibacterial fatty acids, Bacillunoic acids, which are encoded on a genomic island (GI). This GI contains a hybrid type I fatty acid synthase (FAS)-polyketide synthase (PKS) system and an ABC transporter. The FAS was predicted to synthesize a primer that was transferred to the PKS to synthesize Bacillunoic acids. The synthesized Bacillunoic acids inhibit the growth of diverse bacteria, with the strongest activity against closely related Bacillus strains, the ABC transporter exported the toxic Bacillunoic acids upon their induction for protecting the producing strain.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are increasingly used in crops worldwide. While selected PGPR strains can reproducibly promote plant growth under controlled greenhouse conditions, their efficacy in the field is often more variable. Our overall aim was to determine if pectin or orange peel (OP) amendments to Bacillus velezensis (Bv) PGPR strains could increase soybean growth and nodulation by Bradyrhizobium japonicum in greenhouse and field experiments to reduce variability. The treatments included untreated soybean seeds planted in field soil that contained Bv PGPR strains and non-inoculated controls with and without 0.1% (w/v) pectin or (1 or 10 mg/200 ..L) orange peel (OP) amendment. In greenhouse and field tests, 35 and 55 days after planting (DAP), the plants were removed from pots, washed, and analyzed for treatment effects.

In this study, we identified an efficient PGPR strain B. velezensis F21, which could be used in watermelon production for Fon control. The results of biocontrol mechanisms showed that B. velezensis F21 could suppress the growth and spore germination of Fon in vitro. Moreover, B. velezensis F21 could also enhance plant basal immunity to Fon by increasing the expression of plant defense related genes and activities of some defense enzymes, such as CAT, POD, and SOD.

The gene encoding an ..-L-arabinofuranosidase (BvAF) GH51 from Bacillus velezensis FZB42 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The corresponding open reading frame consists of 1,491 nucleotides which encode 496 amino acids with the molecular mass of 56.9 kDa. BvAF showed the highest activity against sugar beet (branched) arabinan in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) at 45..C. However, it could hardly hydrolyze debranched arabinan and arabinoxylans. The time-course hydrolyses of branched arabinan and arabinooligosaccharides (AOS) revealed that BvAF is a unique exo-hydrolase producing exclusively L-arabinose. BvAF could cleave ..-(1,2)- and/or ..-(1,3)-L-arabinofuranosidic linkages of the branched substrates to produce the debranched forms of arabinan and AOS. Although the excessive amount of BvAF could liberate L-arabinose from linear AOS, it was extremely lower than that on branched AOS.

Surfactin is one of the most widely studied biosurfactants due to its many potential applications in different fields. In the present study, Bacillus velezensis BS-37, initially identified as a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was used to efficiently produce surfactin with the addition of glycerol, an inexpensive by-product of biodiesel production. After 36..hr of growth in glycerol medium, the total surfactin concentration reached more than 1,000..mg/L, which was two times higher than that in sucrose medium. Moreover, the addition of l- and d-Leu to the culture medium had opposite effects on surfactin production by BS-37. While surfactin production increased significantly to nearly 2,000..mg/L with the addition of 10..mM l-Leu, it was dramatically reduced to about 250..mg/L with the addition of 10..mM d-Leu.

Bacillus velezensis is an endospore-forming, free-living soil bacterium with potential as a biopesticide against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens of plants. Its potential for commercial development is enhanced by rapid replication and resistance to adverse environmental conditions, typical of Bacillus species. However, the use of beneficial microbes against phytopathogens has not gained dominance due to limitations that may be overcome with new biopesticidal strains and/or new biological knowledge. Here, we isolated B. velezensis strain 9D-6 and showed that it inhibits the in vitro growth of prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, including the bacteria Bacillus cereus , Clavibacter michiganensis, Pantoea agglomerans, Ralstonia solanacearum, Xanthomonas campestris, and Xanthomonas euvesicatoria; and the fungi Alternaria solani, Cochliobolus carbonum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Gibberella pulicaris, Gibberella zeae, Monilinia fructicola, Pyrenochaeta terrestris and Rhizoc	2019	9	23	BMC Microbiol	BMC microbiology	Antibacterial; Antifungal; Genome sequencing; Induced systemic resistance (ISR); Plant-microbe interactions; Secondary metabolites; Anti-Infective Agents; Bacillus; Bacteria; Fungi; Genome, Bacterial; Lipopeptides; Microbial Interactions; Peptides, Cyclic	Grady	Elliot Nicholas

Thus, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the root colonization process by plant-beneficial Bacillus strains is essential for the use of these strains in agriculture. Here, we observed that an sfp gene mutant of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis SQR9 was unable to form normal biofilm architecture, and differential protein expression was observed by proteomic analysis. A minor wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthetic protein, GgaA, was decreased over 4-fold in the ..sfp mutant, and impairment of the ggaA gene postponed biofilm formation and decreased cucumber root colonization capabilities.

This is a highly multifactorial process since root exudates are complex compound mixtures of which components are recognized by different chemoreceptors. Little information is available as to the key components in root exudates and their receptors that drive colonization related chemotaxis. We present here the first global assessment of this issue using the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) Bacillus velezensis SQR9 (formerly B. amyloliquefaciens). This strain efficiently colonizes cucumber roots, and here, we show that chemotaxis to cucumber root exudates was essential in this process.

Molasses is a wildly used feedstock for fermentation, but it also poses a severe wastewater-disposal problem worldwide. Recently, the wastewater from yeast molasses fermentation is being processed into fulvic acid (FA) powder as a fertilizer for crops, but it consequently induces a problem of soil acidification after being directly applied into soil. In this study, the low-cost FA powder was bioconverted into a value-added product of ..-PGA by a glutamate-independent producer of Bacillus velezensis GJ11. FA power could partially substitute the high-cost substrates such as sodium glutamate and citrate sodium for producing ..-PGA.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are associated with plant roots and use organic compounds that are secreted from root exudates as food and energy source. Root exudates can chemoattract and help bacteria to colonize the surface of plant roots by inducing chemotactic responses of rhizospheric bacteria. In this study, we show that root colonization of Brachypodium distachyon by Bacillus velezensis strain B26 depends on several factors. These include root exudates, organic acids, and their biosynthetic genes, chemotaxis, biofilm formation and the induction of biofilm encoding genes. Analysis of root exudates by GC-MS identified five intermediates of the TCA cycle; malic, fumaric, citric, succinic, oxaloacetic acids, and were subsequently evaluated.

33048960	10.1371/journal.pone.0239971	Culture-dependent and -independent investigations of bacterial migration into doenjang from its components meju and solar salt.	We determined bacterial migration into doenjang from its components, meju and solar salt using culture-based and 16S rRNA gene-based culture-independent techniques (pyrosequencing of total DNA). Pyrosequencing results suggested that the bacterial communities of meju, but not solar salt, significantly affected those of doenjang communities. Culture-based pyrosequencing analysis yielded similar results. These results indicate that most predominant bacterial species in doenjang migrated from meju, not solar salt. We therefore believe that the present study is one of the most comprehensive comparisons of bacterial communities of fermented soybeans using culture-dependent and -independent methods.

33048404	10.1111/jam.14893	Probiotic supplementation containing Bacillus velezensis enhances expression of immune regulatory genes against pigeon circovirus in pigeons (Columba livia).	In this study, we aimed to isolate and evaluate the efficacy of Bacillus velezensis as a probiotic and to assess its activity towards pigeons infected with pigeon circovirus (PiCV). Bacillus velezensis, isolated from pigeon faeces, was orally administered to pigeons for 60..days. After pigeons were challenged with PiCV, the PiCV viral load and expression of indicator genes for innate immunity were detected in spleen tissue and faeces of pigeons. Bacillus velezensis significantly reduced the PiCV viral load in the faeces and spleen of pigeons 5..days post-challenge (dpc). The mRNA expression levels of treated pigeons showed that interferon-gamma (IFN-..), myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), and signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) genes were upregulated, whereas no expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4) was detected. Moreover, toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) were significantly upregulated in probiotic-treated pigeons (P..&lt;..0..05).

Several quorum sensing systems occurring in Bacillus subtilis, e.g. Rap-Phr systems, were reported to interact with major regulatory proteins, such as ComA, DegU, and Spo0A, in order to regulate competence, sporulation, and synthesis of secondary metabolites. In this study, we characterized a novel Rap-Phr system, RapA4-PhrA4, in Bacillus velezensis NAU-B3. We found that the rapA4 and phrA4 genes were co-transcribed in NAU-B3. When rapA4 was expressed in the heterologous host Bacillus subtilis OKB105, surfactin production and sporulation were severely inhibited. However, when the phrA4 was co-expressed, the RapA4 activity was inhibited. The transcription of the surfactin synthetase srfA gene and sporulation-related genes were also regulated by the RapA4-PhrA4 system. In vitro results obtained from electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) proved that RapA4 inhibits ComA binding to the promoter of the srfA operon, and the PhrA4 pentapeptide acts as anti-activator of RapA4.

In vitro, strain XT1 showed to reduce fungal mycelium from 34 to 100%, depending on if the assay was conducted with the supernatant, volatile compounds, lipopeptides or whole bacterial culture. In preventive treatments, when applied directly on young olive trees, it reduced Verticillium incidence rate and percentage of severity by 54 and ~80%, respectively. It increased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity by 395%, indicating an enhancement of disease resistance in plant tissues, and it decreased by 20.2% the number of fungal microsclerotia in soil.

The application of biocontrol biopesticides based on plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), particularly members of the genus Bacillus, is considered a promising perspective to make agricultural practices sustainable and ecologically safe. Recent advances in genome sequencing by third-generation sequencing technologies, e.g., Pacific Biosciences' Single Molecule Real-Time (PacBio SMRT) platform, have allowed researchers to gain deeper insights into the molecular and genetic mechanisms of PGPR activities, and to compare whole genome sequences and global patterns of epigenetic modifications. In the current work, this approach was used to sequence and compare four Bacillus strains that exhibited various PGPR activities including the strain UCMB5140, which is used in the commercial biopesticide Phytosubtil.

Root colonization of beneficial rhizobacteria is critical for their beneficial effects. Quorum sensing (QS) has been reported to affect the colonization of many plant pathogens. However, how QS signals regulate root colonization of beneficial rhizobacteria is unclear. In this study, the QS signal AI-2 synthetase-encoding gene luxS was completely deleted from the genome of the plant beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis SQR9, and bioluminescence experiments showed that AI-2 production was blocked. Deletion of luxS reduced biofilm formation, motility, and root colonization of B. velezensis SQR9, while addition of exogenous AI-2 to the mutant restored this phenomenon. These results indicated that AI-2 positively affects the root colonization of B. velezensis SQR9. This study provided new insights for enhancing the colonization of beneficial rhizobacteria.

In the last few years, the alarming spread of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, the causal agent of ash dieback, has resulted in a substantial threat to native ash stands in central and northern Europe. Since leaves and leaf petioles are the primary infection sites, phyllosphere microorganisms are presumed to interact with the pathogen and are discussed as a source of biocontrol agents. We studied compound leaves from susceptible and visible infection-free trees in four ash stands with a high likelihood of infection to assess a possible variation in the bacterial microbiota, depending on the health status of the trees. The bacterial community was analyzed by culture-independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and through the isolation and taxonomic classification of 2,589 isolates using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

Thus, this research work was initiated to mitigate the impact of the disease using Bacillus velezensis AR1. A total of four treatments, A. sesami alone, sole fungicide, AR1, and alternate application of AR1 with dithianon (fungicide) were applied with six replications. The results indicate that the sole and alternate application of AR1 with fungicide reduced disease severity to less than 10%. Plant physiological traits also improved due to the plant growth promoting AR1. Induced plant defense-related biochemicals, i.e. total phenolic and flavonoid contents, were maximum in the plant subjected to AR1 and alternate application with a fungicide.

32397545	10.3390/microorganisms8050697	Screening, Identification and Efficacy Evaluation of Antagonistic Bacteria for Biocontrol of Soft Rot Disease Caused by <i>Dickeya zeae</i>.	Dickeya zeae is the causal agent of bacterial soft rot disease, with a wide range of hosts all over the world. At present, chemical agents, especially agricultural antibiotics, are commonly used in the prevention and control of bacterial soft rot, causing the emergence of resistant pathogens and therefore increasing the difficulty of disease prevention and control. This study aims to provide a safer and more effective biocontrol method for soft rot disease caused by D. zeae. The spot-on-lawn assay was used to screen antagonistic bacteria, and three strains including SC3, SC11 and 3-10 revealed strong antagonistic effects and were identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. parafulva and Bacillus velezensis, respectively, using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on the sequences of 16S rRNA and other housekeeping genes.

Inoculation of crop plants with strains of beneficial bacteria can result in promotion of plant growth. In our study, we demonstrated that Bacillus velezensis WRN031 as a plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) improved the maize seedling growth following inoculation with WRN031. Fluorescence microscopy visualization indicated that GFP-labeled B. velezensis WRN031 had accumulated on the maturation zones of both primary and lateral roots of maize. Two metabolites were detected in the rhizosphere soil of maize root inoculation with WRN031 using HPLC-DAD analyses. Through guided isolation from an ethyl acetate extract of B. velezensis WRN031, these two nonvolatile meso stereoisomers 3S,4R-acetylbutanediol (3S,4R-ABD, 1) and 3R,4R-acetylbutanediol (3R,4R-ABD, 2) were identified and found to occur at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) in maize rhizosphere soil.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the PGPR effect on nodulation and nitrogen-fixing efficiency of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) by co-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110. Co-inoculation of Bacillus velezensis S141 with USDA110 into soybean resulted in enhanced nodulation and N2-fixing efficiency by producing larger nodules. To understand the role of S141 on soybean and USDA110 symbiosis, putative genes related to IAA biosynthesis were disrupted, suggesting that co-inoculation of USDA110 with S141..yhcX reduces the number of large size nodules. It was revealed that yhcX may play a major role in IAA biosynthesis in S141 as well as provide a major impact on soybean growth promotion. The disruption of genes related to cytokinin biosynthesis and co-inoculation of USDA110 with S141..IPI reduced the number of very large size nodules, and it appears that IPI might play an important role in nodule size of	2020	9	28	Microorganisms	Microorganisms	Bradyrhizobium; Co-inoculation; Nodulation; PGPR; Soybean	Sibponkrung	Surachat
32386333	10.1111/ppl.13120	Protecting tobacco plants from O<sub>3</sub> injury by Bacillus velezensis with production of acetoin.	Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) confer benefits to crops by producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to trigger induced systemic tolerance (IST). Here we show that Bacillus velezensis GJ11, a kind of PGPRs, produce VOCs such as 2,3-butanediol and acetoin to trigger IST and cause stomatal closure against O3 injury in tobacco plants. Compared to 2,3-butanediol, acetoin was more effective on triggering IST against O3 injury. The bdh-knockout strain GJ11..bdh with a blocked metabolic pathway from acetoin to 2,3-butanediol produced more acetoin triggering stronger IST against O3 injury than GJ11. Both acetoin and GJ11..bdh effectively enhance the antioxidant enzymes activity (e.g. superoxide dismutase and catalases) that is favorable for scavenging the reactive oxygen species like H2 O2 in leaves after exposure to O3 .

Nicosulfuron is one of the main sulfonylurea herbicides that have been widely used to protect maize crops. A total of 10 nicosulfuron-degrading strains were isolated from the intestine tract of earthworm Eisenia foetida. Among them, Bacillus velezensis CF57 with the highest degradation efficiency was selected and studied in detail. The degradation characteristics of CF57 showed that it was able to effectively degrade nicosulfuron in a wide range of temperature, pH, and a low inoculation amount, and the response surface analysis revealed that the optimum degradation conditions were 30.8....C, pH 6.31, and inoculation amount 3.04%. Meanwhile, CF57 could degrade high-concentration nicosulfuron efficiently and posed a broad degradation spectrum of other sulfonylurea herbicides. Furthermore, the localization of degradation enzyme indicated that the nicosulfuron-degrading enzyme was an extracellular fraction.

Strains of Xylella fastidiosa subsp. pauca characterized by a specific genotype, the so called sequence type "ST53", have been associated with a severe disease named Olive Quick Decline Syndrome (OQDS). Despite the relevant research efforts devoted to control the disease caused by X. fastidiosa, so far there are no therapeutic means able to cure the infected host plants. As such, the aim of this study was the identification of antagonistic bacteria potentially deployable as bio-control agents against X. fastidiosa. To this end, two approaches were used, i.e. the evaluation of the antagonistic activity of: i) endophytic bacteria isolated from olive trees located in an infected area but showing mild or no symptoms, and ii) Bacillus strains, as they are already known as bio-control agents.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are good alternatives for chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which cause severe environmental problems worldwide. Even though many studies focus on PGPR, most of them are limited in plant-microbe interaction studies and neglect the pathogens affecting ruminants that consume plants. In this study, we expand the view to the food chain of grass-ruminant-human. We aimed to find biocontrol strains that can antagonize grass pathogens and mammalian pathogens originated from grass, thus protecting this food chain. Furthermore, we deeply mined into bacterial genomes for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) that can contribute to biocontrol. We screened 90 bacterial strains from the rhizosphere of healthy Dutch perennial ryegrass and characterized seven strains (B. subtilis subsp. subtilis MG27, B. velezensis MG33 and MG43, B. pumilus MG52 and MG84, B. altitudinis MG75, and B. laterosporus MG64) that showed a stimulatory effect on grass growth and	2020	10	26	BMC Genomics	BMC genomics	Bacillus; Bacteriocins; Biosynthetic gene clusters; Brevibacillus; Nonribosomal peptides; Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria; Polyketides; Burkholderiales; Data Mining; Genome, Bacterial; Genomics; Humans; Lolium; Phylogeny; Plant Development; Symbiosis	Li	Zhibo

Many representatives of the Bacillus subtilis species complex are known as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and are widely used in agriculture as biofertilizers and biocontrol agents. Two bacterial strains, "Korea isolate" and ZL918, taxonomically classified as being Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, isolated from disease-damaged plant organs, were alleged to cause bacterial rot in starchy storage plant organs. The aim of this study was to elucidate whether these findings have consequences for the general use of beneficial Bacilli in agriculture. Whole genome sequencing revealed that the pathogenic ZL918 was a representative of Bacillus velezensis. B. velezensis FZB42 and other representatives of the B. subtilis species complex caused the same symptoms of bacterial rot only when injected inside of potato tubers and onion bulbs, but not when inoculated onto the surface of the storage organs.

Many aspects regarding the role of lipopeptides (LPs) in bacterial interaction with plants are not clear yet. Of particular interest is the LP family of surfactin, immunogenic molecules involved in induced systemic resistance (ISR) and the bacterial colonization of plant surfaces. We hypothesize that the concentration of surfactin produced by a strain correlates directly with its ability to colonize and persist on different plant surfaces, which conditions its capacity to trigger ISR. We used two Bacillus velezensis strains (BBC023 and BBC047), whose antagonistic potential in vitro is practically identical, but not on plant surfaces. The surfactin production of BBC047 is 1/3 higher than that of BBC023. Population density and SEM images revealed stable biofilms of BBC047 on leaves and roots, activating ISR on both plant surfaces.

Bacillus velezensis is considered as a model species belonging to the so-called Bacillus subtilis complex that evolved typically to dwell in the soil rhizosphere niche and establish an intimate association with plant roots. This bacterium provides protection to its natural host against diseases and represents one of the most promising biocontrol agents. However, the molecular basis of the cross talk that this bacterium establishes with its natural host has been poorly investigated. We show here that these plant-associated bacteria have evolved a polymer-sensing system to perceive their host and that, in response, they increase the production of the surfactin-type lipopeptide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surfactin synthesis is favored upon growth on root exudates and that this lipopeptide is a key component used by the bacterium to optimize biofilm formation, motility, and early root colonization.

Bacillus spp. have been used as a biocontrol strategy to eliminate/reduce toxic fungicides in viticulture. Furthermore, the presence of fungi that are resistant to commonly used products is frequent, highlighting the need for new biocontrol strains. Aspergillus carbonarius can produce ochratoxins, including ochratoxin A (OTA), which has a regulatory maximum allowable limit for grape products. The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of four Amazonian strains of Bacillus (P1, P7, P11, and P45) to biocontrol A. carbonarius and various forms of ochratoxins in grapes. Berries treated with strain P1 presented no fungal colonies (100% reduction), while P7, P11 and P45 strains caused a reduction of 95, 95 and 61% on fungal counts, respectively. Six forms of ochratoxin were found in the grapes inoculated with A. carbonarius, including ochratoxin .., ochratoxin .., ochratoxin .. methyl-ester, ochratoxin .. amide, N-formyl-ochratoxin .. amide, and OT	2022	2	7	Food Addit Contam Part A Chem Anal Control Expo Risk Assess	Food additives &amp; contaminants.

Probiotic Bacillus colonization of plant root surfaces has been reported to improve its beneficial effect. Chemotaxis, adhesion, aggregation, and biofilm formation are the four steps of root colonization by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs). Compared with the other three well-studied processes, adhesion of PGPRs is less known. In this study, using mutant strains deleted for potential adhesin genes in PGPR strain Bacillus velezensis SQR9, adherence to both cucumber root surface and abiotic surface by those strains was evaluated. Results showed that deletion mutations ..lytB, ..V529_10500, ..fliD, ..yhaN, and ..sacB reduced the adhesion to root surfaces, while, among them, only ..fliD had significant defects in adhesion to abiotic surfaces (glass and polystyrene).

34689397	10.1002/ps.6685	The combination of two Bacillus strains suppresses Meloidogyne incognita and fungal pathogens, but does not enhance plant growth.	The combination of biocontrol agents is a desirable strategy to improve control efficacy against the root-knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita under field conditions. However, strains compatibility is generally tested in vitro and incompatible combinations are normally not further examined in experiments in planta. Therefore, there is virtually no information on the performance of incompatible strains. In this study, we evaluated two Bacillus strains previously described as incompatible in vitro for effects on plant growth and suppression of M. incognita, pathogenic fungi and nematophagous fungi. Strains BMH and INV were shown to be closely related to Bacillus velezensis. These strains, when applied individually, reduced the number of galls and eggs of M. incognita by more than 90% in tomato roots. When BMH and INV were combined (BMH...+...INV), RKN suppression and tomato shoot weight were lower compared to single-strain applications.

Although plant roots encounter a plethora of microorganisms in the surrounding soil, at the rhizosphere, plants exert selective forces on their bacterial colonizers. Unlike immune recognition of pathogenic bacteria, the mechanisms by which beneficial bacteria are selected and how they interact with the plant immune system are not well understood. To better understand this process, we studied the interaction of auxin-producing Bacillus velezensis FZB42 with Arabidopsis roots and found that activation of the plant immune system is necessary for efficient bacterial colonization and auxin secretion. A feedback loop is established in which bacterial colonization triggers an immune reaction and production of reactive oxygen species, which, in turn, stimulate auxin production by the bacteria. Auxin promotes bacterial survival and efficient root colonization, allowing the bacteria to inhibit fungal infection and promote plant health.

Its genes are well preserved, with their majority being common with other Bacillus spp. strains and responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites known to be involved in biocontrol and plant growth-promoting activities. No antibiotic resistance genes were found in the B25 strain plasmid.

Production of highly efficient biomass-based microbial biopesticides significantly depends on downstream processing in terms of obtaining as high concentration of viable cells as possible. Microfiltration is one of the recommended operations for microbial biomass separation, but its main limitation is permeate flux decrease due to the membrane fouling. The effect of air sparging as a hydrodynamic technique for improvement of permeate flux during microfiltration of Bacillus velezensis cultivation broth was investigated. Modeling of the microfiltration was performed using the response surface methodology, while desirability function approach and genetic algorithm were applied for optimization, i.e., maximization of permeate flux and minimization of specific energy consumption. The results have revealed antagonistic relationship between the investigated dependent variables.

34553246	10.1007/s00438-021-01816-8	Comprehensive genomic analysis of Bacillus velezensis AL7 reveals its biocontrol potential against Verticillium wilt of cotton.	Verticilllium wilt of cotton is a devastating soil-borne disease, which is caused by Verticillium dahliae Kleb. Bacillus velezensis strain AL7 was isolated from cotton soil. This strain efficiently inhibited the growth of V. dahliae. But the mechanism of the biocontrol strain AL7 remains poorly understood. To understand the possible genetic determinants for biocontrol traits of this strain, we conducted phenotypic, phylogenetic and comparative genomics analysis. Phenotypic analysis showed that strain AL7 exhibited broad-spectrum antifungal activities. We determined that the whole genome sequence of B. velezensis AL7 is a single circular chromosome that is 3.89..Mb in size. The distribution of putative gene clusters that could benefit to biocontrol activities was found in the genome. Phylogenetic analysis of Bacillus strains by using single core-genome clearly placed strain AL7 into the B. velezensis.

Soybean root rot caused by the oomycete Phytophthora sojae is a serious soilborne disease threatening soybean production in China. Bacillus velezensis FZB42 is a model strain for Gram-positive plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and is able to produce multiple antibiotics. In this study, we demonstrated that B. velezensis FZB42 can efficiently antagonize P. sojae. The underlying mechanism for the inhibition was then investigated. The FZB42 mutants deficient in the synthesis of lipopeptides (bacillomycin D and fengycin), known to have antifungal activities, and polyketides (bacillaene, difficidin, and macrolactin), known to have antibacterial activities, were not impaired in their antagonism toward P. sojae; in contrast, mutants deficient in bacilysin biosynthesis completely lost their antagonistic activities toward P. sojae, indicating that bacilysin was responsible for the activity. Isolated pure bacilysin confirmed this inference.

Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) induce systemic resistance (SR) in plants, decreasing the development of phytopathogens. The FZB42 strain of Bacillus velezensis is known to induce an SR against pathogens in various plant species. Previous studies suggested that it could also influence the interactions between plants and associated pests. However, insects have developed several strategies to counteract plant defenses, including salivary proteins that allow the insect escaping detection, manipulating defensive pathways to its advantage, deactivating early signaling processes, or detoxifying secondary metabolites. Because Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (BMSB) Halyomorpha halys is highly invasive and polyphagous, we hypothesized that it could detect the PGPR-induced systemic defenses in the plant, and efficiently adapt its salivary compounds to counteract them. Therefore, we inoculated a beneficial rhizobacterium on Vicia faba roots and soil, previous to plant infestation with BMSB	2021	10	12	J Chem Ecol	Journal of chemical ecology	Brown marmorated stink bug; LC...MS/MS; Plant..growth-promoting rhizobacteria; Proteomics; Salivary glands; Animals; Bacillus; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Heteroptera; Larva; Salivary Glands; Salivary Proteins and Peptides; Stress, Physiological; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Up-Regulation; Vicia faba	Serteyn	Laurent

Botrytis bunch rot caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of the most economically significant post-harvest diseases of grapes. In the present study, we showed that the bacterial strain Bvel1 is phylogenetically affiliated to Bacillus velezensis species. The strain Bvel1 and its secreted metabolites exerted an antifungal activity, under in vitro conditions, against B. cinerea. UHPLC-HRMS chemical analysis revealed that iturin A2, surfactin-C13 and -C15, oxydifficidin, bacillibactin, L-dihydroanticapsin, and azelaic acid were among the metabolites secreted by Bvel1. Treatment of wounded grape berries with Bacillus sp. Bvel1 cell culture was effective for controlling grey mold ingress and expansion in vivo.

Genome sequencing revealed that GUMT319 contained a single circular chromosome 3,940,023 bp in length, with 4,053 predicted genes and an average GC content of 46.6%. Based on phylogenomic analyses, GUMT319 was designated as Bacillus velezensis. The genome of GUMT319 contained more than 60 genes and 13 gene clusters that have previously been found to be active in antifungal mechanisms, biofilm formation, and chemotaxis motility. Additionally, confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that GUMT319 formed a spatially organized biofilm in vivo. In addition, lauric acid negatively regulated biofilm formation.

Antagonistic activity of strains from Bacillus species has made them among the preferred agricultural biological control agents against phytopathogenic fungi. These microorganisms' success is mostly based on the production of antagonistic secondary metabolites, mainly those of the non-ribosomal cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) nature, which can affect phytopathogens directly (iturins and fengycins) or indirectly (surfactins and fengycins). However, abiotic factors in the target site can influence the behavior of the biocontrol traits, but to date, few studies attempting to decipher this kind of interaction have been conducted. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of temperature and culture medium on growth, antagonistic activity against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. physali (Foph), and the profile of CLPs produced by Bacillus velezensis Bs006. The data showed that measured traits in Bs006 varied with temperature and medium interaction.

Members of the genus Bacillus are known to play an important role in promoting plant growth and protecting plants against phytopathogenic microorganisms. In this study, 21 isolates of Bacillus spp. were obtained from the root micro-ecosystem of Suaeda glauca. Analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that the isolates belong to the species Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus velezensis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus aryabhattai and Brevibacterium frigoritolerans. One of the interesting findings of this study is that the four strains B1, B5, B16 and B21 are dominant in rhizosphere soil. Based on gyrA, gyrB, and rpoB gene analyses, B1, B5, and B21 were identified as B. amyloliquefaciens and B16 was identified as B. velezensis.

The potential use of Bacillus velezensis FZB42 for biological control of various phytopathogens has been documented over the past few years, but its antagonistic interactions with xanthomonads has not been studied in detail. Novel aspects in this study consist of close observation of the death of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris cells in a co-culture with B. velezensis FZB42, and quantification of lipopeptides and a siderophore, bacillibactin, involved in the killing process. A new robust Xcc-SU isolate tolerating high concentrations of ferric ions was used. In a co-culture with the antagonist, the population of Xcc-SU was entirely destroyed within 24-48 h, depending on the number of antagonist cells used for inoculation. No inhibitory effect of Xcc-SU on B. velezensis was observed.

S-ribosylhomocysteine lyase (LuxS) has been shown to regulate bacterial multicellular behaviors, typically biofilm formation. However, the mechanisms for the regulation are still mysterious. We previously identified a malonylation modification on K124 and K130 of the LuxS in the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium B.&amp;nbsp;velezensis (FZB42). In this work, we investigated the effects of the two malonylation sites on biofilm formation and other biological characteristics of FZB42. The results showed that the K124R mutation could severely impair biofilm formation, swarming, and sporulation but promote AI-2 production, suggesting inhibitory effects of high-level AI-2 on the features. All mutations (K124R, K124E, K130R, and K130E) suppressed FZB42 sporulation but increased its antibiotic production. The double mutations generally had a synergistic effect or at least equal to the effects of the single mutations.

In many vineyards around the world, Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea) causes one of the most serious diseases of aerial grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) organs. The control of the disease relies mainly on the use of chemical products whose use is increasingly challenged. To develop new sustainable methods to better resist B. cinerea, beneficial bacteria were isolated from vineyard soil. Once screened based on their antimicrobial effect through an in vivo test, two bacterial strains, S3 and S6, were able to restrict the development of the pathogen and significantly reduced the Botrytis-related necrosis. The photosynthesis analysis showed that the antagonistic strains also prevent grapevines from considerable irreversible PSII photo-inhibition four days after infection with B. cinerea.

In this study, oil degrading bacteria discovered from fish living near the oil ports at Karachi in Pakistan were characterized. The bacteria isolated from skin, gills, and gut in fish could consume crude oil as a source of carbon and energy. Total 36 isolates were tested using Nutrient Agar (NA) and MSA media with different crude oil concentrations (0.2%, 0.5%, 0.7%, 1%, 2%, and 5%) and 4 out of 36 isolates (two Gram positive and two Gram negative bacteria) were selected for further identification. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the isolates are related to Bacillus velezensis, Bacillus flexus, Pseudomonas brenneri and Pseudomonas azotoforman. Oil degrading potential of these bacteria was characterized by GC-MS analysis of degradation of oil components in crude oil as well as engine oil. We found that one (2, 6, 10, 14-Tetramethylpentadecane) out of 42 components in the crude oil was fully eliminated and the other oil components were reduced.

Bacillus velezensis Bs006 has shown antagonistic activity on Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. physali and biocontrol activity against Fusarium wilt (FW) in golden berry (Physalis peruviana). We hypothesized that strain Bs006 has the ability to synthesize antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) like other members of the same species. However, if so, the real effects of CLPs on F. oxysporum f. sp. physali and their potential as a biocontrol tool against Physalis-FW have not been elucidated.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous in the environment. They are highly toxigenic and carcinogenic. Probiotic bacteria isolated from fermented foods were tested to check their ability to degrade and/or detoxify PAHs. Five probiotic bacteria with distinct morphologies were isolated from a mixture of 26 fermented foods co-cultured with benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) containing Bushnell Haas minimal broth. Among them, B. velezensis (PMC10) significantly reduced the abundance of BaP in the broth. PMC10 completely degraded BaP presented at a lower concentration in broth culture. B. velezensis also showed a clear zone of degradation on a BaP-coated Bushnell Haas agar plate. Gene expression profiling showed significant increases of PAH ringhydroxylating dioxygenases and 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase genes in B. velezensis in response to BaP treatment.

Bacterial spores are important in food processing due to their ubiquity, resistance to high temperature and chemical inactivation. This work aims to study the effect of ultraviolet C (UVC) on the spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus velezensis at a molecular and individual level to guide in deciding on the right parameters that must be applied during the processing of liquid foods. The spores were treated with UVC using phosphate buffer saline (PBS) as a suspension medium and their lethality rate was determined for each sample. Purified spore samples of B. velezensis and B. subtilis were treated under one pass in a UVC reactor to inactivate the spores. The resistance pattern of the spores to UVC treatment was determined using dipicolinic acid (Ca-DPA) band of spectral analysis obtained from Raman spectroscopy. Flow cytometry analysis was also done to determine the effect of the UVC treatment on the spore samples at the molecular level.

The heavy use of prophylactic antibiotics in aquaculture leads to elevated antibiotic residues, posing a huge hidden danger in aquaculture products and other natural aquatic environments. Therefore, this study aims to isolate probiotics that can replace antibiotics from the gut of grass carp for disease control. Bacillus velezensis B8 was isolated from the gut of grass carp and showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against several fish pathogenic bacteria, including Aeromonas hydrophilis, Aeromonas veronii, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio mimicus. The safety evaluation showed that the strain B8 was non-toxic to grass carp, had no hemolytic activity, and was sensitive to most antibiotics. In vitro study indicated that strain B8 was viable at pH 2-7, had weak tolerance to 0.1% (w/v) bile salt, and could grow at 10..C-40....C.

Food waste (FW) minimization at the source by using food waste biodigester (FWBs) has a vast potential to lower down the impact of increasing organic fraction in municipal solid waste generation. To this end, this research sought to check the performance of locally isolated hydrolase-producing bacteria (HPB) to improve food waste biodegradation rate. Two under-explored HPB identified as Bacillus paralicheniformis GRA2 and Bacillus velezensis TAP5 were able to produce maximum amylase, cellulase, protease and lipase activities, and demonstrated a significant hydrolase synergy in co-culture fermentation. In vitro biodegradation analysis of both autoclaved and non-autoclaved FW revealed that the HPB inoculation was effective to degrade total solids (&gt;62%), protein (&gt;19%), total fat (&gt;51), total sugar (&gt;86%), reducing sugar (&gt;38%) and starch (&gt;50%) after 8-day incubation.

Owing to the excellent properties of photosensitization, cercosporin, one of naturally occurring perylenequinonoid pigments, has been widely used in photodynamic therapy, or as an antimicrobial agent and an organophotocatalyst. However, because of low efficiency of total chemical synthesis and low yield of current microbial fermentation, the limited production restricts its broad applications. Thus, the strategies to improve the production of cercosporin were highly desired. Besides traditional optimization methods, here we screened leaf-spot-disease-related endophytic bacteria to co-culture with our previous identified Cercospora sp. JNU001 to increase cercosporin production. Bacillus velezensis B04 and Lysinibacillus sp. B15 isolated from leaves with leaf spot diseases were found to facilitate cercosporin secretion into the broth and then enhance the production of cercosporin.

The conjugative plasmid (pBV71) possibly confers a selective advantage to Bacillus velezensis strain GH1-13, although a selective marker gene is yet to be identified. Here we show that few non-mucoid wild-type GH1-13 cells are spontaneously converted to mucoid variants with or without the loss of pBV71. Mucoid phenotypes, which contain or lack the plasmid, become sensitive to bacitracin, gramicidin, selenite, and tellurite. Using the differences in antibiotic resistance and phenotype, we isolated a reverse complement (COM) and a transconjugant of strain FZB42 with the native pBV71. Transformed COM and FZB42p cells were similar to the wild-type strain GH1-13 with high antibiotic resistance and slow growth rates on lactose compared to those of mucoid phenotypes. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of plasmid-encoded orphan aspartate phosphatase (pRapD) was coordinated with a new quorum-sensing (QS) cassette of RapF2-PhrF2 present in the chromosome of strain GH1-13, but not in st	2021	8	9	Commun Biol	Communications biology	Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Conjugation, Genetic; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Gene Expression Profiling; Plant Development; Plasmids; Proteome; Quorum Sensing	Choi	Yunhee

Infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have reached epidemic proportions globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a continuous supply of antibiotics to combat the problem. In this study, bacteria initially identified as species belonging to the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens operational group were re-identified based on the housekeeping gene, gyrB. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) from the strains were used for antimicrobial tests using the agar well diffusion assay against MRSA and various types of pathogenic bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and physicochemical characteristics of the CFS were determined. Based on gyrB sequence analysis, five strains (PD9, B7, PU1, BP1 and L9) were identified as Bacillus velezensis. The CFS of all B. velezensis strains showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-negative and -positive as well as MRSA strains.

This article studied the inactivation effect of PEF on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus velezensis under different initial temperatures (room temperature-24 [Formula: see text], 30 [Formula: see text], 40 [Formula: see text], 50 [Formula: see text]). From the inactivation results, it found temperature could reduce the critical electric field intensity for microbial inactivation. After the irreversible electroporation of microorganisms occurred, the nucleic acid content and protein content in the suspension increased with the inactivation rate because the cell membrane integrity was destroyed. We had proved that the electric field and temperature could promote molecular transport through the finite element simulatio	2021	4	13	AMB Express	AMB Express	Critical electric field intensity; Initial temperature; Nucleic acid content; Protein content; Pulsed electric fields	Yan	Zeyao

36195331	10.1093/femsle/fnac095	Extracellular lactonase mediated quorum quenching by a novel Bacillus velezensis.	Many Gram-negative bacteria coordinate their gene expression via quorum sensing (QS) mediated by small diffusible autoinducer molecules such as Acyl Homoseriene Lactones (AHL). The degradation of AHLs or quorum quenching (QQ) imparts less selection pressure on the target organisms leading to a possible alternative to antimicrobial agents and traditional biofilm control methods. Here, a novel strain of Bacillus velezensis, strain PM7, exhibiting extracellular quorum quenching (QQ) activity against Gram-negative bacteria has been isolated. Analytical studies of the AHL degradation using LC-MS as well as bioreporters revealed the mechanism of QQ as homoserine lactone ring hydrolysis. Using molecular techniques, the presence of an aiiA homologues gene, specific for acyl homoserine lactonase enzyme, was confirmed in the bacterium. A biofilm inhibitory activity in the range of 36.9 to 77.4% was achieved by the PM7 against three different Gram-negative bacteria.

Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) have attracted much attention in agriculture biotechnology as biological inputs to sustain crop production. The present study describes a halotolerant phosphate solubilizing bacterium associated with quinoa plant roots. Based on a metabolic screening, one bacterial isolate, named QA2, was selected and screened for PGPR traits. This isolate solubilized both inorganic phosphate and zinc, produced indole-3-acetic acid, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, cellulase, and (to be deleted) protease, and induced biofilm formation. We demonstrated that QA2 exhibited both antimicrobial and ion metabolism activities and tolerated high salt concentration at up to 11% NaCl. Genotyping analyses, using 16S rRNA and chaperonin cpn60 genes, revealed that QA2 belongs to the species of Bacillus velezensis. Using the quinoa model cultivated under a saline condition, we demonstrated that QA2 promoted plant growth and mitigated the saline irrigation eff	2022	9	28	Microorganisms	Microorganisms	Bacillus velezensis; Chenopodium quinoa; biocontrol; phosphate solubilizing bacteria; plant growth promotion; salt stress	Mahdi	Ismail

Due to issues with disease and nutrients, farmers cannot use continuous cropping techniques on ginger, meaning that the ginger industry is constantly searching for new land. Continuous cropping increases the risk of infection by Pythium myriotylum and Ralstonia solanacearum, which cause soft rot disease and bacterial wilt, respectively. In addition, fertilizer additives, which are commonly used to increase trace elements in the soil, cannot restore the soil when it is undergoing continuous cropping on ginger, even when there has been no observable decrease in trace elements in the soil. Recent studies about soil microbiome manipulation and the application of microorganisms have shown that plant-associated microbes have the ability to improve plant growth and facilitate sustainable agriculture, but studies of this kind still need to be carried out on ginger cultivation.

Soybean and maize are some of the main drivers of Brazilian agribusiness. However, biotic and abiotic factors are of great concern, causing huge grain yield and quality losses. Phosphorus (P) deficiency is important among the abiotic factors because most Brazilian soils have a highly P-fixing nature. Thus, large amounts of phosphate fertilizers are regularly applied to overcome the rapid precipitation of P. Searching for alternatives to improve the use of P by crops is essential to reduce the demand for P input. The use of multifunctional rhizobacteria can be considered one of these alternatives. In this sense, the objective of the present work was to select and validate bacterial strains with triple action (plant growth promoter, phosphate solubilizer, and biocontrol agent) in maize and soybean, aiming to develop a multifunctional microbial inoculant for Brazilian agriculture.

The microbial community associated with animals (microbiome) is essential for development, physiology, and health of host organisms. A critical step to understand the assembly of microbiomes is to determine how effectively bacteria colonize and establish within the host. Bacteria commonly colonize hosts through vertical transmission, passively from the environment, or through food consumption. Using the prey feeding method (PFM), we test transmittance of Bacillus velezensis, Pseudoalteromonas spiralis, and Vibrio alginolyticus to Nematostella vectensis using two prey, Artemia salina and Brachionus plicatilis. We compare PFM to a solution uptake method (SUM) to quantify the concentration of bacteria in these host organisms, with plate counts.

Induced systemic resistance (ISR) is one of the most studied mechanisms of plant-microbe interaction and is considered a very promising alternative for integrated pest management programs. In our study, we explored the plant defense response induced by Bacillus velezensis BBC047 in relation to its application before or after Botrytis cinerea infection of tomato plants. The inoculation of BBC047 did not considerably alter the gene expression of the tomato tissues, whereas infection with B. cinerea in BBC047-primed plants induced expression of LRR and NBS-LRR receptors, which are highly related to the ISR response. As expected, B. cinerea infection generated molecular patterns typical of a defense response to pathogen infection as the overexpression of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) in leaflets distant to the point of infection.

Antagonism is a common behavior seen between microbes in nature. Alcaligenes ammonioxydans HO-1 converts ammonia to nitrogen under aerobic conditions, which leads to the accumulation of extracellular hydroxylamine (HA), providing pronounced growth advantages against many bacterial genera, including Bacillus velezensis V4. In contrast, a mutant variant of A. ammonioxydans, strain 2-29, that cannot produce HA fails to antagonize other bacteria. In this article, we demonstrate that cell-free supernatants derived from the antagonistic HO-1 strain were sufficient to reproduce the antagonistic behavior and the efficiency of this inhibition correlated strongly with the HA content of the supernatant. Furthermore, reintroducing the capacity to produce HA to the 2-29 strain or supplementing bacterial co-cultures with HA restored antagonistic behavior. The HA-mediated antagonism was dose-dependent and affected by the temperature, but not by pH.

Wild rice is an important improved resource for cultivated rice and its unique ability to resist biotic and abiotic stress has attracted the attention of many scholars. The microbial community structure in the rhizosphere and leaf area of different rice varieties is also different, which may be one of the reasons for the difference in stress resistance between wild rice and cultivated rice. Forty-six bacteria were screened from the rhizosphere and phyllospheric of four different wild rice varieties. The results of functions of the screened strains showed that 18 strains had a good inhibitory effect on rice blast, and 33 strains had the ability to dissolve phosphorus, potassium, or fix nitrogen. Through potted experiment, the three bacterial strains, 499G2 (Peribacillus simplex), 499G3 (Bacillus velezensis), and 499G4 (B. megaterium) have a positive effect on the growth of cultivated rice in addition to the resistance to rice blast.

Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto is, worldwide, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight in small cereal crops such as wheat, barley, and oat. The pathogen causes not only reductions in yield and grain quality but also contamination with type-B trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol. Prevention strategies include the use of less susceptible cultivars through breeding programs, cultural practices, crop rotation, fungicide application, or a combination of them through an integrated pest management. Additionally, the use of more eco-friendly strategies by the evaluation of microorganisms and natural products is increasing. The effect of combining Bacillus velezensis RC218 and chitosan on Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and deoxynivalenol accumulation under greenhouse and field conditions in bread and durum wheat was evaluated.

The gastrointestinal microbial community plays a crucial role in host health, immunity, protection, development and provides nutrients to the host. The rising human-induced pollution and heavy metal contamination in all aquatic systems globally has led us to explore the gut microbial diversity of two exotic invasive fish Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1858) and Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus,1857) from river Yamuna, India. These fishes are aquatic bioindicators with high demographic resilience. Exploring these associations would pave the way for addressing problems that inhabitant fishes are facing due to the increasing pollution load in the River Yamuna. Based on 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, our results deliver comparative information on the gut microbiome of these fishes and highlight connotations between the microbiome of gut and water samples.

Bacillus velezensis is a widely used biocontrol agent closely related to B. amyloliquefaciens, and the two species cannot be distinguished by universal primers that are currently available. The study aimed to establish a rapid, specific detection approach for B. velezensis. Many unique gene sequences of B. velezensis were selected through whole genome sequence alignment of B. velezensis strains and were used to design a series of forward and reverse primers, which were then screened by PCR and qPCR using different Bacillus samples as templates. The colonization ability of B. velezensis ZF2 in different soils and different soil environmental conditions was measured by qPCR and a 10-fold dilution plating assay. A specific primer pair targeting the sequence of the D3N19_RS13500 gene of B. velezensis ZF2 was screened and could successfully distinguish B. velezensis from B. amyloliquefaciens.

Bacillus velezensis has recently received increasing attention as a biological fungicide and a potential probiotic agent because of its broad spectrum of antibacterial and antifungal activities. Here, we evaluated the beneficial traits of a newly isolated B. velezensis strain LOH112 using comprehensive bioinformatics and comparative genomic analyses and in vitro experimental approaches. Whole genome sequencing and assembly results showed that the genome of LOH112 consists of a circular chromosome and a circular plasmid, which encodes proteins involved in important biological processes such as sporulation, quorum sensing, and antibiotic synthesis. LOH112 contains 13 secondary metabolism gene clusters responsible for the production of antimicrobial compounds. In vitro experiments showed that LOH112 effectively inhibits several fungi and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, hydrolyzes protein and cellulose, and is capable of forming strong adhesive biofilms.

Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a significant health threat worldwide. C. difficile is an opportunistic, toxigenic pathogen that takes advantage of a disrupted gut microbiome to grow and produce signs and symptoms ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. Antibiotics used to treat C. difficile infection are usually broad spectrum and can further disrupt the commensal gut microbiota, leaving patients susceptible to recurrent C. difficile infection. There is a growing need for therapeutic options that can continue to inhibit the outgrowth of C. difficile after antibiotic treatment is completed. Treatments that degrade C. difficile toxins while having minimal collateral impact on gut bacteria are also needed to prevent recurrence. Therapeutic bacteria capable of producing a range of antimicrobial compounds, proteases, and other bioactive metabolites represent a potentially powerful tool for preventing CDI recurrence following resolution of symptoms.

In this work, we investigate, in different liquid coculture conditions, the compatibility of two microorganisms with the potential for the biocontrol of plant diseases: the fungus Trichoderma harzianum IHEM5437 and the bacterium Bacillus velezensis GA1 (a strong antifungal lipopeptide producing strain). While the Bacillus overgrew the Trichoderma in a rich medium due to its antifungal lipopeptide production, a drastically different trend was observed in a medium in which a nitrogen nutritional dependency was imposed. Indeed, in this minimum medium containing nitrate as the sole nitrogen source, cooperation between the bacterium and the fungus was established.

Previous research determined that many Bacillus velezensis PGPR strains can use pectin as a sole carbon source and that seed inoculation with PGPR plus pectin-rich orange peel (OP) can enhance PGPR-mediated increases in plant growth. Because the previous studies used a single soybean cultivar, the objective of this research was to test the effect of PGPR plus OP inoculation on plant responses in a wide range of soybean cultivars. Preliminary screening with 20 soybean cultivars in the greenhouse showed that the PGPR plus OP produced a positive increase in all plant growth parameters when all cultivar data was averaged. However, when the inoculation response was examined cultivar by cultivar there was a range of cultivar response from a 60% increase in growth parameters to a 12% decrease, pointing to the presence of a cultivar-PGPR 	2022	5	17	Plants (Basel)	Plants (Basel, Switzerland)	cultivar variation; nitrogen fixation; orange peel; photosynthesis; plant growth promotion rhizobacteria; root growth; yield	Pacheco da Silva	Maria Let..cia

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) influence plant health. However, the genotypic variations in host organisms affect their response to PGPR. To understand the genotypic effect, we screened four diverse B. distachyon genotypes at varying growth stages for their ability to be colonized by B. velezensis strain B26. We reasoned that B26 may have an impact on the phenological growth stages of B. distachyon genotypes. Phenotypic data suggested the role of B26 in increasing the number of awns and root weight in wild type genotypes and overexpressing transgenic lines. Thus, we characterized the expression patterns of flowering pathway genes in inoculated plants and found that strain B26 modulates the transcript abundance of flowering genes. An increased root volume of inoculated plants was estimated by CT-scanning which suggests the role of B26 in altering the root architecture. B26 also modulated plant hormone homeostasis.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate possible interactions between two potential plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB): Azospirillum oryzae strain NBT506 and Bacillus velezensis strain UTB96. To do this, the growth kinetic, biofilm formation, motility, surfactin production, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, phosphate solubilization and enzyme activities of the strains were measured in monoculture and co-culture. The maximum biomass production for the strains in monoculture and co-culture was about 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/ml, confirming that these two strains have the potential to grow in co-culture without reduction of biomass efficiency. The co-culture system showed more stable biofilm formation until the end of day 3. Azospirillum showed the maximum IAA production (41.5..mg/l) in a monoculture compared to other treatments. Surfactin promoted both swimming and swarming motility in all treatments.

35482131	10.1007/s00018-022-04292-4	Listeria monocytogenes exposed to antimicrobial peptides displays differential regulation of lipids and proteins associated to stress response.	With the onset of Listeria monocytogenes resistance to the bacteriocin nisin, the search for alternative antimicrobial treatments is of fundamental importance. In this work, we set out to investigate proteins and lipids involved in the resistance mechanisms of L. monocytogenes against the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) nisin and fengycin. The effect of sub-lethal concentrations of nisin and lipopeptide fengycin secreted by Bacillus velezensis P34 on L. monocytogenes was investigated by mass spectrometry-based lipidomics and proteomics. Both AMPs caused a differential regulation of biofilm formation, confirming the promotion of cell attachment and biofilm assembling after treatment with nisin, whereas growth inhibition was observed after fengycin treatment. Anteiso branched-chain fatty acids were detected in higher amounts in fengycin-treated samples (46.6%) as compared to nisin-treated and control samples (39.4% and 43.4%, respectively).

Bacillus velezensis possesses numerous chitinolytic enzymes; however, not much is known about the role of its chitinase molecules. In this study, the chiA gene, which encodes a novel domain structure possessing family 18 chitinase from B. velezensis RB.IBE29, was expressed successfully in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL using the pColdII expression vector. The recombinant protein, rBvChiA, was purified using the HisTrap FF column. Purified rBvChiA showed hydrolytic activity against insoluble chitin and bound to chitinous substrates. In addition, the purified recombinant enzyme displayed remarkable inhibition effects on the spore germination of Fusarium falciforme and the egg hatch of root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), which are the main causes of black pepper diseases in the Central Highlands region, Vietnam.

Root colonization and plant probiotic function are important traits of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Bacillus velezensis SC60, a plant endophytic strain screened from Sesbania cannabina, has a strong colonization ability on various plant roots, which indicates that SC60 has a preferable adaptability to plants. However, the probiotic function of the strain SC60 is not well-understood. Promoting plant growth and suppressing soil-borne pathogens are key to the plant probiotic functions. In this study, the genetic mechanism of plant growth-promoting and antibacterial activity of the strain SC60 was analyzed by biological and bioinformatics methods. The complete genome size of strain SC60 was 3,962,671 bp, with 4079 predicted genes and an average GC content of 46.46%.

Bacillus spp. supplementation as probiotics in cultured fish diets has a long history of safe and effective use. Specifically, B. velezensis show great promise in fine-tuning the European sea bass disease resistance against the pathogenicity caused by several members of the Vibrio family. However, the immunomodulatory mechanisms behind this response remain poorly understood. Here, to examine the inherent immune variations in sea bass, two equal groups were fed for 30 days with a steady diet, with one treatment supplemented with B. velezensis. The serum bactericidal capacity against live cells of Vibrio anguillarum strain 507 and the nitric oxide and lysozyme lytic activities were assayed. At the cellular level, the phagocytic response of peripheral blood leukocytes against inactivated Candida albicans was determined. Moreover, head-kidney (HK) total leukocytes were isolated from previously in vivo treated fish with LPS of V. anguillarum strain 507.

(1) Background: Bacillus velezensis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens are closely related members of the "operational group B. amyloliquefaciens", a taxonomical unit above species level within the "Bacillus subtilis species complex". They have similar morphological, physiological, biochemical, phenotypic, and phylogenetic characteristics. Thus, separating these two taxa from each another has proven to be difficult to implement and could not be pushed easily into the line of routine analyses. (2) Methods: The aim of this study was to determine whether whole FAME profiling could be used to distinguish between these two species, using both type strains and environmental isolates. Initially, the classification was determined by partial sequences of the gyrA and rpoB genes and the classified isolates and type strains were considered as samples to develop the identification method, based on FAME profiles.

Biocontrol agents are sustainable eco-friendly alternatives for chemical pesticides that cause adverse effects in the environment and toxicity in animals including humans. An improved understanding of the phyllosphere microbiology is of vital importance for biocontrol development. Most studies have been directed towards beneficial plant-microbe interactions and ignore the pathogens that might affect humans when consuming vegetables. In this study we extended this perspective and investigated potential biocontrol strains isolated from tomato and lettuce phyllosphere that can promote plant growth and potentially antagonize human pathogens as well as plant pathogens. Subsequently, we mined into their genomes for discovery of antimicrobial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), that will be further characterized.

35171340	10.1007/s00253-022-11831-3	Validation of housekeeping genes as internal controls for gene expression studies on biofilm formation in Bacillus velezensis.	Bacillus velezensis is an important bacterium widely applied in agriculture and industry, and biofilms play critical roles in its environmental tolerance. The appropriate choice of reference genes is essential for key gene expression studies. Multiple internal control genes were selected and validated from the 21 housekeeping genes of B. velezensis by expression stability evaluation during biofilm formation and were used to study the expression of key genes involved in the process. The results showed that pyk, gyrA, recA, and gyrB were stably expressed, and the expression of pyk was the most stable during biofilm formation. A pair of two genes, pyk and gyrA, provided high-quality data when used as internal controls, and the combination of three genes, pyk, gyrA, and recA, was even better. The expression levels of pyk, gyrA, and recA approximated those of five key genes, abrB, epsD, kinC, sinR, and tasA, in biofilm formation, meeting the requirements of ideal internal control genes.

This in vivo study evaluated the bio-protective potential of the aforementioned rhizobacteria strains on maize against the proliferation of the pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum (Fg). The study results show that the bacterized plants were not susceptible to Fg aggression and the antagonists displayed the capability to proliferate in the presence of other likely competing microflora. The screen-house data also suggest that the presence of resident soil microbiota impacted the activity of antagonists (PS9.1 and NWUMFkBS10.5).

Pathogens from the Vibrio and Aeromonas genera often cause detrimental effects to the aquaculture sector. Previously, antibiotics was used to resolve the infections, but this caused the spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes into the environment. As an approach to address this issue, probiotic bacteria were introduced to improve the hosts' microbiome, disease protection, health condition, growth efficiency, feed consumption, stress response and general vigour. However, reports showed that some commercially available probiotics were restricted to a small number of microbial species and there are inconsistencies concerning its effectiveness. Hence, the aim of this study was to isolate and evaluate new Bacillus spp. from the gut of giant freshwater prawn as potential probiotics.

In this work, three genes were identified from the genomic DNA of this bacterium and cloned in Escherichia coli. Sequence analysis exhibited that the ORF of chiA consists of 1,203..bp and encodes deduced 45.46..kDa-chitinase A of 400 aa. The domain structure of chitinase A is composed of a CBM 50 domain at the N-terminus and a catalytic domain at the C-terminus. The ORF of chiB includes 1,263..bp and encodes deduced 47.59..kDa-chitinase B of 420 aa. Chitinase B consists of two CBM50 domains at the N-terminus and a catalytic domain at the C-terminus. The ORF of lpmo10 is 621..bp and encodes a deduced 22.44..kDa-AA10 protein, BvLPMO10 of 206 aa.

35001009	10.4014/jmb.2112.12003	Bacterial Community of Galchi-Baechu Kimchi Based on Culture-Dependent and - Independent Investigation and Selection of Starter Candidates.	In this study, the bacterial community of galchi-baechu kimchi was determined using culture-based and culture-independent techniques (next generation sequencing:NGS), and showed discrepancies between results. Weissella koreensis and Pediococcus inopinatus were the dominant species according to the NGS results, while Bacillus species and P. inopinatus were dominant in the culture-dependent analysis. To identify safe starter candidates, sixty-five Bacillus strains isolated from galchi-baechu kimchi using culture-dependent methods were evaluated for their antibiotic resistance, presence of toxin genes, and hemolytic activity. Strains were then assessed for salt tolerance and protease and lipase activity. As a result, four strains-B. safensis GN5_10, B. subtilis GN5_19, B. velezensis GN5_25, and B. velezensis GT8-were selected as safe starter candidates for use in fermented foods.	2022	3	31	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology	Bacillus; Galchi-baechu kimchi; bacterial community; culture dependent; culture independent; starter; Bacillus; Bacteria; Fermentation; Fermented Foods; Food Microbiology	Kim	Tao
34983528	10.1186/s12934-021-01726-9	Discovery of a novel antibacterial protein CB6-C to target methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.	Given a serious threat of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens to global healthcare, there is an urgent need to find effective antibacterial compounds to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections. In our previous studies, Bacillus velezensis CB6 with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity was obtained from the soil of Changbaishan, China. In this study, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as an indicator bacterium, an antibacterial protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-75 column, QAE-Sephadex A 25 column and RP-HPLC, which demonstrated a molecular weight of 31.405..kDa by SDS-PAGE. LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that the compound was an antibacterial protein CB6-C, which had 88.5% identity with chitosanase (Csn) produced by Bacillus subtilis 168. An antibacterial protein CB6-C showed an effective antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria (in particular, the MIC for MRSA was 16....g/mL), low toxicity, thermostability, stability in dif	2022	1	14	Microb Cell Fact	Microbial cell factories	Antibacterial protein; Bacillus velezensis CB6; Characterization; MRSA; Mechanistic; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; China; Chromatography, Liquid; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Staphylococcal Infections; Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Zhang	Haipeng
34981766	10.1107/S2059798321011724	Structure of the plant growth-promoting factor YxaL from the rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis and its application to protein engineering.	The YxaL protein was isolated from the soil bacterium Bacillus velezensis and has been shown to promote the root growth of symbiotic plants. YxaL has further been suggested to act as an exogenous signaling protein to induce the growth and branching of plant roots. Amino acid sequence analysis predicted YxaL to exhibit an eight-bladed ..-propeller fold stabilized by six tryptophan-docking motifs and two modified motifs. Protein engineering to improve its structural stability is needed to increase the utility of YxaL as a plant growth-promoting factor. Here, the crystal structure of YxaL from B. velezensis was determined at 1.8..... resolution to explore its structural features for structure-based protein engineering. The structure showed the typical eight-bladed ..-propeller fold with structural variations in the third and fourth blades, which may decrease the stability of the ..-propeller fold. Engineered proteins targeting the modified motifs were subsequently created. Crystal structu	2022	3	24	Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol	Acta crystallographica.

34865137	10.1093/plphys/kiab555	Nitrogen fertilization modulates beneficial rhizosphere interactions through signaling effect of nitric oxide.	Chemical nitrogen (N) fertilization is customary for increasing N inputs in agroecosystems. The nutritional effects of N fertilization on plants and soil microbes have been well studied. However, the signaling effects of N fertilization on rhizosphere plant-microbe interactions and the following feedback to plant performance remain unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of different N fertilizations on the behavior of the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) Bacillus velezensis SQR9 in the cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) rhizosphere. Moderate N fertilization promoted higher rhizosphere colonization of strain SQR9 than insufficient or excessive N input. Nitric oxide (NO) produced through the denitrification process under N fertilization was identified as the signaling molecule that dominates the root colonization of PGPR, and this effect could be neutralized by the NO-specific scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy-3-oxide.
