26296568	10.1099/ijsem.0.000441	Bacillus paralicheniformis sp. nov., isolated from fermented soybean paste.	An isolate of a Gram-stain-positive, facultatively anaerobic, motile, rod-shaped, endospore-forming bacterium was recovered from soybean-based fermented paste. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene indicated that the strain was most closely related to Bacillus sonorensis KCTC-13918T (99.5...% similarity) and Bacillus licheniformis DSM 13T (99.4...%). In phenotypic characterization, the novel strain was found to grow at 15...60.....C and to tolerate up to 10...% (w/v) NaCl. Furthermore, the strain grew in media with pH...6...11 (optimal growth at pH...7.0...8.0). The predominant cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15...:...0 (37.7...%) and iso-C15...:...0 (31.5...%). The predominant isoprenoid quinone was menaquinone 7 (MK-7). The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. A draft genome sequence of the strain was completed and used for phylogenetic analysis.

27450592	10.1099/mic.0.000340	Formicin - a novel broad-spectrum two-component lantibiotic produced by Bacillus paralicheniformis APC 1576.	Bacteriocins represent a rather underutilized class of antimicrobials despite often displaying activity against many drug-resistant pathogens. Lantibiotics are a post-translationally modified class of bacteriocins, characterized by the presence of lanthionine and methyllanthionine bridges. In this study, a novel two-peptide lantibiotic was isolated and characterized. Formicin was isolated from Bacillus paralicheniformis APC 1576, an antimicrobial-producing strain originally isolated from the intestine of a mackerel. Genome sequencing allowed for the detection of the formicin operon and, from this, the formicin structural genes were identified, along with those involved in lantibiotic modification, transport and immunity. The identified bacteriocin was subsequently purified from the bacterial supernatant. Despite the degree of conservation seen amongst the entire class of two-peptide lantibiotics, the formicin peptides are unique in many respects.

The evolutionary pressure imposed by phage predation on bacteria and archaea has resulted in the development of effective anti-phage defence mechanisms, including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas..systems. Here, we report on a new defence system, DISARM (defence island system associated with restriction-modification), which is widespread in bacteria and archaea. DISARM is composed of five genes, including a DNA methylase and four other genes annotated as a helicase domain, a phospholipase..D (PLD) domain, a DUF1998 domain and a gene of unknown function. Engineering the Bacillus paralicheniformis 9945a DISARM system into Bacillus subtilis has rendered the engineered bacteria protected against phages from all three major families of tailed double-stranded DNA phages. Using a series of gene deletions, we show that four of the five genes are essential for DISARM-mediated defence, with the fifth (PLD) being redundant for defence against some of the phages.

Instead of using existing methods to chemically synthesize elemental selenium particles (CheSePs), which first require separating and purifying polysaccharides or proteins and adding extra reducing agent, this study applied a novel method to directly assemble exopolysaccharide-capped biogenic elemental selenium particles (EPS-BioSePs) by Bacillus paralicheniformis SR14 during the metabolic process. Characterization by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), size measurement and chemical composition analysis verified that EPS-BioSePs exhibited a monodispersed and homogeneous spherical structure 293.73..4.03nm in size.

28646111	10.1128/AEM.01258-17	A Bacillus paralicheniformis Iron-Containing Urease Reduces Urea Concentrations in Rice Wine.	Urease, a nickel-containing metalloenzyme, was the first enzyme to be crystallized and has a prominent position in the history of biochemistry. In the present study, we identified a nickel urease gene cluster, ureABCEFGDH, in Bacillus paralicheniformis ATCC 9945a and characterized it in Escherichia coli Enzymatic assays demonstrate that this oxygen-stable urease is also an iron-containing acid urease. Heterologous expression assays of UreH suggest that this accessory protein is involved in the transmembrane transportation of nickel and iron ions. Moreover, this iron-containing acid urease has a potential application in the degradation of urea in rice wine. The present study not only enhances our understanding of the mechanism of activation of urease but also provides insight into the evolution of metalloenzymes.IMPORTANCE An iron-containing, oxygen-stable acid urease from B. paralicheniformis ATCC 9945a with good enzymatic properties was characterized	2018	1	16	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	UreH; acid urease; ethyl carbamate; iron-containing urease; metal transporter; urea; Bacillus; Bacterial Proteins; Iron; Nickel; Oryza; Urea; Urease; Wine	Liu	Qingtao

30450906	10.1021/acs.jafc.8b04566	Molecular Engineering of Bacillus paralicheniformis Acid Urease To Degrade Urea and Ethyl Carbamate in Model Chinese Rice Wine.	Bacillus paralicheniformis urease (BpUrease) has been shown to be a promising biocatalyst for degrading the carcinogenic chemical ethyl carbamate (EC or urethane) in rice wine. However, low EC affinity and catalytic efficiency limit the practical application of BpUrease. In this study, we improved the EC degradation capability of BpUrease by site-saturation mutagenesis (SSM). The best variant L253P/L287N showed a 49% increase in EC affinity, 1027% increase in catalytic efficiency ( kcat/ Km), and 583% increase in half-life ( t1/2) at 70 ..C. Homology modeling analysis suggest that mutation of Leu253 to Pro increased the BpUrease EC specificity by affecting the interaction between Arg339 with the catalytic residue His323, while Leu287Asn mutation benefits EC specificity and affinity by changing the interaction networks among the residues in the catalytic pocket. Our results show that the L253P/L287N variant efficiently degraded urea and EC in a model ric	2019	4	22	J Agric Food Chem	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	affinity; catalytic efficiency; ethyl carbamate; protein engineering; rice wine; urea; urease; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacillus; Carcinogens; Catalysis; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oryza; Structure-Activity Relationship; Urea; Urease; Urethane; Wine	Liu	Qingtao
30394048	10.4014/jmb.1809.09030	Urease Characteristics and Phylogenetic Status of <i>Bacillus paralicheniformis</i>.	In 2015, Bacillus paralicheniformis was separated from B. licheniformis on the basis of phylogenomic and phylogenetic studies, and urease activity was reported as a phenotypic property able to differentiate between the two species. Subsequently, we have found that the urease activity of B. paralicheniformis is strain-specific, and does not reliably discriminate between species, as strains having the same urease gene cluster were identified in B. licheniformis and B. sonorensis, the closest relatives of B. paralicheniformis. We developed a multilocus sequence typing scheme using eight housekeeping genes, adk, ccpA, glpF, gmk, ilvD, pur, spo0A, and tpi to clearly identify B. paralicheniformis from closely related Bacillus species and to find a molecular marker for the rapid identification of B. paralicheniformis.

30030233	10.1128/AEM.01108-18	Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and Tentative Epidemiological Cutoff Values for Five Bacillus Species Relevant for Use as Animal Feed Additives or for Plant Protection.	Bacillus megaterium (n = 29), Bacillus velezensis (n = 26), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (n = 6), Bacillus paralicheniformis (n = 28), and Bacillus licheniformis (n = 35) strains from different sources, origins, and time periods were tested for the MICs for nine antimicrobial agents by the CLSI-recommended method (Mueller-Hinton broth, 35..C, for 18 to 20 h), as well as with a modified CLSI method (Iso-Sensitest [IST] broth, 37..C [35..C for B. megaterium], 24 h). This allows a proposal of species-specific epidemiological cutoff values (ECOFFs) for the interpretation of antimicrobial resistance in these species. MICs determined by the modified CLSI method were 2- to 16-fold higher than with the CLSI-recommended method for several antimicrobials. The MIC distributions differed between species for five of the nine antimicrobials.

The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize lead (Pb)-solubilizing bacteria from heavy metal-contaminated mine soils and to evaluate their inoculation effects on the growth and Pb absorption of Brassica juncea. The isolates were also evaluated for their plant growth-promoting characteristics as well as heavy metal and salt tolerance. A total of 171 Pb-tolerant isolates were identified, of which only 15 bacterial strains were able to produce clear haloes in solid medium containing PbO or PbCO3, indicating Pb solubilization. All of these 15 strains were also able to dissolve the Pb minerals in a liquid medium, which was accompanied by significant decreases in pH values of the medium. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the Pb-solubilizing strains belonged to genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Brevibacterium, and Staphylococcus.

Recent advancements in the use of microbial cells for scalable production of industrial enzymes encourage exploring new environments for efficient microbial cell factories (MCFs). Here, through a comparison study, ten newly sequenced Bacillus species, isolated from the Rabigh Harbor Lagoon on the Red Sea shoreline, were evaluated for their potential use as MCFs. Phylogenetic analysis of 40 representative genomes with phylogenetic relevance, including the ten Red Sea species, showed that the Red Sea species come from several colonization events and are not the result of a single colonization followed by speciation. Moreover, clustering reactions in reconstruct metabolic networks of these Bacillus species revealed that three metabolic clades do not fit the phylogenetic tree, a sign of convergent evolution of the metabolism of these species in response to special environmental adaptation.

30703469	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.01.012	Food-grade expression of an iron-containing acid urease in Bacillus subtilis.	Enzymatic degradation of urea, the precursor of carcinogenic compound ethylcarbamate in rice wine, is always attractive. In the present study, we achieved high efficient production of Bacillus paralicheniformis iron-containing urease (Bp_Urease) in B. subtilis with the food-grade expression system. After reassembly of the urease gene cluster with inserting ribosome binding site (RBS), the production was increased from 38 U/L to 187 U/L. After altering the position of ureC and co-expressing the iron transporter encoding gene ureH, the activity was further increased to 1307 U/L. Eventually, the urease production was improved to 21,964 U/L in 3-L fermentor, which is the highest reported value to date. Food-grade production of the iron-containing urease would be favorable to the practical applications in food industries.	2019	5	13	J Biotechnol	Journal of biotechnology	Bacillus subtilis; Fed-batch fermentation; Food-grade expression; Iron-containing urease; UreC; UreH; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Food; Iron; Urease	Liu	Qingtao

Whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic testing of 104 strains of Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus paralicheniformis from a variety of sources and time periods was used to characterize the genetic background and evolution of (putative) antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Core proteins were identified in draft genomes and a phylogenetic analysis based on single amino acid polymorphisms allowed the species to be separated into two phylogenetically distinct clades with one outlier. Putative antimicrobial resistance genes were identified and mapped. A chromosomal ermD gene was found at the same location in all B. paralichenformis and in 27% of B. licheniformis genomes. Erythromycin resistance correlated very well with the presence of ermD. The putative streptomycin resistance genes, aph and aadK, were found in the chromosome of all strains as adjacent loci.

30609921	10.1186/s12934-018-1049-x	Combinatorial pathway enzyme engineering and host engineering overcomes pyruvate overflow and enhances overproduction of N-acetylglucosamine in Bacillus subtilis.	Glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA1) is the key enzyme that causes overproduction of N-acetylglucosamine in Bacillus subtilis. Previously, we increased GlcNAc production by promoting the expression of GNA1 from Caenorhabditis elegans (CeGNA1) in an engineered B. subtilis strain BSGN12. In this strain overflow metabolism to by-products acetoin and acetate had been blocked by mutations, however pyruvate accumulated as an overflow metabolite. Although overexpression of CeGNA1 drove carbon flux from pyruvate to the GlcNAc synthesis pathway and decreased pyruvate accumulation, the residual pyruvate reduced the intracellular pH, resulting in inhibited CeGNA1 activity and limited GlcNAc production. In this study, we attempted to further overcome pyruvate overflow by enzyme engineering and host engineering for enhanced GlcNAc production. To this end, the key enzyme CeGNA1 was evolved through error-prone PCR under pyruvate stress to enhance its catalytic activity.

As close relatives, Bacillus paralicheniformis is often wrongly identified as Bacillus licheniformis. In this study, two genetic markers are presented based on fenC and fenD from the fengycin operon of B. paralicheniformis to rapidly distinguish it from B. licheniformis. The fengycin operon is one of the few present in B. paralicheniformis but absent in B. lichenformis up to date. Using these markers, two presumptive B. paralicheniformis isolates each were recovered from a set of isolates previously identified as B. licheniformis by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) or identified only to genus level as Bacillus by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing, respectively.

33058974	10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.10.025	Characterization of the starch surface binding site on Bacillus paralicheniformis ..-amylase.	..-Amylase from Bacillus paralicheniformis (BliAmy), belonging to GH13_5 subfamily of glycoside hydrolases, was proven to be a highly efficient raw starch digesting enzyme. The ability of some ..-amylases to hydrolyze raw starch is related to the existence of surface binding sites (SBSs) for polysaccharides that can be distant from the active site. Crystallographic studies performed on BliAmy in the apo form and of enzyme bound with different oligosaccharides and oligosaccharide precursors revealed binding of these ligands to one SBS with two amino acids F257 and Y358 mainly involved in complex formation. The role of this SBS in starch binding and degradation was probed by designing enzyme variants mutated in this region (F257A and Y358A). Kinetic studies with different substrates show that starch binding through the SBS is disrupted in the mutants and that F257 and Y358 contributed cumulatively to binding and hydrolysis. Mutation of both sites (F257A/Y358A) resulted in a 5-fold lower 	2021	4	8	Int J Biol Macromol	International journal of biological macromolecules	Crystal structure; Mutant; Starch; Surface binding site; ..-Amylase; Bacillus; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Glycoside Hydrolases; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Oligosaccharides; Starch; Substrate Specificity; Surface Properties; alpha-Amylases	Bo..i..

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the putative biocontrol agents (PBA) Bacillus paralicheniformis and Trichoderma asperelloides in vitro and in vivo to control two of the most important tomato plant diseases: vascular wilt (Fusarium oxysporum) and early blight (Alternaria alternata). The assessment of the in vitro interactions between the PBA and the phytopathogenic fungi was performed by dual confrontation assays. The biocontrol effectiveness of the individual and combined PBA treatments towards individual phytopathogen inoculations was evaluated in tomato plants. T. asperelloides was able to exert an outstanding mycoparasitic effect on both phytopathogenic fungi in the in vitro tests by hyphal strangulation and penetration. In addition, the individual PBA treatments were effective in the biocontrol of A. alternata and F. oxysporum in tomato plants reducing the plant disease severity in more than 53.8 and 66.7% for each of the pathogens, respectively.

Thermophilic bacteria, especially from the genus Bacillus, constitute a huge potential source of novel enzymes that could be relevant for biotechnological applications. In this work, we described the cellulose and hemicellulose-related enzymatic activities of the hot spring Bacillus aerius CCMM B940 from the Moroccan Coordinated Collections of Microorganisms (CCMM), and revealed its potential for hemicellulosic biomass utilization. Indeed, B940 was able to degrade complex polysaccharides such as xylan and lichenan and exhibited activity towards carboxymethylcellulose. The strain was also able to grow on agriculture waste such as orange and apple peels as the sole carbon source. Whole-genome sequencing allowed the reclassification of CCMM B940 previously known as B. aerius into Bacillus paralicheniformis since the former species name has been rejected.

The qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach was developed to provide a regularly updated generic pre-evaluation of the safety of biological agents, intended for addition to food or feed, to support the work of EFSA's Scientific Panels. The QPS approach is based on an assessment of published data for each agent, with respect to its taxonomic identity, the body of relevant knowledge, safety concerns and occurrence of antimicrobial resistance. Safety concerns identified for a taxonomic unit (TU) are, where possible, confirmed at the species/strain or product level and reflected by 'qualifications'. In the period covered by this statement, no new information was found that would change the status of previously recommended QPS TUs. Schizochytrium limacinum, which is a synonym for Aurantiochytrium limacinum, was added to the QPS list.

Food waste (FW) minimization at the source by using food waste biodigester (FWBs) has a vast potential to lower down the impact of increasing organic fraction in municipal solid waste generation. To this end, this research sought to check the performance of locally isolated hydrolase-producing bacteria (HPB) to improve food waste biodegradation rate. Two under-explored HPB identified as Bacillus paralicheniformis GRA2 and Bacillus velezensis TAP5 were able to produce maximum amylase, cellulase, protease and lipase activities, and demonstrated a significant hydrolase synergy in co-culture fermentation. In vitro biodegradation analysis of both autoclaved and non-autoclaved FW revealed that the HPB inoculation was effective to degrade total solids (&gt;62%), protein (&gt;19%), total fat (&gt;51), total sugar (&gt;86%), reducing sugar (&gt;38%) and starch (&gt;50%) after 8-day incubation.
