22039003	10.1099/ijs.0.032342-0	Brevibacillus nitrificans sp. nov., a nitrifying bacterium isolated from a microbiological agent for enhancing microbial digestion in sewage treatment tanks.	A heterotrophic nitrifying bacterium, designated strain DA2(T), was isolated from a microbiological agent for enhancing microbial digestion in sewage treatment tanks. Cells of strain DA2(T) were Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, sporulating rods that were motile by means of peritrichous flagella; they were able to grow at pH 5-8. The major isoprenoid quinone of strain DA2(T) was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and its cellular fatty acid profile consisted mainly of iso-C(15 : 0) (18.6 %) and anteiso-C(15 : 0) (69.1 %). The DNA G+C content was 54.1 mol%. 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny suggested that strain DA2(T) is a member of the genus Brevibacillus, with highest sequence similarities (in parentheses) to the type strains of Brevibacillus choshinensis (99.7 %), B. formosus (99.4 %), B. brevis (99.4 %), B. agri (99.0 %), B. reuszeri (98.8 %), B. parabrevis (98.7 %), B. centrosporus (98.6 %), B. limnophilus (97.4 %), B. panacihumi (97.3 %) and B. invocatus (97.3 %).

30947032	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.03.081	Plant-microbiome assisted and biochar-amended remediation of heavy metals and polyaromatic compounds ... a microcosmic study.	The study has been carried out to develop a plant-microbes assisted remediation technology to accelerate polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degradation and heavy metals (HMs) removal in a microcosmic experiment. The quaternary mixture of PAHs (phenanthrene, anthracene, pyrene, and benzo[a] pyrene) and metals (Cr, Ni, and Pb) spiked the soil, constructing a microcosm; the microcosms were bioaugmented with newly developed plant bacterial consortia (Cpm1 and Cpm2). The microcosms were amended with biochar (sieved particle size 0.5-2...mm) as redox regulators to reduce oxidative stress of plant-microbe systems. To formulate the two plant-bacterial consortia, plant species were collected and bacteria were isolated from oil spill soil. The bacterial strains used in two formulated consortia includes ...

36070852	10.1016/j.gene.2022.146853	Insights into the biodegradation and heavy metal resistance potential of the genus Brevibacillus through comparative genome analyses.	Members of the genus Brevibacillus belonging to the familyPaenibacillaceae are Gram-positive/variable, endospore-forming, and rod-shaped bacteria that dwell in various environmental habitats. Brevibacillus spp. have a wide range of enzyme activities such as degradation of various carbohydrates, plastics, and they possess resistance against heavy metals. These characteristics make them encouraging contenders for biotechnological applications.In this work, we analyzed the reference genomes of 19Brevibacillusspecies, focusing on discovering the biodegradation and heavy metal resistance capabilities of this little studied genus from genomic data. The results indicate that several strain specific traits were identified. For example Brevibacillus halotolerans s-14, and Brevibacillus laterosporus DSM 25 have more glycoside hydrolases (GHs) compared to other carbohydrate-active enzymes, and therefore might be more suitable for biodegradation of carbohydrates. In contrast, strains such as Brevi	2022	9	28	Gene	Gene	Biodegradation; Biotechnological applications; Brevibacillus; CAZymes; Heavy metal resistance; Polyurethane degradation; Biodegradation, Environmental; Brevibacillus; Carbohydrates; DNA, Bacterial; Glycoside Hydrolases; Metals, Heavy; Phylogeny; Polyurethanes; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology	Rasool Kamli	Majid
