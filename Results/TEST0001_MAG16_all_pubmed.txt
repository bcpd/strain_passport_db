19622642	10.1099/ijs.0.009126-0	Phylogeny and molecular taxonomy of the Bacillus subtilis species complex and description of Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum subsp. nov.	The Bacillus subtilis species complex is a tight assemblage of closely related species. For many years, it has been recognized that these species cannot be differentiated on the basis of phenotypic characteristics. Recently, it has been shown that phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene also fails to differentiate species within the complex due to the highly conserved nature of the gene, yet DNA-DNA hybridization values fall well below 70 % for the same species comparisons. As a complementary approach, we propose that phylogenetic analysis of multiple protein-coding loci can be used as a means to detect and differentiate novel Bacillus taxa. Indeed, our phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of a previously unknown group of strains closely related to, but distinct from, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii. Results of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the group produces a novel surfactin-like lipopeptide with mas	2009	12	1	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Typing Techniques; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S	Rooney	Alejandro P
24231292	10.1016/j.syapm.2013.09.006	Genomic insights into the taxonomic status of the three subspecies of Bacillus subtilis.	Bacillus subtilis contains three subspecies, i.e., subspecies subtilis, spizizenii, and inaquosorum. As these subspecies are phenotypically indistinguishable, their differentiation has relied on phylogenetic analysis of multiple protein-coding gene sequences. B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum is a recently proposed taxon that encompasses strain KCTC 13429(T) and related strains, which were previously classified as members of subspecies spizizenii. However, DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) values among the three subspecies raised a question as to their independence. Thus, we evaluated the taxonomic status of subspecies inaquosorum using genome-based comparative analysis. In contrast to the previous experimental values of DDH, the inter-genomic relatedness inferred by average nucleotide identity (ANI) values indicated that subspecies inaquosorum and spizizenii were sufficiently different from subspecies subtilis and hence raised the possibility that the former two could be classified as separate	2014	10	17	Syst Appl Microbiol	Systematic and applied microbiology	ANI; Bacillus subtilis; Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum; Comparative genomics; Subtilin; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteriocins; Biosynthetic Pathways; Genetic Variation; Genome, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Yi	Hana

Disease prevention is a key aspect in developing cryopreservation procedures for fish sperm and in improving the reproductive biotechnology for commercially important aquatic species. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an antibiotic supplementation (0.25% penicillin-streptomycin, PS and 0.25% penicillin-gentamicin, PG) on sperm motility and viability, bacterial profile and fertilization capacity of cryopreserved silver barb (Barbodes gonionotus) semen. The experimental protocol involved three treatments: addition of PS alone; addition of PG alone; and no addition of antibiotics (Control). Semen samples were frozen and cryostored for 12-mo. Administration of 0.25% PS significantly (P&lt;0.05) improved sperm motility and viability and reduced (P&lt;0.05) total heterotrophic bacteria, Gram negative bacteria and pseudomonads bacteria in cryopreserved semen.

A strain of bacteria in the Bacillus subtilis species complex was isolated from a building's air vent in the Washington DC area, USA, and produced strong antifungal activity with in vitro assays. This strain, designated (HU Biol-II), showed pronounced inhibitory effects on mycelial growth of a wide spectrum of fungi. The objectives of this study were to use genome sequencing to confirm the taxonomy of HU Biol-II, evaluate its antifungal activity and implement genome mining and HPLC-MS/MS to characterize the bioactive secondary metabolites. The strain, as determined by multilocus sequence alignment analysis, was identified as a member of Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum clade. Core genome phylogeny showed that the isolate is most closely related to B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum strain DE111, a commercially produced human probiotic.

It is well known that microorganisms can reduce the effectiveness of organophosphate pesticides after their application. But, little information is available concerning the effect of rice endophytic bacteria on the degradation of diazinon, an organophosphate pesticide used in control of the rice stem-borer, absorbed by the rice plant. Thus, aim of this study was to characterize the endophytic bacterial isolates, isolated from diazinon-treated and non-treated rice plants in paddy fields, in terms of diazinon degradation and to investigate whether potent isolates that degrade diazinon in..vitro might have the same effect in the rice plant. The results showed that all endophytic isolates, isolated from both groups of rice plants (diazinon-treated and non-treated rice plants), could grow in mineral salt medium (MSM) supplemented with diazinon (20..mg..L<sup>-1</sup>) as a sole carbon source, and 3.79-58.52% of the initial dose of the insecticide was degraded by the isolates within 14..d of	2020	4	17	Chemosphere	Chemosphere	Bacillus; Bioremediation; Diazinon...degrading endophytes; Endophyte...host interaction; Organophosphorus insecticides; Animals; Biodegradation, Environmental; Diazinon; Endophytes; Insecticides; Oryza; Phylogeny	Nasrollahi	Mina

31721032	10.1007/s10482-019-01354-9	Promotion of Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris to species status.	Bacillus subtilis currently encompasses four subspecies, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris. Several studies based on genomic comparisons have suggested these subspecies should be promoted to species status. Previously, one of the main reasons for leaving them as subspecies was the lack of distinguishing phenotypes. In this study, we used comparative genomics to determine the genes unique to each subspecies and used these to lead us to the unique phenotypes. The results show that one difference among the subspecies is they produce different bioactive secondary metabolites. B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii is shown conserve the genes to produce mycosubtilin, bacillaene and 3,3'-neotrehalosadiamine. B. subtilis subsp. inaquosorum is shown conserve the genes to produce bacillomycin F, fengycin and an unknown PKS/NRPS cluster.

The Bacillus subtilis group comprises species known for their ability to produce a wide variety of antimicrobial peptides. This work focuses on bacilysin, a broad-spectrum active dipeptide, and its prevalence in the B. subtilis group. In silico genome analysis of strains from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus velezensis, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus pumilus and B. subtilis subspecies inaquosorum, spizizenii and subtilis revealed that the bacilysin gene cluster is present in all species except for B. licheniformis. This observation was corroborated by PCR detection of the bacilysin genetic determinants on a collection of 168 food and environmental strains from the B. subtilis group. Phylogenetic analyses also demonstrated that the bacilysin gene cluster sequence showed more than 80 % identity within each species of the B. subtilis group.

Furthermore, B. inaquosorum KNUAS016 and L. brevis KNUAS017 also had the highest survival rates of 6.86 .. 0.02 and 5.37 .. 0.01 log10 CFU/mL, respectively, in a simulated intestinal fluid condition at 4 h of incubation. The percentage of autoaggregation at 6 h for L. sakei KNUAS019 (66.55 .. 0.33%), B. tequilensis KNUAS015 (64.56 .. 0.14%), and B. inaquosorum KNUAS016 (61.63 .. 0.19%) was &amp;gt;60%, whereas it was lower for L. brevis KNUAS017 (29.98 .. 0.09%)	2022	9	12	Int J Mol Sci	International journal of molecular sciences	Korean fermented food; antibacterial; antibiotic susceptibility; antioxidant; gut-tolerance; hemolysis; probiotics; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antioxidants; Fermented Foods; Lactobacillus; Probiotics; Republic of Korea	Sathiyaseelan	Anbazhagan
35053135	10.3390/biology11010137	Perception of Biocontrol Potential of <i>Bacillus inaquosorum</i> KR2-7 against Tomato Fusarium Wilt through Merging Genome Mining with Chemical Analysis.	Tomato Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol), is a destructive disease that threatens the agricultural production of tomatoes. In the present study, the biocontrol potential of strain KR2-7 against Fol was investigated through integrated genome mining and chemical analysis. Strain KR2-7 was identified as B. inaquosorum based on phylogenetic analysis. Through the genome mining of strain KR2-7, we identified nine antifungal and antibacterial compound biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) including fengycin, surfactin and Bacillomycin F, bacillaene, macrolactin, sporulation killing factor (skf), subtilosin A, bacilysin, and bacillibactin. The corresponding compounds were confirmed through MALDI-TOF-MS chemical analysis. The gene/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion, and induced systemic resistance were also identified in the KR2-7 genome, and their related secondary metabolites were detected.
