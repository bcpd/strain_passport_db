11928962	10.1017/s002202990100509x	L-methionine degradation potentialities of cheese-ripening microorganisms.	Volatile sulphur compounds are major flavouring compounds in many traditional fermented foods including cheeses. These compounds are products of the catabolism of L-methionine by cheese-ripening microorganisms. The diversity of L-methionine degradation by such microorganisms, however, remains to be characterized. The objective of this work was to compare the capacities to produce volatile sulphur compounds by five yeasts, Geotrichum candidum, Yarrowia lipolytica, Kluyveromyces lactis, Debaryomyces hansenii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and five bacteria, Brevibacterium linens, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Arthrobacter sp., Micrococcus lutens and Staphylococcus equorum of technological interest for cheese-ripening. The ability of whole cells of these microorganisms to generate volatile sulphur compounds from L-methionine was compared. The microorganisms produced a wide spectrum of sulphur compounds including methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide, dimethyltrisulfide and also S-meth	2002	8	30	J Dairy Res	The Journal of dairy research	Arthrobacter; Brevibacterium; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; Cheese; Corynebacterium; Fermentation; Geotrichum; Kluyveromyces; Methionine; Micrococcus luteus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Staphylococcus; Sulfur Compounds; Transaminases; Volatilization; Yarrowia	Bonnarme	P

Phenanthrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, becomes increasingly unavailable to microorganisms for degradation as it ages in soil. Consequently, many bioaugmentation efforts to remediate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in soil have failed. We studied the effect of repeatedly inoculating a soil with a phenanthrene-degrading Arthrobacter sp. on the mineralization kinetics of low concentrations of phenanthrene. After the first inoculation, the initial mineralization rate of 50 ng/g phenanthrene declined in a biphasic exponential pattern. By three hundred hours after inoculation, there was no difference in mineralization rates between the inoculated and uninoculated treatments even though a large fraction of the phenanthrene had not yet been mineralized. A second and third inoculation significantly increased the mineralization rate, suggesting that, though the mineralization rate declined, phenanthrene remained bioavailable. Restirring the soil, without inoculation, did not produce s	2002	8	5	Biodegradation	Biodegradation	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Feasibility Studies; Kinetics; Minerals; Phenanthrenes; Population; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Schwartz	E

Novel methylotrophic Arthrobacter and Hyphomicrobium species are described. Constitutive membrane-associated dimethylsulfone- and dimethylsulfoxide-reductases were found in Arthrobacter methylotrophus strain TGA and Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans strain S1. Enzyme activities increased during growth with dimethylsulfone or dimethylsulfoxide, respectively, and different ratios of activity with different growth substrates indicated that they are separate enzymes. SDS-PAGE showed some membrane-associated polypeptides to be enhanced during growth with dimethylsulfone (54 kDa in H. sulfonivorans, 21-24 kDa, 54 kDa and 80 kDa in A. methylotrophus). Western blotting with anti-dimethylsulfoxide-reductase antibody showed cross-reaction with 54- and 21-kDa polypeptides in A. methylotrophus. All strains contained rhodanese and sulfur oxygenase after growth with dimethylsulfone. Sulfite was oxidized in the Arthrobacter species by APS reductase and sulfite dehydrogenase.

Pseudomonas fluorescences 3 and Arthrobacter sp. 2 strains were isolated from the association of microorganisms--destructors of oil hydrocarbons and were selected for their ability to grow on media with phenanthrene as the only source of carbon and energy. The P. fluorescens 3 strain is able to grow on naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene. Arthrobacter sp. 2 strain did not grow on naphthalene, but was able to destruct phenanthrene and fluorene. The destruction activity of these strains both in pure and mixed culture towards the latter compounds has been studied. The both strains destructed phenanthrene added into the medium in the amount of 0.2 g/l, and phenanthrene destruction by Pseudomonas fluorescences 3 achieved 98.5% in 6 days and that by Arthrobacter sp. 93.5% in 23 days. Bacterial growth has been evaluated while measuring protein concentration in samples. Bacteria were inoculated in quantities equivalent to 0.0015-0.0020 mg protein/l.

The influence of plant growth promoting (PGP) activity of bacterial communities recovered from each of six weed species (barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusfalli (L.) Beauv.), corn spurrey (Spergula arvensis L.), goldenrod (Sonchus sp.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.), lamb's-quarters (Chenopodium album L.), and quack grass (Agropyron repens (L.) Beauv.)) was examined in relation to the effect it had on the growth of the potato cultivar Russet Burbank. Bacterial species composition and community structure were compared, species-abundance relationships were determined, and those members conferring positive benefits for potato growth and development were identified. Of the genera identified, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas were the most common, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the most frequent species recovered across all sources. Significantly higher population densities were found in the root zones of quack grass, compared with Itali	2002	6	11	Can J Microbiol	Canadian journal of microbiology	Agriculture; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Rhizobiaceae; Soil Microbiology; Solanum tuberosum; Species Specificity	Sturz	A V

A transposon mutagenesis system for Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis was developed based on antibiotic resistance transposons that were derived from the insertion element IS1409 from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013. As a prerequisite, the electroporation efficiency was optimized by using unmethylated DNA and treatment of the cells with glycine such that about 5 x 10(6) transformants per microg of DNA were generally obtained. Electroporation of C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis with a suicide vector carrying transposon Tn1409C resulted in approximately 1 x 10(3) transposon mutants per pg of DNA and thus is suitable for saturation mutagenesis. Analysis of Tn1409C insertion sites suggests a random mode of transposition. Transposition of Tn1409C was also demonstrated for other subspecies of C. michiganensis.	2002	6	3	Mol Plant Microbe Interact	Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI	Actinomycetales; DNA Transposable Elements; Electroporation; Genetic Vectors; Lycopersicon esculentum; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Plant Diseases	Kirchner	O
11714269	10.1021/bi0115479	Crystal structure and mechanism of catalysis of a pyrazinamidase from Pyrococcus horikoshii.	Bacterial pyrazinamidase (PZAase)/nicotinamidase converts pyrazinamide (PZA) to ammonia and pyrazinoic acid, which is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Loss of PZAase activity is the major mechanism of pyrazinamide-resistance by M. tuberculosis. We have determined the crystal structure of the gene product of Pyrococcus horikoshii 999 (PH999), a PZAase, and its complex with zinc ion by X-ray crystallography. The overall fold of PH999 is similar to that of N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase (CSHase) of Arthrobacter sp. and YcaC of Escherichia coli, a protein with unknown physiological function. The active site of PH999 was identified by structural features that are also present in the active sites of CSHase and YcaC: a triad (D10, K94, and C133) and a cis-peptide (between V128 and A129). Surprisingly, a metal ion-binding site was revealed in the active site and subsequently confirmed by crystal structure of PH999 in complex with Zn(2+).

The bacterial rhizosphere communities of three host plants of the pathogenic fungus Verticillium dahliae, field-grown strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), were analyzed. We aimed to determine the degree to which the rhizosphere effect is plant dependent and whether this effect would be increased by growing the same crops in two consecutive years. Rhizosphere or soil samples were taken five times over the vegetation periods. To allow a cultivation-independent analysis, total community DNA was extracted from the microbial pellet recovered from root or soil samples. 16S rDNA fragments amplified by PCR from soil or rhizosphere bacterium DNA were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The DGGE fingerprints showed plant-dependent shifts in the relative abundance of bacterial populations in the rhizosphere which became more pronounced in the second year.

AL-210 producing a novel levan fructotransferase (LFTase) was screened from soil samples. The LFTase was purified to homogeneity by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, column chromatography on Resource Q, and Superdex 200HR. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be approximately 46 kDa by both SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, and the enzyme's isoelectric point was pH 4.8. The major product produced from the levan hydrolysis by the enzyme reaction was identified by atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometry and NMR analysis as di-D-fructose-2,6':6,2'-dianhydride (DFA IV). The optimum pH and temperature for DFA IV production were 7.0 and 40 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at a pH range 7.0-8.0 and up to 40 degrees C. The enzyme activity was inhibited by FeCl2 and AgNO3. The enzyme converted the levan to DFA IV, with a conversion yield of approximately 44%. A gene encoding the LFTase (lftM) from Microbacterium sp.

11478261	10.1021/es000159b	Modeling of copper biosorption by Arthrobacter sp. in a UF/MF membrane reactor.	Copper biosorption by Arthrobacter sp. has been studied in this work. The process has been realized inside of a ultrafiltration/microfiltration (UF/MF) reactor in order to confine cells. A mathematical model has been developed that is able to predict experimental data under different operating conditions. The model takes into account different phenomena, which might occur during the process, such as a dependence of equilibrium parameters on pH, a partial cell disruption, and a change in the membrane retention properties at high biomass concentrations. Experimental tests have been performed under different operating conditions: a full factorial design has been implemented with pH (levels: 4, 5, and 6 units) and biomass concentration (levels: 1 and 5 g/L) as factors. A simple mathematical model based on metal mass balance taking into account the effect of pH on the Langmuir equilibrium adsorption parameters well fitted experimental data at low pH values and biomass concentrations.

A carbaryl hydrolase was purified to homogeneity from Arthrobacter sp. strain RC100 by protamine sulfate treatment, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and hydrophobic, anion-exchange, and gel filtration chromatographies. The native enzyme had a molecular mass of 100 kDa and was composed of two identical subunits with molecular masses of 51 kDa. The hydrolase activity was strongly inhibited by DIFP, PMSF, Hg(2+) and paraoxon but not by EDTA. The optimum pH and temperature for the enzyme activity were 9.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme hydrolyzed four N-methylcarbamate insecticides (carbaryl, xylylcarb, metolcarb and XMC), but was not able to hydrolyze fenobucarb, propoxur, and isoprocarb.	2001	8	16	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Arthrobacter; Carbaryl; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Edetic Acid; Enzyme Inhibitors; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Insecticides; Kinetics; Mercury; Molecular Weight; Paraoxon; Protease Inhibitors; Protein Subunits; Substrate Specificity; Temperature	Hayatsu	M

11428890	10.1006/jmbi.2001.4774	Modular structure, local flexibility and cold-activity of a novel chitobiase from a psychrophilic Antarctic bacterium.	The gene archb encoding for the cell-bound chitobiase from the Antarctic Gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter sp. TAD20 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble form. The mature chitobiase ArChb possesses four functionally independent domains: a catalytic domain stabilized by Ca(2+), a galactose-binding domain and an immunoglobulin-like domain followed by a cell-wall anchorage signal, typical of cell-surface proteins from Gram-positive bacteria. Binding of saccharides was analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry, allowing to distinguish unequivocally the catalytic domain from the galactose-binding domain and to study binding specificities. The results suggest that ArChb could play a role in bacterium attachment to natural hosts. Kinetic parameters of ArChb demonstrate perfect adaptation to catalysis at low temperatures, as shown by a low activation energy associated with unusually low K(m) and high k(cat) values. Thermodependence of these parameters indicates that	2001	7	26	J Mol Biol	Journal of molecular biology	Acetylglucosaminidase; Adaptation, Physiological; Antarctic Regions; Arthrobacter; Binding Sites; Calcium; Calorimetry, Differential Scanning; Catalytic Domain; Cold Temperature; Enzyme Activation; Galactose; Kinetics; Pliability; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Thermodynamics	Lonhienne	T

Although metals are thought to inhibit the ability of microorganisms to degrade organic pollutants, several microbial mechanisms of resistance to metal are known to exist. This study examined the potential of cadmium-resistant microorganisms to reduce soluble cadmium levels to enhance degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) under conditions of cocontamination. Four cadmium-resistant soil microorganisms were examined in this study. Resistant up to a cadmium concentration of 275 microg ml(-1), these isolates represented the common soil genera Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. Isolates Pseudomonas sp. strain H1 and Bacillus sp. strain H9 had a plasmid-dependent intracellular mechanism of cadmium detoxification, reducing soluble cadmium levels by 36%. Isolates Arthrobacter strain D9 and Pseudomonas strain I1a both produced an extracellular polymer layer that bound and reduced soluble cadmium levels by 22 and 11%, respectively.

An immunoseparation system for the separation of Listeria from enriched cheese samples was developed. The system utilizes polystyrene microbeads (3.8 microm in diameter) coated with covalently bound anti-Listeria genus-specific antibody. The beads were incubated with cheese enriched in half-Fraser broth and the bead-bacterial complex was separated by centrifugation at 110 g then spread on selective agar plates. Although cross-reactivity with certain Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Arthrobacter sp.) was determined, this had no negative effect on capture effectiveness of the beads to Listeria spp. The minimum density of Listeria cells positively detected by immunoseparation with subsequent plating was 10(0) cfu/ml. The application of the separation method facilitates a reduction in the time of Listeria detection in cheese by 2 days without affecting the sensitivity.	2001	8	23	J Microbiol Methods	Journal of microbiological methods	Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Centrifugation; Cheese; Colony Count, Microbial; Cross Reactions; Culture Media; Food Microbiology; Goats; Listeria; Listeria monocytogenes; Microspheres; Species Specificity	Kacl..kov..

Lactosucrose synthesis from sucrose and lactose was carried out by using beta-fructofuranosidase from Arthrobacter sp. K-1. The transfructosylation mechanism was found to be of an ordered bi-bi type in which sucrose was bound first to the enzyme and lactosucrose was released last. Hydrolysis side-reaction experiments indicated that the reactions were uncompetitively inhibited by glucose and lactose, while no inhibition by fructose was apparent. The overall reaction rates were formulated. The reaction rate constants, equilibrium constant, and dissociation and Michaelis constants were determined at 35 degrees C and 50 degrees C by fitting the experimental concentration changes with the calculated values by a nonlinear least-square method. The average relative derivation for the concentrations was 9.67%. The kinetic parameters were also calculated for 43 degrees C and 60 degrees C by assuming the Arrhenius law, and the course of reaction was predicted.

A new insertion element of 1,449 bp with 25-bp perfect terminal repeats, designated IS1409, was identified in the chromosome of 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading Arthrobacter sp. strain TM1 NCIB12013. Upon insertion, IS1409 causes a target duplication of 8 bp. IS1409 carries only a single open reading frame of 435 codons encoding the transposase TnpA. Both TnpA and the overall organization of IS1409 are highly similar to those of some related insertion elements of the ISL3 group (J. Mahillon and M. Chandler, Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 62:725--774, 1998). IS1409 was also found in other 4-chlorobenzoate-degrading Arthrobacter strains and Micrococcus luteus. Based on IS1409, a series of transposons carrying resistance genes for chloramphenicol and gentamicin were constructed. These transposons were used to demonstrate transposition events in vivo and to mutagenize Arthrobacter sp. strains.	2001	7	12	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Biodegradation, Environmental; Blotting, Southern; Chloramphenicol; Chlorobenzoates; Chromosomes, Bacterial; DNA Transposable Elements; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Electroporation; Gentamicins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Open Reading Frames; Transcription Factors	Gartemann	K H

Several 2-substituted benzoates (including 2-trifluoromethyl-, 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2-nitro-, 2-methoxy-, and 2-acetyl-benzoates) were converted by phthalate-grown Arthrobacter keyseri (formerly Micrococcus sp.) 12B to the corresponding 2-substituted 3,4-dihydroxybenzoates (protocatechuates). Because these products lack a carboxyl group at the 2 position, they were not substrates for the next enzyme of the phthalate catabolic pathway, 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate 2-decarboxylase, and accumulated. When these incubations were carried out in iron-containing minimal medium, the products formed colored chelates. This chromogenic response was subsequently used to identify recombinant Escherichia coli strains carrying genes encoding the responsible enzymes, phthalate 3,4-dioxygenase and 3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophthalate dehydrogenase, from the 130-kbp plasmid pRE1 of strain 12B.

The recombinant strain grew in medium containing 4-CBA and 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-CB) as the only source of carbon, with stoichiometric release of chloride and a molar growth yield on 4-CB that suggested utilization of both biphenyl rings. In resting cell assays, similar rates of degradation were observed for wild-type and recombinant strains for the most common eight congeners from the anaerobic dechlorination of Aroclor 1242, but the recombinant strain accumulated lower amounts of chlorinated meta-cleavage products and no 4-CBA.

Isothermal titration calorimetry has been applied to the determination of the kinetic parameters of chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) by monitoring the heat released during the hydrolysis of chitin glycosidic bonds. Experiments were carried out using two different macromolecular substrates: a soluble polymer of N-acetylglucosamine and the insoluble chitin from crab shells. Different experimental temperatures were used in order to compare the thermodependence of the activity of two chitinases from the psychrophile Arthrobacter sp.

Fifteen bacterial strains capable of utilizing naphthalene, phenanthrene, and biphenyl as the sole sources of carbon and energy were isolated from soils and bottom sediments contaminated with waste products generated by chemical and salt producing plants. Based on cultural, morphological, and chemotaxonomic characteristics, ten of these strains were identified as belonging to the genera Rhodococcus, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Pseudomonas. All ten strains were found to be halotolerant bacteria capable of growing in nutrient-rich media at NaCl concentrations of 1-1.5 M. With naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy, the strains could grow in a mineral medium with 1 M NaCl. Apart from being able to grow on naphthalene, six of the ten strains were able to grow on phenanthrene; three strains, on biphenyl; three strains, on octane; and one strain, on phenol. All of the strains were plasmid-bearing.

The selective effects of sulfur-containing hydrocarbons, with respect to changes in bacterial community structure and selection of desulfurizing organisms and genes, were studied in soil. Samples taken from a polluted field soil (A) along a concentration gradient of sulfurous oil and from soil microcosms treated with dibenzothiophene (DBT)-containing petroleum (FSL soil) were analyzed. Analyses included plate counts of total bacteria and of DBT utilizers, molecular community profiling via soil DNA-based PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), and detection of genes that encode enzymes involved in the desulfurization of hydrocarbons, i.e., dszA, dszB, and dszC.

Aminopropionaldehyde dehydrogenase was purified to apparent homogeneity from 1,3-diaminopropane-grown cells of Arthrobacter sp. TMP-1. The native molecular mass and the subunit molecular mass of the enzyme were approximately 20,5000 and 52,000, respectively, suggesting that the enzyme is a tetramer of identical subunits. The apparent Michaelis constant (K(m)) for 1,3-diaminopropane was approximately 3 microM. The enzyme equally used both NAD(+) and NADP(+) as coenzymes. The apparent K(m) values for NAD(+) and NADP(+) were 255 microM and 108 microM, respectively. The maximum reaction rates (V(max)) for NAD(+) and NADP(+) were 102 and 83.3 micromol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. Some tested aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic aldehydes were inert as substrates. The optimum pH was 8.0-8.5. The enzyme was sensitive to sulfhydryl group-modifying reagents.	2001	6	14	FEMS Microbiol Lett	FEMS microbiology letters	Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Aldehydes; Arthrobacter; Diamines; Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Repression; Enzyme Stability; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Molecular Weight; NAD; NADP; Protein Subunits; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; p-Chloromercuribenzoic Acid	Tanaka	K

In an attempt to investigate the molecular basis of pyrazinamide hydrolysis by the PncA protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we determined the pyrazinamidase activity of nine PncA mutants bearing a single amino acid substitution. Among them, three mutants (D8G, K96T and S104R) had virtually no activity (&lt; or =0.004 unit/mg), five (F13S, T61P, P69L, Y103S and A146V) retained a low level of activity (0.06-0.25 unit/mg) and one (T167L) exhibited a wild-type activity (1.51 units/mg). The possible structural effects of these substitutions were assessed by analysing a three-dimensional model of the PncA protein constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the N-carbamoylsarcosine amidohydrolase (CSHase) from Arthrobacter sp., an amidohydrolase which was found by hydrophobic cluster analysis to be closely related to PncA. In the PncA model, five of the mutated residues, Asp-8, Phe-13, Lys-96, Tyr-103 and Ser-104, were located within a 6 A sphere around the cysteine residue Cys-	2001	4	5	Biochem J	The Biochemical journal	Amidohydrolases; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; Molecular Sequence Data; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship	Lemaitre	N

Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20, a chitinolytic gram-positive organism, was isolated from the sea bottom along the Antarctic ice shell. Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20 secretes two major chitinases, ChiA and ChiB (ArChiA and ArChiB), in response to chitin induction. A single chromosomal DNA fragment containing the genes coding for both chitinases was cloned in Escherichia coli. DNA sequencing analysis of this fragment revealed two contiguous open reading frames coding for the precursors of ArChiA (881 amino acids [aa]) and ArChiB (578 aa). ArChiA and ArChiB are modular enzymes consisting of a glycosyl-hydrolase family 18 catalytic domain as well as two and one chitin-binding domains, respectively. The catalytic domain of ArChiA exhibits 55% identity with a chitodextrinase from Vibrio furnissii. The ArChiB catalytic domain exhibits 33% identity with chitinase A of Bacillus circulans. The ArChiA chitin-binding domains are homologous to the chitin-binding domain of ArChiB.

12557403		[The solubilization of four insoluble phosphates by some microorganisms].	Four insoluble phosphates of ferric phosphate (Fe-P), aluminum phosphate (Al-P), fluorapatite (FAP) and rock phosphate (RP) were used as a sole phosphorus resource for some phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms. It was found that there was significant difference in solubilizing these phosphates by the tested isolates. The fungi normally were more powerful than the bacteria in dissolving the phsophates. The microorganisms generally solubilized more phosphate when supplied with NO3- than with NH4+. However, the isolates of 2TCiF2 and 4TCiF6 had much higher capacity to solubilize FAP and Al-P respectively in NH4+ medium. Most of the isolates solubilized readily FAP and RP, and then Al-P. Ferric phosphate was the least soluble to these isolates. Only isolate 2TCiF2 showed strong ability to solubilize Fe-P. In particular, two Aspergillus sp. had much higher capacity of dissolving Fe-P when suppled with NO3-.

A Gram-positive, aerobic, spherical actinobacterium, designated strain 4-0(T), was isolated from a medieval wall painting and characterized to determine its taxonomic position. The peptidoglycan of strain 4-0(T) was of type A4alpha, with lysine as the diagnostic cell wall diamino acid and an interpeptide bridge of Lys-Gly-Glu. Its quinone system contained predominantly MK-9(H2) (64%) and its polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, four unknown glycolipids, two unknown phospholipids and an unknown lipid. The fatty acid profile of strain 4-0(T) was represented by significant amounts of ai-C15:0 and moderate amounts of ai-C17:0, i-C16:0 and i-C15:0 fatty acids. Spermidine was predominant in the polyamine pattern. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 68 mol%.

Phylogenetic analysis of bacterial L27 ribosomal proteins showed that, against taxonomy, the L27 protein from the Actinobacteria Arthrobacter sp. clusters with protein sequences from the Bacillus group. The L27 gene clusters in the Arthrobacter sp. genome with six genes responsible for creatinine and sarcosine degradation. Phylogenetic analyses of orthologue proteins encoded by three of these genes also showed a phylogenetic relationship with Bacillus species. Comparisons between the synonymous codon usage of the Arthrobacter sp. genes and those from complete genomes showed that Arthrobacter genes encoding the L27 ribosomal protein and the proteins responsible for the degradation of creatinine and sarcosine have a codon usage that is more similar to that of Bacillus species than that of Arthrobacter. We suggest that the Arthrobacter sp. genes encoding the L27 ribosomal protein and the proteins responsible for the degradation of creatinine and sarcosine were acquired simultaneously thro	2003	5	8	J Mol Evol	Journal of molecular evolution	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genes, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Ribosomal Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Garcia-Vallv..

The influence of grazing by a mixed assemblage of soil protozoa (seven flagellates and one amoeba) on bacterial community structure was studied in soil microcosms amended with a particulate resource (sterile wheat roots) or a soluble resource (a solution of various organic compounds). Sterilized soil was reinoculated with mixed soil bacteria (obtained by filtering and dilution) or with bacteria and protozoa. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR amplifications of 16S rRNA gene fragments, as well as community level physiological profiling (Biolog plates), suggested that the mixed protozoan community had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. Excising and sequencing of bands from the DGGE gels indicated that high-G+C gram-positive bacteria closely related to Arthrobacter spp. were favored by grazing, whereas the excised bands that decreased in intensity were related to gram-negative bacteria.

12093275	10.1021/bi0157722	The structure of L-hydantoinase from Arthobacter aurescens leads to an understanding of dihydropyrimidinase substrate and enantio specificity.	L-Hydantoinase from Arthrobacter aurescens (L-Hyd) is a member of the dihydropyrimidinases which in turn belong to the cyclic amidases. Dihydropyrimidinases catalyze the reversible hydrolytic ring opening of dihydropyrimidines as the second step in the catabolism of pyrimidines. In biotechnology, their hydroloytic activity on five-membered cyclic diamides (hydantoins) is used in the enantio-specific production of amino acids from racemic hydantoins. L-Hyd differs from most of the other dihydropyrimidinases by an L-enantio specificity and by lacking activity on possible natural substrates such as dihydropyrimidines. In this paper, we describe the three-dimensional structure of L-Hyd which was solved by molecular replacement using a homology model and subsequently refined to 2.6 A resolution. Each subunit of the tetrameric L-Hyd consists of an elliptically distorted (alpha/beta)(8)-barrel domain, which hosts the active site, and a beta-sheet domain.

The aim of this work was to determine the reactivity of furniture factory workers to microbial allergens associated with wood dust. Allergological examinations by skin and precipitin tests were performed in 48 workers employed in a factory producing furniture from fibreboards and chipboards, and in 32 healthy urban dwellers not exposed to organic dusts (referents). The skin test was performed by the intradermal method with the saline extracts of the cultures of 3 microbial species (Rahnella sp., Arthrobacter globiformis, Aspergillus fumigatus) associated with wood dust. Skin reactions were recorded after 20 minutes, 8 hours and 24 hours and graded 1-4, depending on the diameter of the reaction. The agar-gel test for the presence of precipitins in serum was performed with the extracts of 15 microbial isolates.

12054218	10.1099/00207713-52-3-1017	Arthrobacter roseus sp. nov., a psychrophilic bacterium isolated from an antarctic cyanobacterial mat sample.	Strain CMS 90rT, a red-pigmented bacterium, was isolated from a cyanobacterial mat sample from a pond located in McMurdo, Antarctica. Based on its chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic properties, strain CMS 90r(T) was identified as a member of group I of Arthrobacter. It shared 16S rDNA similarity of 98% with Arthrobacter oxydans ATCC 14358T and Arthrobacter polychromogenes ATCC 15216T, while DNA-DNA similarities determined for these three organisms were less than 70%. It also differed from all 17 reported Arthrobacter species with A3alpha-variant peptidoglycan in that it possessed a unique peptidoglycan (Lys-Gly-Ala3) and contained galactose, glucose, ribose and rhamnose as cell-wall sugars. These data and the presence of diagnostic phenotypic traits support the description of CMS 90r(T) as a novel species of Arthrobacter, for which the name Arthrobacter roseus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is strain CMS 90r(T) (= MTCC 3712T = DSM 14508T).	2003	1	7	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Antarctic Regions; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Biomass; DNA, Ribosomal; Fresh Water; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptidoglycan; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Pigments, Biological; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Temperature	Reddy	G S N

The dynamics of species composition of a hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteriocenosis of a ground suspension of Mozhaisk Reservoir has been studied. The bacteriocenosis was undergoing development in a paraffin film (model association composed of sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria). The type of bacterial succession did not depend on the depth, from which ground samples were collected. Two microbial species (Pseudomonas sp. and Arthrobacter globiformis) were absolutely dominant. Pseudomonas sp. was dominant at the early and intermediate stages of the succession, whereas A. globiformis was present in the hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteriocenosis throughout the whole period of the succession. There was a trend toward a gradual increase in the ratio of A. globiformis, and, by the end of the experiment, Pseudomonas sp. was replaced by A. globiformis almost completely.

A bacterial strain able to transform diuron was isolated from a soil by enrichment procedures. Strain isolation was realized by plating on minimal-agarose medium spread with this herbicide and selecting the colonies surrounded by a clear thin halo. One strain was characterized and identified as an Arthrobacter sp. It metabolized diuron and the final transformation product, 3,4-dichloroaniline, was produced in stoichiometric amounts. The transformation of diuron at different concentrations was more efficient in the presence of alternative sources of carbon and nitrogen. The bacterial activity was also evaluated in soil microcosms with a consequent disappearance of diuron and concomitant appearance of 3,4-dichloroaniline, of which the concentration decreased thereafter. Bacterial cells inoculated in the microcosms survived as viable but eventually nonculturable cells.	2002	7	26	Chemosphere	Chemosphere	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biotransformation; Diuron; Herbicides; Molecular Structure; Soil Pollutants	Widehem	Pascale

N2: structure, ecotoxicity and fate of diuron metabolite with soil fungi.	In order to assess the influence of the aromatic substitution on the ability of a soil bacterial strain, Arthrobacter sp. N2, to degrade phenylurea herbicides, biotransformation assays were performed in mineral medium with resting cells of this soil bacterial strain on three phenylurea herbicides (diuron, chlorotoluron and isoproturon). Each herbicide considered, led to the formation of only one metabolite detected by HPLC analysis. After isolation, the metabolites were identified by NMR and MS, as the corresponding substituted anilines. According to the Microtox test (realized on the bacterium Vibrio fischeri), these metabolites presented non-target toxicity far more important (up to 600 times higher for 4-isopropylaniline) than the parent molecule. For isoproturon and chlorotoluron, the amount of substituted anilines obtained at the end of the biotransformation was very low, whereas the biotransformation of diuron into 3,4-dichloroaniline was almost quantitative.

A bacterial strain (TA13) capable of utilizing t-anethole as the sole carbon source was isolated from soil. The strain was identified as Arthrobacter aurescens based on its 16 S rRNA gene sequence. Key steps of the degradation pathway of t-anethole were identified by the use of t-anethole-blocked mutants and specific inducible enzymatic activities. In addition to t-anethole, strain TA13 is capable of utilizing anisic acid, anisaldehyde, and anisic alcohol as the sole carbon source. t-Anethole-blocked mutants were obtained following mutagenesis and penicillin enrichment. Some of these blocked mutants, accumulated in the presence of t-anethole quantitative amounts of t-anethole-diol, anisic acid, and 4,6-dicarboxy-2-pyrone and traces of anisic alcohol and anisaldehyde. Enzymatic activities induced by t-anethole included: 4-methoxybenzoate O-demethylase, p-hydroxybenzoate 3-hydroxylase, and protocatechuate-4,5-dioxygenase.

Strain B51 capable of degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) was isolated from soil contaminated with wastes from the chemical industry. Based on its morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, the strain was identified as a Microbacterium sp. Experiments with washed cells showed that strain B51 is able to degrade ortho- and para-substituted mono-, di-, and trichlorinated biphenyls (MCB, DCB, and TCB, respectively). Unlike the known PCB degraders, Microbacterium sp. B51 is able to oxidize the ortho-chlorinated ring of 2,2'-DCB and 2,4'-DCB and the para-chlorinated ring of 4.4'-DCB. The degradation of 2,4'-DCB and 4,4'-DCB was associated with the accumulation of 4-chlorobenzoic acid (4-CBA) in the medium in amounts comprising 80-90% of the theoretical yield. The strain was able to utilize 2-MCB, 2,2'-DCB, and their intermediate 2-CBA and to oxidize the mono(ortho)-chlorinated ring of 2,4,2'-TCB and the di(ortho-para)-chlorinated ring of 2,4,4'-TCB.

Three strains of a previously undescribed, Gram-positive, coryneform bacterium, which were isolated from cattle, were subjected to polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the unknown isolates were members of the genus Arthrobacter and were phylogenetically closely related to Arthrobacter luteolus. However, DNA-DNA hybridization indicated that the strains belonged to a new sub-lineage within the genus Arthrobacter. The unknown isolates can be distinguished from related species by biochemical tests.

A distinct inhibition of the growth of a typical soil-born bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. PI/1-95, by aluminium was established. The content of intracellular water and (consequently) the cell size of the bacterium significantly increased when cells came into contact with aluminium. Both parameters were also increased when applying HCl, but Al caused the greater change, so that a distinct discrimination between the effects of aluminium on the one hand and a sole pH-effect on the other hand was possible. The presented results point to an osmo-regulative disorder connected with a malfunction of cell membrane and cell wall, which seems to be a probable mechanism for an Al-toxicity in connection with Arthrobacter sp.

Propenylbenzenes are often used as starting materials in the chemical synthesis of aroma compounds and fine chemicals. In the present study, we demonstrate the ability of an Arthrobacter sp. to transform various structures of propenylbenzenes derived from essential oils to flavor, fragrance, and fine chemicals. Arthrobacter strain TA13 and its t-anethole blocked mutants (incapable of growing on t-anethole) converted isoeugenol to vanillin and vanillic acid; and safrole to hydroxychavicol. High conversion efficiencies were achieved in the biotransformations of isosafrole to piperonylic acid, and eugenol to a mixture of ferulic acid and vanillic acid. In addition, anisic acid was produced in high yields from t-anethole, anisyl alcohol, or anisaldehyde. The accumulation of the corresponding aromatic acids from the tested propenylbenzenes is due to the lack of m-demethylase activity in strain TA13 that prevents further cleavage of the benzene ring.

13130006	10.1099/ijs.0.02492-0	Arthrobacter koreensis sp. nov., a novel alkalitolerant bacterium from soil.	Two Arthrobacter strains, CA15-8(T) and CA15-9, were isolated from soil, under alkali conditions, and characterized phenotypically, chemotaxonomically and genetically. These alkalitolerant organisms grew over a wide pH range (pH 7.0-12.0), with an optimum at pH 7.0-8.0. The mean G+C content of the DNA of these strains was 63+/-2 mol%. The strains contained MK-8(H(2)) and MK-9(H(2)) as the main respiratory quinones. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was Lys-Thr-Ala(2) and the whole-cell sugar was rhamnose. The major cellular fatty acids of the isolates were anteiso-C(15 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0). A phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rDNA sequence data, revealed that strains CA15-8(T) and CA15-9 formed an evolutionary lineage distinct from other Arthrobacter species. On the basis of morphological, physiological and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S rDNA sequence comparisons and DNA-DNA hybridization data, a novel species of Arthrobacter is proposed, namely Arthrobacter koreensis (type strain C	2004	1	5	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Arthrobacter; Base Composition; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Fatty Acids; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Molecular Sequence Data; Peptidoglycan; Phenotype; Phylogeny; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology	Lee	Jung-Sook

A synthetic beta-thio-fructofuranoside of mercaptoethanol inhibited not only beta-fructofuranosidases but also alpha-glucosidases. The compound was hardly hydrolyzed by the glycosidases. The thio-fructoside competitively inhibited beta-fructofuranosidases from Aspergillus niger, Candida sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but not Arthrobacter beta-fructofuranosidase at all. Sucrase activity of rat intestinal sucrase/isomaltase complex was also suppressed in the presence of the thio-fructoside. The thio-fructoside showed noncompetitive inhibition toward maltase activity of the rat intestinal enzyme complex and Saccharomyces sp. alpha-glucosidase. Inhibition against the Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-glucosidase, Rhizopus glucoamylase, and porcine kidney trehalase were more slight than that against these two alpha-glucosidases.	2004	5	13	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry	Animals; Arthrobacter; Aspergillus niger; Binding, Competitive; Candida; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fructose; Geobacillus stearothermophilus; Glucan 1,4-alpha-Glucosidase; Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors; Hydrolysis; Intestines; Kinetics; Maltose; Rats; Rhizopus; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Sucrase; Sucrose; Sulfides; Swine; Trehalase; beta-Fructofuranosidase	Kiso	Taro

TAD20 has been expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant enzyme purified to homogeneity. In an effort to engineer cold-adapted biocatalysts through rational redesign to operate at elevated temperatures, we performed several mutations aiming to increase the rigidity of the molecular edifice of the selected psychrophilic chitinase. The mutations were designed on the basis of a homology-based three-dimensional model of the enzyme, and included an attempt to introduce a salt bridge (mutant N198K) and replacements of selected Gly residues by either Pro (mutants G93P, G254P) or Gln (G406Q). Mutant N198K resulted in a more stable protein (DeltaTm = 0.6 degrees C). Mutant G93P exhibited a DeltaTm of 1.2 degrees C, while mutants G254P and G406Q exhibited decreased stability.

Acid pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass releases furan and phenolic compounds, which are toxic to microorganisms used for subsequent fermentation. In this study, we isolated new microorganisms for depletion of inhibitors in lignocellulosic acid hydrolysates. A sequential enrichment strategy was used to isolate microorganisms from soil. Selection was carried out in a defined mineral medium containing a mixture of ferulic acid (5 mM), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF, 15 mM), and furfural (20 mM) as the carbon and energy sources, followed by an additional transfer into a corn stover hydrolysate (CSH) prepared using dilute acid. Subsequently, based on stable growth on these substrates, six isolates--including five bacteria related to Methylobacterium extorquens, Pseudomonas sp, Flavobacterium indologenes, Acinetobacter sp., Arthrobacter aurescens, and one fungus, Coniochaeta ligniaria--were chosen.

12907670	10.1074/jbc.M308198200	The structure of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from arthrobacter sp. strain SU.	The 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenation pathway in certain Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas bacterial species contains three enzymes: a ligase, a dehalogenase, and a thioesterase. Here we describe the high resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU. The tetrameric enzyme is a dimer of dimers with each subunit adopting the so-called "hot dog fold" composed of six strands of anti-parallel beta-sheet flanked on one side by a rather long alpha-helix. The dimers come together to form the tetramer with their alpha-helices facing outwards. This quaternary structure is in sharp contrast to that previously observed for the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Pseudomonas species strain CBS-3, whereby the dimers forming the tetramer pack with their alpha-helices projecting toward the interfacial region. In the Arthrobacter thioesterase, each of the four active sites is formed by three of the subunits of the tetramer.

12884086	10.1007/s00792-003-0338-3	Mode of action and antifungal properties of two cold-adapted chitinases.	The mode of action of two chitinases from the Antarctic Arthrobacter sp. strain TAD20 on N-acetyl-chitooligomers and chitin polymers has been elucidated. Identification of the length of chitin oligomers following enzymatic hydrolysis was verified by using HPLC-based analysis. It was observed that the length of the oligomer is important for enzyme action. The enzymes cannot effectively hydrolyze chitin oligomers with a degree of polymerization lower than four. ArChiA is an endochitinase which hydrolyzes chitin substrates randomly, whereas ArChiB is an exochitinase which degrades chitin chains and N-acetyl-chitooligomers from the nonreducing end, releasing N- N'-diacetyl-chitobiose. ArChiB (100 microg/ml) inhibited spore germination and hyphal elongation of the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea by 15% and 30%, respectively. A more pronounced effect was observed with ArChiA (100 microg/ml) resulting in 70% inhibition of spore germination and 60% inhibition of germ tube elongation.

A bacterium exhibiting activities of several inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)]- and ATP-dependent kinases, including glucokinase, NAD kinase, mannokinase, and fructokinase, was isolated, determined to belong to the genus Arthrobacter, and designated Arthrobacter sp. strain KM. Among the kinases, a novel enzyme responsible for the poly(P)- and ATP-dependent mannokinase activities was purified 2,200-fold to homogeneity from a cell extract of the bacterium. The purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 30 kDa. This enzyme phosphorylated glucose and mannose with a high affinity for glucose, utilizing poly(P) as well as ATP, and was designated poly(P)/ATP-glucomannokinase. The K(m) values of the enzyme for glucose, mannose, ATP, and hexametaphosphate were determined to be 0.50, 15, 0.20, and 0.02 mM, respectively.

A novel enzyme, D-3-hydroxyaspartate aldolase (D-HAA), catalyzing the conversion of D-3-hydroxyaspartate to glyoxylate plus glycine, was purified to homogeneity from Paracoccus denitrificans IFO 13301. D-HAA is strictly D-specific as to the alpha-position, whereas the enzyme does not distinguish between threo and erythro forms at the beta-position. In addition to D-3-hydroxyaspartate, the enzyme also acts on d-threonine, D-3-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, D-3-3,4-methylenedioxyphenylserine, and D-3-phenylserine. The D-HAA gene was cloned and sequenced. The gene contains an open reading frame consisting of 1,161 nucleotides corresponding to 387 amino acid residues. The predicted amino acid sequence displayed 35% and 22% identity with that of the D-threonine aldolase of Arthrobacter sp. DK-38 and Alcaligenes xylosoxidan IFO 12669, respectively.

An Arthrobacter sp. and a Bacillus sp., isolated from a long-term tannery waste contaminated soil, were examined for their tolerance to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and their ability to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), a detoxification process in cell suspensions and cell extracts. Both bacteria tolerated Cr(VI) at 100 mg/ml on a minimal salts agar medium supplemented with 0.5% glucose, but only Arthrobacter could grow in liquid medium at this concentration. Arthrobacter sp. could reduce Cr(VI) up to 50 microg/ml, while Bacillus sp. was not able to reduce Cr(VI) beyond 20 microg/ml. Arthrobacter sp. was distinctly superior to the Bacillus sp. in terms of their Cr(VI)-reducing ability and resistance to Cr(VI). Assays with permeabilized (treated with toluene or Triton X 100) cells and crude extracts demonstrated that the Cr(VI) reduction was mainly associated with the soluble protein fraction of the cell. Arthrobacter sp. has a great potential for bioremediation of Cr(VI)-containing waste.	2003	7	24	Curr Microbiol	Current microbiology	Arthrobacter; Bacillus; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromium; Culture Media; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Industrial Waste; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Tanning	Megharaj	M

Quorum sensing is a signalling mechanism that controls diverse biological functions, including virulence, via N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal molecules in Gram-negative bacteria. With the aim of isolating strains or enzymes capable of blocking quorum sensing by inactivating AHL, bacteria were screened for AHL degradation by their ability to utilize N-3-oxohexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (OHHL) as the sole carbon source. Among four isolates, strain IBN110, identified as Arthrobacter sp., was found to grow rapidly on OHHL, and to degrade various AHLs with different lengths and acyl side-chain substitutions. Co-culture of Arthrobacter sp. IBN110 and the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora significantly reduced both the AHL amount and pectate lyase activity in co-culture medium, suggesting the possibility of applying Arthrobacter sp.

D-Arginase activity was found in the cells of an isolate, Arthrobacter sp. KUJ 8602, grown in the L-arginine medium, and the enzyme was purified and characterized. Its molecular weight was estimated to be about 232,000 by gel filtration, and that of the subunit was approximately 40,000 by SDS-PAGE, suggesting that the enzyme is a homohexamer. The enzyme acted on not only D-arginine but also 4-guanidinobutyrate, 3-guanidinopropionate and even L-arginine. The V(max)/K(m) values for 4-guanidinobutyrate and D-arginine were determined to be 87 and 0.81 micro mol/min/mg/mM, respectively. Accordingly, the enzyme is regarded as a kind of guanidinobutyrase [EC 3.5.3.7]. The pH optima for 4-guanidinobutyrate and D-arginine were 9.0 and 9.5, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited competitively by 5-aminovalerate, and thiol carboxylates such as mercaptoacetate served as strong mixed-type inhibitors.

The Arthrobacter sp. strain SU 4-chlorobenzoate (4-CBA) dehalogenation pathway converts 4-CBA to 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HBA). The pathway operon contains the genes fcbA, fcbB, and fcbC (A. Schmitz, K. H. Gartemann, J. Fiedler, E. Grund, and R. Eichenlaub, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58:4068-4071, 1992). Genes fcbA and fcbB encode 4-CBA-coenzyme A (CoA) ligase and 4-CBA-CoA dehalogenase, respectively, whereas the function of fcbC is not known. We subcloned fcbC and expressed it in Escherichia coli, and we purified and characterized the FcbC protein. A substrate activity screen identified benzoyl-CoA thioesters as the most active substrates. Catalysis of 4-HBA-CoA hydrolysis to 4-HBA and CoA occurred with a k(cat) of 6.7 s(-1) and a K(m) of 1.2 micro M. The k(cat) pH rate profile for 4-HBA-CoA hydrolysis indicated optimal activity over a pH range of 6 to 10.

To isolate and characterize atrazine-degrading bacteria in order to identify suitable candidates for potential use in bioremediation of atrazine contamination. A high efficiency atrazine-degrading bacterium, strain AD1, which was capable of utilizing atrazine as a sole nitrogen source for growth, was isolated from industrial wastewater. 16S rDNA sequencing identified AD1 as an Arthrobacter sp. The atrazine chlorohydrolase gene (atzA) isolated from strain AD1 differed from that found in the Pseudomonas sp. ADP by only one nucleotide. However, it was found located on the bacterial chromosome rather than on plasmids as previously reported for other bacteria. Atrazine chlorohydrolase gene, atzA, either encoded by chromosome or plasmid, is highly conserved. Comparison analysis of atrazine degradation gene structure and arrangement in this and other bacteria provides insight into our understanding of the ecology and evolution of atrazine-degrading bacteria.	2003	6	13	Lett Appl Microbiol	Letters in applied microbiology	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; China; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrolases; Industrial Waste; Water Microbiology	Cai	B

All tests had the same feed composition except for the buffer intensity. It was found that Corynebacterium sp. seemed to prefer growing under lower buffer condition, and Arthrobacter sp. grew dominantly in the system with higher buffer intensity. Gram-negative bacteria appeared more sensitive to an environment with unstable organic loading, such as in the SBR system. On the contrary, the SBR system was more selective to the Gram-positive genera with a special rod-coccus-cycle characteristic, such as Arthrobacter, Corynebacterium, or Brevibacterium.	2003	9	16	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Agar; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Buffers; Culture Media; Sewage	Juang	D-F

Very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. We evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by using a combination of culture and molecular detection. Total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) CFU/g of material. Enteric bacteria such as Enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no Salmonella strains were detected by culture. In order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes amplified by PCR with microbial community DNA isolated from poultry litter as the template.

We describe herein the analysis of lake sediment contaminated with high concentrations of copper as a consequence of mine milling disposal over a 100-year period. Copper concentrations in the sediment were found to vary with depth and ranged from 200 to 5500 ppm. Analysis of the microbial community with T-RFLP identified a minimum of 20 operational taxonomic units (OTU). T-RFLP analysis along a depth profile detected as many as nine shared OTUs across 15 centimeters, suggesting a conservation of community structure over this range. Only two genera, Arthrobacter and Ralstonia, were detected among 50 aerobic copper-resistant isolates cultivated on R2A, one of which (Ralstonia sp.) was characterized by the sequestration of copper, identified by electron diffraction scanning, in growing colonies.

12486039	10.1128/JB.185.1.41-50.2003	Characterization of the 4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate aldolase gene and operon structure of the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway genes in Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6.	The protocatechuate (PCA) 4,5-cleavage pathway is the essential metabolic route for degradation of low-molecular-weight products derived from lignin by Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6. In the 10.5-kb EcoRI fragment carrying the genes for PCA 4,5-dioxygenase (ligAB), 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate hydrolase (ligI), 4-oxalomesaconate hydratase (ligJ), and a part of 4-carboxy-2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ligC), we found the ligK gene, which encodes 4-carboxy-4-hydroxy-2-oxoadipate (CHA) aldolase. The ligK gene was located 1,183 bp upstream of ligI and transcribed in the same direction as ligI. We also found the ligR gene encoding a LysR-type transcriptional activator, which was located 174 bp upstream of ligK. The ligK gene consists of a 684-bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide with a molecular mass of 24,131 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of ligK showed 57 to 88% identity with those of the corresponding genes recently reported in Sphingomonas sp. strain LB126,	2003	2	4	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Aldehyde-Lyases; Bacterial Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Hydroxybenzoates; Molecular Sequence Data; Operon; Oxaloacetic Acid; Pyruvic Acid; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sphingomonas	Hara	Hirofumi

16329913	10.1016/j.femsec.2004.11.012	Characterization of Arthrobacter nicotinovorans HIM, an atrazine-degrading bacterium, from agricultural soil New Zealand.	Arthrobacter nicotinovorans HIM was isolated directly from an agricultural sandy dune soil 6 months after a single application of atrazine. It grew in minimal medium with atrazine as sole nitrogen source but was unable to mineralize 14C-ring-labelled atrazine. Atrazine was degraded to cyanuric acid. In addition to atrazine the bacterium degraded simazine, terbuthylazine, propazine, cyanazine and prometryn but was unable to grow on terbumeton. When added to soil, A. nicotinovorans HIM did enhance mineralization of 14C-ring-labelled atrazine and simazine, in combination with naturally occurring cyanuric acid degrading microbes resident in the soil. Using PCR, the atrazine-degradation genes atzABC were identified in A. nicotinovorans HIM. Cloning of the atzABC genes revealed significant homology (&gt;99%) with the atrazine degradation genes of Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP. The atrazine degradation genes were held on a 96 kbp plasmid.	2005	12	30	FEMS Microbiol Ecol	FEMS microbiology ecology	Agriculture; Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Herbicides; New Zealand; Simazine; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Aislabie	Jackie

On the basis of phenotypic, genotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, a novel species belonging to the genus Arthrobacter is described. A facultatively psychrophilic bacterium, strain AG31(T), was isolated from an alpine ice cave. The aerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile strain exhibited a rod-coccus growth cycle and produced a yellow pigment. Good growth and phenol biodegradation occurred at a temperature range of 1-25 degrees C. Up to 10 mM phenol was utilized as a sole carbon source. Glucose was not assimilated. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that strain AG31(T) represents a distinct lineage within the genus Arthrobacter, being most closely related to Arthrobacter sulfureus. The level of DNA-DNA relatedness to the type strain of A. sulfureus was 29.9 %. Anteiso-C(15 : 0) was the predominant fatty acid (72 %).

15537343	10.1021/jm049957t	Fluorinated phenylcyclopropylamines. 2. Effects of aromatic ring substitution and of absolute configuration on inhibition of microbial tyramine oxidase.	A series of para-substituted diastereopure cis- and trans-2-fluoro-2-arylcyclopropylamines were synthesized and these were investigated as inhibitors of microbial tyramine oxidase from Arthrobacter sp. All compounds were shown to be competitive inhibitors of this enzyme. The nature of the para-substituents in the more potent trans-isomer (cis-relationship between fluorine and the amino group) of 2-fluoro-2-arylcyclopropylamine influenced the inhibitory potency in a consistent fashion. Thus, electron-withdrawing groups (F, Cl) slightly decreased the activity, while the methyl group (+ I substituent) increased the activity by a factor of ca. 7 compared to trans-2-fluoro-2-phenylcyclopropylamine and by a factor of 90 compared to tranylcypromine. Activity also was strongly dependent on the absolute configuration. The (1S,2S)-enantiomer of 2-fluoro-2-phenylcyclopropylamine was an excellent inhibitor of tyramine oxidase whereas the (1R,2R)-enantiomer was essentially devoid of activity.	2005	1	3	J Med Chem	Journal of medicinal chemistry	Arthrobacter; Crystallography, X-Ray; Molecular Structure; Monoamine Oxidase; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Propylamines; Stereoisomerism; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tranylcypromine	Rosen	Thomas C
15483318	10.1093/molbev/msi018	A functional screen identifies lateral transfer of beta-glucuronidase (gus) from bacteria to fungi.	Lateral gene transfer (LGT) from prokaryotes to microbial eukaryotes is usually detected by chance through genome-sequencing projects. Here, we explore a different, hypothesis-driven approach. We show that the fitness advantage associated with the transferred gene, typically invoked only in retrospect, can be used to design a functional screen capable of identifying postulated LGT cases. We hypothesized that beta-glucuronidase (gus) genes may be prone to LGT from bacteria to fungi (thought to lack gus) because this would enable fungi to utilize glucuronides in vertebrate urine as a carbon source. Using an enrichment procedure based on a glucose-releasing glucuronide analog (cellobiouronic acid), we isolated two gus(+) ascomycete fungi from soils (Penicillium canescens and Scopulariopsis sp.). A phylogenetic analysis suggested that their gus genes, as well as the gus genes identified in genomic sequences of the ascomycetes Aspergillus nidulans and Gibberella zeae, had been introgressed 	2005	6	21	Mol Biol Evol	Molecular biology and evolution	Amino Acid Sequence; Ascomycota; Bacteria; Fungi; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genes, Bacterial; Genes, Fungal; Glucuronidase; Gram-Positive Bacteria; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Sequence Alignment	Wenzl	Peter

To date, several 4-NP-degrading bacteria have been isolated; however, the genetic information remains very limited. In this study, a novel 4-NP degradation gene cluster from a gram-positive bacterium, Rhodococcus opacus SAO101, was identified and characterized. The deduced amino acid sequences of npcB, npcA, and npcC showed identity with phenol 2-hydroxylase component B (reductase, PheA2) of Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius A7 (32%), with 2,4,6-trichlorophenol monooxygenase (TcpA) of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (44%), and with hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase (ORF2) of Arthrobacter sp. strain BA-5-17 (76%), respectively. The npcB, npcA, and npcC genes were cloned into pET-17b to construct the respective expression vectors pETnpcB, pETnpcA, and pETnpcC.

Arthrobacter globiformis T6 is unique in that it produces an enzyme yielding only isomaltose from dextran. In the present study, the organism was re-identified and its classification as a new species of the genus Arthrobacter, A. dextranlyticum, was proposed. The high G+C gene (66.8 mol%) for the isomalto-dextranase was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence, with a calculated molecular mass of 65,993 Da (603 amino acids), was confirmed by nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, which covered 71.1% of the amino acid residues of the entire sequence. The enzyme was grouped into glycoside hydrolase family 27, and the C-terminal domain has homology to carbohydrate-binding module family 6. Hyper-exoproduction of the recombinant enzyme was achieved at a level corresponding to approximately 4.6 g l(-1) of culture broth when proteases-deficient Bacillus subtilis cells were used as the host.

NADP phosphatase (NADPase) is an enzyme that converts NADP+ into NAD+ through dephosphorylation of NADP+, and is considered to be one of the possible candidates for regulation of the NAD+/NADP+ balance in vivo. In order to obtain an intrinsic NADPase, the NADP+-degrading activity in a membrane-free cell extract of a Gram-positive bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. strain KM, was first assessed and demonstrated to be mainly achieved through the NADPase reaction, indicating NADPase is essential for degradation of NADP+ and therefore for regulation of the NAD+/NADP+ balance in cytosol. Then, the isolation of cytosolic NADPase was attempted using NADP+ as a substrate. Two NADPase isozymes, designated as NADPases I and II, were purified from the cell extract of the bacterium, and were indicated to be the sole cytosolic NADPases regulating the balance of NAD+/NADP+. NADPases I and II are homodimers of 32 and 30 kDa subunits, respectively, and most active at pH 7-8.

Four Gram-positive bacteria, strains A1-17B(T), A1-22(T), A1-3(T) and A1-8, isolated from the air in the Russian space laboratory Mir, were subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. Phylogenetic analysis of the bacteria based on their 16S rDNA sequence showed that they belong to the genera Rothia (A1-17B(T)), Rhodococcus (A1-22(T)) and Arthrobacter (A1-3(T) and A1-8). Morphological, physiological, chemotaxonomic and genomic characteristics supported the assignments of these strains to these genera, but they could not be classified as any existing species within each respective genus. 16S rDNA similarity values between strain A1-17B(T) and its neighbours, Rothia dentocariosa genomovar II, Rothia dentocariosa, Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia nasimurium, were respectively 99.8, 98.0, 96.4 and 95.4 %.

In laboratory experiments, the rhizobacteria Azospirillum lipoferum 137, Arthrobacter mysorens 7, Agrobacterium radiobacter 10, and Flavobacterium sp. L30 were found to have a relatively high resistance to the toxic heavy metals lead and cadmium (except that strain L30 was found to be sensitive to Cd). When introduced by means of seed bacterization, the heavy metal-resistant strains actively colonized the rhizosphere of barley plants cultivated in uncontaminated and contaminated soils. In both pot and field experiments, seed bacterization improved the growth of barley plants and the uptake of nutrient elements from soil contaminated with Pb and Cd. The bacterization also prevented the accumulation of Pb and Cd in barley plants, thereby mitigating the toxic effect of these heavy metals on the plants.	2004	7	1	Mikrobiologiia	Mikrobiologiia	Agriculture; Arthrobacter; Azospirillum; Cadmium; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Flavobacterium; Hordeum; Lead; Rhizobium; Rhizome; Seeds; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Belimov	A A

Phenol degradation efficiency of cold-tolerant Arthrobacter sp. AG31 and mesophilic Pseudomonas putida DSM6414 was compared. The cold-tolerant strain was cultivated at 10 degrees C, while the mesophile was grown at 25 degrees C. Both strains degraded 200 mg and 400 mg phenol/l within 48-72 h of cultivation, but the cold-tolerant strain produced more biomass than the mesophile. Both strains oxidized catechol by the ortho type of ring fission. Catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (C1,2D) activity was found intra- and extracellularly in the absence and in the presence of phenol. In the presence of 200 mg phenol/l, C1,2D activity of the mesophile was about 1.5- to 2-fold higher than that of the cold-tolerant strain. However, an initial phenol concentration of 400 mg/l resulted in a comparable enzyme activity of the cold-tolerant and the mesophilic strain.

14740724	10.1021/es034455a	Bacterial populations associated with the oxidation and reduction of arsenic in an unsaturated soil.	Microbial populations responsible for the oxidation and reduction of As were examined in unsaturated (aerobic) soil columns treated with 75 microM arsenite [As(III)] or 250 microM arsenate [As(V)]. Arsenite [As(III)] was rapidly oxidized to As(V) via microbial activity, whereas no apparent reduction of As(V) was observed in the column experiments. Eight aerobic heterotrophic bacteria with varying As redox phenotypes were isolated from the same columns. Three isolates, identified as Agrobacterium tumefaciens-, Pseudomonas fluorescens-, and Variovorax paradoxus-like organisms (based on 16S sequence), were As(III) oxidizers, and all were detected in community DNA fingerprints generated by PCR coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. The five other isolates were identified (16S gene sequence) as A. tumefaciens, Flavobacterium sp., Microbacterium sp., and two Arthrobacter sp. -like organisms and were shown to rapidly reduce As(V) under aerobic conditions.

Bacteria and fungi, isolated from United States Air Force (USAF) aviation fuel samples, were identified by gas chromatograph fatty acid methyl ester (GC-FAME) profiling and 16S or 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Thirty-six samples from 11 geographically separated USAF bases were collected. At each base, an above-ground storage tank, a refueling truck, and an aircraft wing tank were sampled at the lowest sample point, or sump, to investigate microbial diversity and dispersion within the fuel distribution chain. Twelve genera, including four Bacillus species and two Staphylococcus species, were isolated and identified. Bacillus licheniformis, the most prevalent organism isolated, was found at seven of the 11 bases. Of the organisms identified, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus luteus, Sphinogmonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., and the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans have previously been isolated from aviation fuel samples.

A comparative investigation of the heterotrophic microflora of 11 species of healthy corals and of white-band-diseased and yellow-band-diseased corals inhabiting the reefs of Nha Trang Bay (Vietnam), which has been exposed to anthropogenic impact, was performed. Fifty-nine strains of heterotrophic bacteria isolated on Y/K and Endo media were investigated and characterized. All the isolates were identified at the genus level by consideration of the results of analysis of their phenotypic properties, determination of the molar percent of G+C bases in their DNA, and the composition of fatty acids of their lipids. In the composition of the microflora of tissues of healthy corals, gamma-proteobacteria prevailed, with halomonads being dominant among them. In addition, the gram-negative bacteria included Pseudomonas and Vibrio spp., members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides (CFB) phylogenetic cluster, and Moraxella sp.

16233797	10.1263/jbb.99.320	Hypothesis: structures, evolution, and ancestor of glucose kinases in the hexokinase family.	Glucose kinase, which we tentatively use in this review, represents the enzymes catalyzing the phosphorylation of glucose and other hexoses by means of phosphoryl donors (ATP, ADP, and inorganic polyphosphate [poly(P)]). Except for glucose kinases utilizing ADP, all other glucose kinases belong to the hexokinase (HK) family and are classified into three groups based on primary structural information, i.e., groups HK, A, and B. The structural and evolutionary relationships of glucose kinases belonging to the above three groups have been controversial due to the lack of tertiary structural information on those in groups A and B. However, recent studies on the tertiary structures of poly(P)/ATP-glucomannokinase (GMK: a glucose kinase in group B) from Arthrobacter sp. strain KM and glucokinase (GK) (ecoGK: a glucose kinase in group A) from Escherichia coli have shed light on this problem.

The X-ray structure of cold-active beta-galactosidase (isoenzyme C-2-2-1) from an Antarctic bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2-2 was solved at 1.9A resolution. The enzyme forms 660 kDa hexamers with active sites opened to the central cavity of the hexamer and connected by eight channels with exterior solvent. To our best knowledge, this is the first cold-active beta-galactosidase with known structure and also the first known beta-galactosidase structure in the form of compact hexamers. The hexamer organization regulates access of substrates and ligands to six active sites and this unique packing, present also in solution, raises questions about its purpose and function. This enzyme belongs to glycosyl hydrolase family 2, similarly to Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, forming tetramers necessary for its enzymatic function. However, we discovered significant differences between these two enzymes affecting the ability of tetramer/hexamer formation and complementation of the active site.

16119849		[The microbial transformation of phenanthrene and anthracene].	The transformation of phenanthrene and anthracene by Rhodococcus rhodnii 135, Pseudomonas fluorescens 26K, and Arthrobacter sp. K3 is studied. Twenty-one intermediates of phenanthrene and anthracene transformation are identified by HPLC, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. P. fluorescens 26K and Arthrobacter sp. K3 are found to produce a wide range of intermediates, whereas R. rhodnii 135 oxidizes phenanthrene, resulting in the formation of a sole product, 3-hydroxyphenanthrene. Putative transformation pathways of phenanthrene and anthracene are proposed for the three bacterial strains studied. These strains can be used to obtain valuable compounds (such as hydroxylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that are difficult to produce by chemical synthesis.	2005	10	11	Mikrobiologiia	Mikrobiologiia	Anthracenes; Arthrobacter; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Mass Spectrometry; Phenanthrenes; Pseudomonas fluorescens; Rhodococcus	Baboshin	M A
16046445	10.1093/jb/mvi093	Role of the N-terminal domain of endoinulinase from Arthrobacter sp. S37 in regulation of enzyme catalysis.	Endoinulinase from Arthrobacter sp. S37 (EnIA), a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 32, is unique in that, unlike other members of the family, it contains a 250-residue N-terminal domain including a "laminin-G like jelly-roll" fold. This unique N-terminal domain is here suggested to be involved in dimerization and catalysis. The essentially inactive nature of enzymes produced by N-terminal truncation (Delta15, Delta45, Delta70, and Delta250) supported the pivotal role of this unique domain in catalysis and the need for its structural integrity. Significant reductions in the enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) were observed when mutations were introduced at highly conserved tryptophan residues (Trp75 and Trp141) in the laminin-G like jelly-roll fold, implying their involvement in catalysis. Results from size-exclusion chromatography of the native and chimeric enzymes in the presence and absence of the domain suggested that the N-terminal domain could mediate dimerization.	2005	9	27	J Biochem	Journal of biochemistry	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Catalysis; Catalytic Domain; Chromatography, Gel; Conserved Sequence; Dimerization; Gene Expression Regulation; Glycoside Hydrolases; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Structure-Activity Relationship	Kim	Kyoung-Yun

The cultural conditions and reaction conditions for asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines with this microorganism were examined. The transaminase was inducible, and its production was enhanced by the addition of sec-butylamine and 3-amino-2,2-dimethylbutane to the culture medium.

15929984	10.1074/jbc.M504215200	The crystal structure of Mlc, a global regulator of sugar metabolism in Escherichia coli.	Mlc from Escherichia coli is a transcriptional repressor controlling the expression of a number of genes encoding enzymes of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), including ptsG and manXYZ, the specific enzyme II for glucose and mannose PTS transporters. In addition, Mlc controls the transcription of malT, the gene of the global activator of the mal regulon. The inactivation of Mlc as a repressor is mediated by binding to an actively transporting PtsG (EIICB(Glc)). Here we report the crystal structure of Mlc at 2.7 A resolution representing the first described structure of an ROK (repressors, open reading frames, and kinases) family protein. Mlc forms stable dimers thus explaining its binding affinity to palindromic operator sites. The N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain of Mlc is stabilized by the amphipathic C-terminal helix implicated earlier in EIICB(Glc) binding.

Degradation of a synthetic tanning agent CNSF (a condensation product of 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid (2-NSA) and formaldehyde) by four activated sludges, two previously characterised bacterial strains, Arthrobacter sp. 2AC and Comamonas sp. 4BC, and the fungus Cunninghamella polymorpha, was studied in batch culture at 25 degrees C by determining the changes in the concentrations of CNSF and its component monomers and oligomers (n2-n11). The loss of individual oligomers was correlated with the length of the NSA-CH2 chain. Approximately 25% of the total CNSF was degraded (i.e. mineralised) by the microbes contained in the four activated sludges and by the two bacterial isolates but with different lag phases and at different overall rates. The decline in CNSF concentration was due almost entirely to the biodegradation of the monomers (34.3% of CNSF) and, in particular, 2-NSA (27% of CNSF). There was no change in the n2-n11 components.

Two bacterial strains, 2AC and 4BC, both capable of utilizing naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid (2-NSA) as a sole source of carbon, were isolated from activated sludges previously exposed to tannery wastewater. Enrichments were carried out in mineral salt medium (MSM) with 2-NSA as the sole carbon source. 16S rDNA sequencing analysis indicated that 2AC is an Arthrobacter sp. and 4BC is a Comamonas sp. Within 33 h, both isolates degraded 100% of 2-NSA in MSM and also 2-NSA in non-sterile tannery wastewater. The yield coefficient was 0.33 g biomass dry weight per gram of 2-NSA. A conceptual model, which describes the aerobic transformation of organic matter, was used for interpreting the biodegradation kinetics of 2-NSA. The half-lives for 2-NSA, at initial concentrations of 100 and 500 mg/l in MSM, ranged from 20 h (2AC) to 26 h (4BC) with lag-phases of 8 h (2AC) and 12 h (4BC).

15727150	10.1007/s10531-004-0473-x	Microbiological degradation of pentane by immobilized cells of Arthrobacter sp.	The increasing production of several plastics such as expanded polystyrene, widely used as packaging and building materials, has caused the release of considerable amounts of pentane employed as an expanding agent. Today many microorganisms are used to degrade hydrocarbons in order to minimize contamination caused by several industrial activities. The aim of our work was to identify a suitable microorganism to degrade pentane. We focused our attention on a strain of Arthrobacter sp. which in a shake-flask culture produced 95% degradation of a 10% mixture of pentane in a minimal medium after 42 days of incubation at 20 degrees C.

To study the desulphurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a recalcitrant thiophenic component of fossil fuels, by two bacteria namely Rhodococcus sp. and Arthrobacter sulfureus isolated from oil-contaminated soil/sludge in order to use them for reducing the sulphur content of diesel oil in compliance with environmental regulations. The desulphurization pathway of DBT by the two bacteria was determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry. Both organisms were found to produce 2-hydroxy biphenyl (2-HBP), the desulphurized product of DBT. Sulphur contents of culture supernatants of Rhodococcus sp. and A. sulfureus grown with DBT as sole sulphur source were analysed by X-ray fluorescence indicating sulphur levels of 8 and 10 ppm, respectively, as compared with 27 ppm in control. In order to study desulphurization of diesel oils obtained from an oil refinery, resting cell studies were carried out which showed a decrease of about 50% in sulphur content of the oil obtained from 	2005	5	24	Lett Appl Microbiol	Letters in applied microbiology	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biphenyl Compounds; Fuel Oils; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gasoline; Rhodococcus; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfur; Thiophenes	Labana	S

An esterase that specifically hydrolyzes medium-chain (C(3)-C(5)) monoalkyl phthalates was purified from phthalate-grown Micrococcus sp. YGJ1. The enzyme activity was split into two fractions by hydrophobic chromatography on Phenyl Sepharose, and the enzymes were purified to homogeneity from each fraction. The purified enzymes showed similar properties with respect to molecular mass (60 kDa), subunit molecular mass (27 kDa), N-terminal amino acid sequence, optimal pH (about 7.5), temperature-dependence, substrate specificity, and inhibitor susceptibility. The enzymes showed no activity toward various dialkyl phthalates or aliphatic carboxyl esters. 2-Mercaptoethanol effectively protected the enzymes from spontaneous inactivation. Diethylpyrocarbonate, p-chloromercuribenzoate, Hg(2+), and Cu(2+) strongly inhibited the enzymes, while phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride produced weak inhibition, and various metal chelating reagents were ineffective.

Arthrobacter sp. strains are among the most frequently isolated, indigenous, aerobic bacterial genera found in soils. Member of the genus are metabolically and ecologically diverse and have the ability to survive in environmentally harsh conditions for extended periods of time. The genome of Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1, which was originally isolated from soil at an atrazine spill site, is composed of a single 4,597,686 basepair (bp) circular chromosome and two circular plasmids, pTC1 and pTC2, which are 408,237 bp and 300,725 bp, respectively. Over 66% of the 4,702 open reading frames (ORFs) present in the TC1 genome could be assigned a putative function, and 13.2% (623 genes) appear to be unique to this bacterium, suggesting niche specialization. The genome of TC1 is most similar to that of Tropheryma, Leifsonia, Streptomyces, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, and analyses suggest that A. aurescens TC1 has expanded its metabolic abilities by relying on the duplication of catabolic	2007	9	27	PLoS Genet	PLoS genetics	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chromosomes, Bacterial; DNA Transposable Elements; DNA, Circular; Energy Metabolism; Genome, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plasmids; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology	Mongodin	Emmanuel F

17064268	10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00168.x	Contribution of ethylamine degrading bacteria to atrazine degradation in soils.	Bacterial communities that cooperatively degrade atrazine commonly consist of diverse species in which the genes for atrazine dechlorination and dealkylation are variously distributed among different species. Normally, the first step in degradation of atrazine involves dechlorination mediated by atzA, followed by stepwise dealkylation to yield either N-ethylammelide or N-isopropylammelide. As the liberated alkylamine moieties are constituents of many organic molecules other than atrazine, it is possible that a large number of alkylamine-degrading bacteria other than those previously described might contribute to this key step in atrazine degradation. To examine this hypothesis, we isolated 82 bacterial strains from soil by plating soil water extracts on agar media with ethylamine as a sole carbon source. Among the relatively large number of isolates, only 3 were able to degrade N-ethylammelide, and in each case were shown to carry the atzB gene and atzC genes.

The host range and transfer frequency of an IncP-1 plasmid (pKJK10) among indigenous bacteria in the barley rhizosphere was investigated. A new flow cytometry-based cultivation-independent method for enumeration and sorting of transconjugants for subsequent 16S rRNA gene classification was used. Indigenous transconjugant rhizosphere bacteria were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and identified by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from the sorted cells. The host range of the pKJK10 plasmid was exceptionally broad, as it included not only bacteria belonging to the alpha, beta, and gamma subclasses of the Proteobacteria, but also Arthrobacter sp., a gram-positive member of the Actinobacteria. The transfer frequency (transconjugants per donor) from the Pseudomonas putida donor to the indigenous bacteria was 7.03 x 10(-2) +/- 3.84 x 10(-2).

16962302	10.1016/j.micres.2006.07.015	Characterization of bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater according to probable modes of hexadecane uptake.	Bacterial isolates from industrial wastewater were characterized according to probable modes of hexadecane uptake based on data for cell surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying activity, glycoside content and surface tension of cell-free culture medium. The results obtained suggested that both modes of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake by bacterial strains take place, direct uptake and alkane transfer. The increase in cell surface hydrophobicity and glycoside production by the strains suggested the existence of biosurfactant-enhanced interfacial uptake of the alkane. Such mechanism is probably predominant for three isolates, Staphylococcus sp. HW-2, Streptococcus sp. HW-9 and Bacillus sp. HW-4. Secreted biosurfactants enhanced mainly alkane emulsification for most hydrophobic isolate Arthrobacter sp. HW-8, and micellar transfer for most hydrophilic isolate Streptococcus sp. HW-5. For other strains (67%) both mechanisms of biosurfactant-enhanced hexadecane uptake probably take place 	2008	9	25	Microbiol Res	Microbiological research	Alkanes; Bacteria; Emulsifying Agents; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Industrial Waste; Surface-Active Agents; Water Microbiology	Vasileva-Tonkova	Evgenia
16949580	10.1016/j.febslet.2006.08.031	Mutational analysis of 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase: relationship between nylon oligomer hydrolytic and esterolytic activities.	Carboxylesterase (EII') from Arthrobacter sp. KI72 has 88% homology to 6-aminohexanoate-dimer hydrolase (EII) and possesses ca. 0.5% of the level of 6-aminohexanoate-linear dimer (Ald)-hydrolytic activity of EII. To study relationship between Ald-hydrolytic and esterolytic activities, random mutations were introduced into the gene for Hyb-24 (an EII/EII' hybrid with the majority of the sequence deriving for EII' and possessing an EII'-like level of Ald-hydrolytic activity). Either a G181D or a D370Y substitution in Hyb-24 increased the Ald-hydrolytic activity ca. 10-fold, and a G181D/D370Y double substitution increased activity ca. 100-fold. On the basis of kinetic studies and the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme, we suggest that binding of Ald is improved by these mutations. D370Y increased esterolytic activity for glycerylbutyrate ca. 30-50-fold, whereas G181D decreased the activity to 30% of the parental enzyme.	2006	10	27	FEBS Lett	FEBS letters	Amidohydrolases; Arthrobacter; Catalysis; DNA Mutational Analysis; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Lipase; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Nylons; Protein Structure, Secondary; Recombinant Proteins; Structure-Activity Relationship; Substrate Specificity	Ohki	Taku

Arthrobacter sp. P1-1, isolated from a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated site in Hilo, HI, USA, can decompose phenanthrene (40 mg l(-1)) completely within 7 days. A detailed phenanthrene metabolism map was constructed based on metabolite analysis and replacement cultures. Initial dioxygenation occurs on 1,2-, 3,4-, and 9,10-C of phenanthrene, dominantly on 3,4-C positions. Rapid accumulation of 5,6- and 7,8-benzocoumarin suggests that phenanthrene-1,2- and -3,4-diols mainly undergo meta-cleavage. However, a trace amount of o-carboxyvinylnaphthoates and diphenic acid indicates a limited extent of ortho-cleavage of the diols. Naphthalene-1,2-diol, as a common and converged metabolite, was formed from 1-[(E)-2-carboxyvinyl]-2-naphthoic acid, naphthalene-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid in separate culture tests.

SB to increase lactose hydrolysis reveals new sites affecting low temperature activity.	We examined variants of an especially cold-active beta-galactosidase (BgaS) to better understand features affecting enzyme activity at temperature extremes. We targeted locations corresponding to a region in the LacZ enzyme previously shown to increase activity and decrease thermostability. Changes in this region of BgaS consistently caused the elimination or reduction of activity. A gene (bgaS3) encoding a loss of function variant was subjected to random mutagenesis to restore activity and discover potential interactions important in cold activity. Gene sequences from the resulting library indicated that only two amino acid alterations, E229D and V405A, were required to restore activity. Genes with combinations of these mutations were constructed and their enzymes purified. Enzymes with the E229D/V405A/G803D alterations (BgaS6), or E229D/V405A (BgaS7) had similar thermal optima and thermostabilities as BgaS.

16707696	10.1128/JB.01866-05	The X-ray structure of the haloalcohol dehalogenase HheA from Arthrobacter sp. strain AD2: insight into enantioselectivity and halide binding in the haloalcohol dehalogenase family.	Haloalcohol dehalogenases are bacterial enzymes that cleave the carbon-halogen bond in short aliphatic vicinal haloalcohols, like 1-chloro-2,3-propanediol, some of which are recalcitrant environmental pollutants. They use a conserved Ser-Tyr-Arg catalytic triad to deprotonate the haloalcohol oxygen, which attacks the halogen-bearing carbon atom, producing an epoxide and a halide ion. Here, we present the X-ray structure of the haloalcohol dehalogenase HheA(AD2) from Arthrobacter sp. strain AD2 at 2.0-A resolution. Comparison with the previously reported structure of the 34% identical enantioselective haloalcohol dehalogenase HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 shows that HheA(AD2) has a similar quaternary and tertiary structure but a much more open substrate-binding pocket. Docking experiments reveal that HheA(AD2) can bind both enantiomers of the haloalcohol substrate 1-p-nitrophenyl-2-chloroethanol in a productive way, which explains the low enantiopreference of HheA(AD2).

16676189	10.1007/s00360-006-0086-7	Xylose utilization and short-chain fatty acid production by selected components of the intestinal microflora of a rodent pollinator (Aethomys namaquensis).	Namaqua rock mice (Aethomys namaquensis) consume nectar xylose when visiting Protea flowers. Whole-animal metabolism studies suggest that the gastrointestinal microflora plays an important role in xylose metabolism in A. namaquensis. We collected caecal contents under anaerobic conditions, cultured caecal microflora both aerobically and anaerobically, and assessed caecal microbial xylose utilization using a (14)C-xylose incubation assay. All four mice sampled hosted culturable caecal micro-organisms that tested positive for xylose utilization. These were classified by 16S rRNA based taxonomy as: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis, Shigella boydii, Arthrobacter sp. and members of the fungal genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Cultures of these isolates were then analyzed by gas chromatography to determine the types and quantities of short-chain fatty acids produced by xylose fermentation. These results are discussed in the context of other studies of gut microfl	2006	11	2	J Comp Physiol B	Journal of comparative physiology.

16672499	10.1128/AEM.72.5.3524-3530.2006	A single monooxygenase, ese, is involved in the metabolism of the organochlorides endosulfan and endosulfate in an Arthrobacter sp.	In this paper we describe isolation of a bacterium capable of degrading both isomers of the organochloride insecticide endosulfan and its toxic metabolite, endosulfate. The bacterium was isolated from a soil microbial population that was enriched with continuous pressure to use endosulfate as the sole source of sulfur. Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence of the bacterium indicated that it was an Arthrobacter species. The organochloride-degrading activity was not observed in the presence of sodium sulfite as an alternative sulfur source, suggesting that the activity was part of the sulfur starvation response of the strain. A gene, ese, encoding an enzyme capable of degrading both isomers of endosulfan and endosulfate was isolated from this bacterium. The enzyme belongs to the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase family whose members require reduced flavin for activity.

The bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) were analysed using molecular fingerprints. We aimed to determine to what extent the structure of different microbial groups in the rhizosphere is influenced by plant species and sampling site. Total community DNA was extracted from bulk and rhizosphere soil taken from three sites in Germany in two consecutive years. Bacterial, fungal and group-specific (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria) primers were used to PCR-amplify 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene fragments from community DNA prior to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Bacterial fingerprints of soil DNA revealed a high number of equally abundant faint bands, while rhizosphere fingerprints displayed a higher proportion of dominant bands and reduced richness, suggesting selection of bacterial populations in this environment.

A thermoalkalophilic and cellulase-free xylanase produced from Arthrobacter sp. MTCC 5214 by solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as a carbon source was evaluated for prebleaching of kraft pulp. The UV absorption spectrum of the compounds released by enzyme treatment showed a characteristic peak at 280 nm, indicating the presence of lignin in the released colouring matter. Enzymatic prebleaching of kraft pulp showed 20% reduction in kappa number of the pulp without much change in viscosity.

Attachment of certain bacteria to living arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal extraradical hyphae may be an important prerequisite for interactions between these microorganisms, with implications for nutrient supply and plant health. The attachment of five different strains of gfp-tagged soil bacteria (Paenibacillus brasilensis PB177 (pnf8), Bacillus cereus VA1 (pnf8), Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 :: gfp/lux, Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6G, and Paenibacillus peoriae BD62 (pnf8)) to vital and nonvital extraradical hyphae of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus sp. MUCL 43205 and Glomus intraradices MUCL 43194 was examined. Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus did not attach to hyphae, whereas the other bacterial strains did to a varying degree.

A Gram-positive, rod-shaped, non-spore-forming bacterium, strain CSCT, was isolated from diseased, surface-sterilized specimens of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and subjected to polyphasic taxonomic analysis. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that the strain was a new member of the family Micrococcaceae. Nearest phylogenetic neighbours were determined as Renibacterium salmoninarum (94.0%), Arthrobacter globiformis (94.8%) and Arthrobacter russicus (94.6%). Although the predominant fatty acids (anteiso C15:0), cell-wall sugars (galactose, glucose) and polar lipids (diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol) are in accordance with those of members of the genus Arthrobacter, strain CSCT can be distinguished from members of the genus Arthrobacter by biochemical tests, the absence of a rod-coccus life cycle and the occurrence of the partially saturated menaquinone MK-10(H2) as the predominant menaquinone.

Wohlfahrtia magnifica (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) is the major myiasis-causing fly species in the whole of Eurasia for most important domestic animals. The aim of the present work was to obtain data on the culturable bacteria isolated under aerobic conditions from this fly: bacteria were isolated from all developmental stages (larvae, pupa, and imago) of Wohlfahrtia magnifica, and the third-stage larval organs were also sampled. To determine the possible antagonistic effects between the dominant bacterial groups, an antibiosis assay was carried out. Plating and isolation of bacteria was performed by classical microbiological methods. Characterization of the isolated strains was carried out via a polyphasic approach; classical phenotypic tests, chemotaxonomical examinations, and 16S rDNA sequence analyses were also applied.

A strain of bacterium XZ-3 capable of highly degrading chlorpyrifos was screened from the soil sample collected from a pesticide plant after taming and enrichment. Based on analysis of phenotype, physiological and biochemical characters and 16S rDNA, XZ-3 was identified as Arthrobacter sp.. The effects of carbon source, pH, temperature and chlorpyrifos concentration on degradation were determined. The growth of bacteria in culture media were measured by visible absorption spectrophotometry under 400 nm. The residual chlorpyrifos in culture media was extracted with an equal volume of petroleum ether, and then determined by ultra-violet spectrophotometry. The results showed that the degradation rate of chlorpyrifos by XZ-3 was 86.8% in 24 h. The biodegradation rates were the highest when the additional carbon source was 0.3%, pH value was 9, chlorpyrifos concentration was 100 mg x L(-1), and cultivated temperature was 30 degrees C.

18092474		Arthrobacter subterraneus sp. nov., isolated from deep subsurface water of the South Coast of Korea.	Strain CH7T, a pale yellow-pigmented bacterium and new isolate from deep subsurface water of the South Coast of Korea, was subjected to a polyphasic taxonomic study. CH7T grew between 5 and 37 degrees C, pH 5.3-10.5, and tolerated up to 13% NaCl. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CH7T was associated with the genus Arthrobacter and phylogenetically closely related to the type strains Arthrobacter tumbae (99.4%) and Arthrobacter parietis (99.1%). However, DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed 2.1% and 12% between strain CH7T and Arthrobacter tumbae and Arthrobacter parietis, respectively. Thus, the phenotypic and phylogenetic differences suggested that CH7T should be placed in the genus Arthrobacter as a novel species, for which the name Arthrobacter subterraneus sp. nov. is proposed. In addition, the type strain for the new species is CH7T (=KCTC 9997T=DSM 17585T).	2008	1	18	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Korea; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater	Chang	Ho-Won

Spacecraft-associated spores and four non-spore-forming bacterial isolates were prepared in Atacama Desert soil suspensions and tested both in solution and in a desiccated state to elucidate the shadowing effect of soil particulates on bacterial survival under simulated Martian atmospheric and UV irradiation conditions. All non-spore-forming cells that were prepared in nutrient-depleted, 0.2-microm-filtered desert soil (DSE) microcosms and desiccated for 75 days on aluminum died, whereas cells prepared similarly in 60-microm-filtered desert soil (DS) microcosms survived such conditions. Among the bacterial cells tested, Microbacterium schleiferi and Arthrobacter sp. exhibited elevated resistance to 254-nm UV irradiation (low-pressure Hg lamp), and their survival indices were comparable to those of DS- and DSE-associated Bacillus pumilus spores.

Micrococcu luteus CN1 was found to be able to utilize cyclohexanone well from the strains originally isolated from Pacific Ocean sediment. The optimum conditions for its growth were determined as 25 degrees C -37 degrees C, pH 8, salinity 6%. It could survive in the medium with high concentration of cyclohexanone ( &gt; 44% V/V), and grew most vigorously in medium with 16.7% (V/V) cyclohexanone. CN1 could transform cyclohexanol to cyclohexanone which could be further degraded and mineralized quickly. This indicated the presence of cyclohexanol dehydrogenase and probable presence of cyclohexanone monooxygenase. With degenerate PCR for cloning part of cyclohexanone monooxygenase gene, the DNA fragment of 450bp was gotten. Amino acid sequence analysis showed that it owned the conserved sequence of the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase family and had the highest homology of 80% with cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Arthrobacter sp.

Atrazine could be used as the sole carbon, nitrogen and energy sources for growth by strain Arthrobacter sp. AG1, and the atrazine-degrading genes of AG1 were found to be the combination of trzN, atzB and atzC. The atrazine chloride hydrolysase gene trzN was cloned by PCR amplification,whose sequence shared 99% identity with that of Norcardioides sp. C190. Two large plasmids were found in AG1,and trzN and atzB were confirmed to be localized on the larger plasmid pAG1 by the method of southern hybridization. Subculture of AG1 in liquid LB for three generations, 34% of the subsequent cells were found to lose degrading activity, however, neither plasmid was lost. PCR amplification results showed that the mutants had only lost the trzN gene instead of atzB and atzC. It was deduced that mutation might be due to the trzN gene deletion from the plasmid.

A gene encoding inulin fructotransferase (di-D-fructofuranose 1,2': 2,3' dianhydride [DFA III]-producing IFTase, EC 4.2.2.18) from Bacillus sp. snu-7 was cloned. This gene was composed of a single, 1,353-bp open reading frame encoding a protein composed of a 40-amino acid signal peptide and a 410-amino acid mature protein. The deduced amino acid sequence was 98% identical to Arthrobacter globiformis C11-1 IFTase (DFA III-producing). The enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli as a functionally active, His-tagged protein, and it was purified in a single step using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme showed much higher specific activity (1,276units/mg protein) than other DFA III-producing IFTases. The recombinant and native enzymes were optimally active in very similar pH and temperature conditions.

In the aim at optimizing glyphosate and diuron mineralization, all the combinations, i.e., free and/or immobilized cells in Ca-alginate beads were tested. With the synthetic medium, the simultaneous mineralization of glyphosate and diuron required at least the immobilization of Pseudomonas 4ASW. Conversely, with the sediment extract medium, only the mineralization of diuron was observed, most probably, because of both nutrient deficiency and phosphate in the sediment extract medium.	2008	5	22	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Aniline Compounds; Arthrobacter; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Cells, Immobilized; Culture Media; Delftia acidovorans; Diuron; Geologic Sediments; Glycine; Herbicides; Pseudomonas	Bazot	S

The growth dynamics of this community was precisely described during the ripening of a model cheese, and the Lotka-Volterra model was used to evaluate species interactions. Subsequently, the effects on ecosystem functioning of yeast omissions in the microbial community were evaluated. It was found both in the Lotka-Volterra model and in the omission study that negative interactions occurred between yeasts. Yarrowia lipolytica inhibited mycelial expansion of Geotrichum candidum, whereas Y. lipolytica and G. candidum inhibited Debaryomyces hansenii cell viability during the stationary phase.

D-serine dehydratase (DSD) catalyses the conversion of d-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. d-Serine is a physiological modulator of glutamate neurotransmission in vertebrate brains. In mammals d-serine is degraded by d-amino-acid oxidase, whereas in chicken brain it is degraded by DSD, as we have recently demonstrated [Tanaka et al. (2007) Anal. Biochem. 362, 83-88]. To clarify the roles of DSD in avian species, we purified DSD from chicken kidney. The purified enzyme was a heterodimer consisting of subunits separable by SDS-PAGE but with identical N-terminal amino acid sequences. The prominent absorption at 416 nm and the inhibition of the enzyme both by hydroxylamine and by aminooxyacetate suggested that the enzyme contains pyridoxal 5'-phosphate as a cofactor. The enzyme showed the highest specificity to d-serine: the k(cat)/K(m) values of DSD for d-serine, d-threonine and l-serine were 6.19 x 10(3), 164 and 16 M(-1)s(-1), respectively.

SL3 cells also transformed benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and catechol into cis,cis-muconic acid, suggesting that one benzene ring of trans-stilbene was converted into cis,cis-muconic acid via benzaldehyde formed by its C(alpha)=C(beta) bond cleavage.	2008	8	21	Biodegradation	Biodegradation	Arthrobacter; Molecular Structure; Stilbenes; Time Factors	Yamada	Mamoru

A 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) hydroxylase-encoding gene, on a 2.7-kb genomic DNA fragment, was cloned from the thermophile Geobacillus sp. PA-9. The Geobacillus sp. PA-9 4-HPA hydroxylase gene, designated hpaH, encodes a protein of 494 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 56.269 Da. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the hpaH gene product displayed &lt;30% amino-acid sequence identity with the larger monooxygenase components of the previously characterized two-component 4-HPA 3-hydroxylases from Escherichia coli W and Klebsiella pneumoniae M5a1. A second oxidoreductase component was not present on the 2.7-kb genomic DNA fragment. The deduced amino-acid sequence of a second C-terminal truncated open reading frame, designated hpaI, exhibited homology to extradiol oxygenases and displayed the highest amino-acid sequence identity (43%) with the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase of Arthrobacter globiformis, encoded by mndD.

17720792	10.1128/JB.01849-06	Cloning of a gene cluster involved in the catabolism of p-nitrophenol by Arthrobacter sp. strain JS443 and characterization of the p-nitrophenol monooxygenase.	The npd gene cluster, which encodes the enzymes of a p-nitrophenol catabolic pathway from Arthrobacter sp. strain JS443, was cloned and sequenced. Three genes, npdB, npdA1, and npdA2, were independently expressed in Escherichia coli in order to confirm the identities of their gene products. NpdA2 is a p-nitrophenol monooxygenase belonging to the two-component flavin-diffusible monooxygenase family of reduced flavin-dependent monooxygenases. NpdA1 is an NADH-dependent flavin reductase, and NpdB is a hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase. The npd gene cluster also includes a putative maleylacetate reductase gene, npdC. In an in vitro assay containing NpdA2, an E. coli lysate transforms p-nitrophenol stoichiometrically to hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol. It was concluded that the p-nitrophenol catabolic pathway in JS443 most likely begins with a two-step transformation of p-nitrophenol to hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, catalyzed by NpdA2. Hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone is reduced to hydroxyquinol, which is d	2008	1	8	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Genes, Bacterial; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Nitrophenols; Oxygenases; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Substrate Specificity	Perry	Lynda L

Twelve bacterial strains belonging to eight taxonomic groups: Brevibacterium linens, Microbacterium foliorum, Arthrobacter arilaitensis, Staphylococcus cohnii, Staphylococcus equorum, Brachybacterium sp., Proteus vulgaris and Psychrobacter sp., isolated from different surface-ripened French cheeses, were investigated for their abilities to generate volatile aroma compounds. Out of 104 volatile compounds, 54 volatile compounds (identified using dynamic headspace technique coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry [GC-MS]) appeared to be produced by the different bacteria on a casamino acid medium. Four out of eight species used in this study: B. linens, M. foliorum, P. vulgaris and Psychrobacter sp. showed a high flavouring potential. Among these four bacterial species, P. vulgaris had the greatest capacity to produce not only the widest varieties but also the highest quantities of volatile compounds having low olfactive thresholds such as sulphur compounds.

A biofilter inoculated with Arthrobacter sp. was applied to the simultaneous elimination of trimethylamine (TMA) and ammonia (NH3) from the exhaust air of swine waste storage pits. The results showed that the biofilter achieved average removal efficiencies of 96.8+/-2.5% and 97.2+/-2.3% for TMA and NH3, respectively. A near-neutral pH (7.3-7.4) was maintained due to the accumulation of acid metabolites and the adsorption of alkaline NH3. Low moisture demand, low pressure drop and high biofilm stability in the system were other advantages. After long-term operation, the bacterial community structure showed that at least twenty-five bands were explicitly detected by a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method. However, the inoculated Arthrobacter sp. still maintained a dominant population (&gt;50%).

17669462	10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.06.058	Complete degradation of butyl benzyl phthalate by a defined bacterial consortium: role of individual isolates in the assimilation pathway.	Two bacterial strains, in consortium, were isolated by enrichment techniques from municipal waste-contaminated soil, which utilized butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) as the sole carbon source. One of the isolates was identified as Arthrobacter sp. strain WY and the other one as Acinetobacter sp. strain FW based on the morphological, nutritional and biochemical characteristics and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Various metabolites of BBP engendered by Arthrobacter sp. strain WY were isolated and identified by a combination of chromatographic and spectrophotometric analyses, which revealed a pathway involving monobutylphthalate (MBuP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid. The protocatechuic acid in turn was processed by ortho-cleavage dioxygenase to form beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconate, ultimately leading to the TCA cycle. The Arthrobacter sp. strain WY could not utilize the hydrolyzed alcohols of BBP.

Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is the second highest volume pesticide used in the United States. It is a mutagenic compound whose exposure poses significant health effects, One of the most desirable, environmentally friendly treatment methods is bioremediation. For soil-based contamination, the effectiveness of bioremediation will also be affected by the presence of an active indigenous population, sorption of the contaminant onto the soil, and environmental parameters. Two pure strains and their mixed culture were used to evaluate PCP biodegradation in two different field soils, Columbia (CO) and New Mexico (NM). Biostimulation of the indigenous microbes was evaluated by adding nutrients. The efficiency of adding bacteria strains (bioaugmentation) for degrading PCP was determined with Arthrobacter sp., Flavobacterium sp. and a 50:50 mixture of the two bacteria strains. In CO soil, only 24%, 12% and 25% of the initial PCP concentration were degraded by Flavobacterium sp., Arthrobacter sp. and	2007	8	23	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Environmental science and pollution research international	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Culture Techniques; Flavobacterium; Humans; Pentachlorophenol; Pesticides; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Pu	Xunchi

The microbial communities in milks from one herd were evaluated during 1-year of lactation, using molecular methods to evaluate their stability and the effect of breeding conditions on their composition. The diversity of microbial communities was measured using two approaches: molecular identification by 16S and 18S rDNA sequencing of isolates from counting media (two milks), and direct identification using 16S rDNA from clone libraries (six milks). The stability of these communities was evaluated by counting on selective media and by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of variable region V3 of the 16S rRNA gene and variable region V4 of the 18S rRNA gene. One hundred and eighteen milk samples taken throughout the year were analyzed. Wide diversity among bacteria and yeasts in the milk was revealed.

17587693	10.1271/bbb.70030	Cloning and characterization of the gene encoding endo-beta-1,3-glucanase from Arthrobacter sp. NHB-10.	The gluA gene, encoding an endo-beta-1,3-glucanase from Arthrobacter sp. (strain NHB-10), was cloned and analyzed. The deduced endo-beta-1,3-glucanase amino acid sequence was 750 amino acids long and contained a 42 amino acid signal peptide with a mature protein of 708 amino acids. There was no similarity to known endo-beta-1,3-glucanases, but GluA was partially similar to two fungal exo-beta-1,3-glucanases in glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 55. Of five possible residues for catalysis and two motifs in two beta-helix heads of GH family 55, three residues and one motif were conserved in GluA, suggesting that GluA is the first bacterial endo-beta-1,3-glucanase in GH family 55. Significant similarity was also found to two proteins of unknown function from Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and S. avermitilis.	2007	9	26	Biosci Biotechnol Biochem	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Base Sequence; Catalytic Domain; Cloning, Molecular; Conserved Sequence; Gene Components; Glucan Endo-1,3-beta-D-Glucosidase; Molecular Sequence Data; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid	Okazaki	Katsuichiro

This report describes phenanthrene uptake as well as the effect of phenanthrene on the membrane phospholipid and fatty acid composition in a newly isolated bacterial strain, Sphe3, that we taxonomically identified as Arthrobacter sp. Strain Sphe3 is able to utilize phenanthrene as a carbon source at high rates and appears to internalize phenanthrene with two mechanisms: a passive diffusion when cells are grown on glucose, and an inducible active transport system when cells are grown on phenanthrene as a sole carbon source. Active transport followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and it was amenable to inhibition by 2,4-dinitrophenol and sodium azide. Evidence provided here indicates that apart from inducing an active PAH uptake, the presence of phenanthrene elicits significant changes in membrane fluidity.	2007	12	6	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	2,4-Dinitrophenol; Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Transport, Active; Glucose; Kinetics; Membrane Fluidity; Membrane Lipids; Phenanthrenes; Phylogeny; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Sodium Azide; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Kallimanis	Aristeidis

D-Methionine was converted to L-methionine in a reaction system where four enzymes were used. D-amino acid oxidase (D-AAO) from Arthrobacter protophormiae was used for the complete conversion of D-methionine to 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid. Catalase was added to prevent 2-oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid decarboxylation. In the second reaction step, L-phenylalanine dehydrogenase (L-PheDH) from Rhodococcus sp. was used to convert 2- oxo-4-methylthiobutyric acid to L-methionine, and formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii was added for NADH regeneration. Enzyme kinetics of all enzymes was analyzed in detail. Mathematical models for separate reactions steps, as well as for the complete system were developed and validated in the batch reactor experiments. Complete conversion of D-methionine to L-methionine was achieved.

The secondary structure of the trimeric protein 4-chlorobenzoyl coenzyme A dehalogenase from Arthrobacter sp. strain TM-1, the second of three enzymes involved in the dechlorination of 4-chlorobenzoate to form 4-hydroxybenzoate, has been examined. E(mM) for the enzyme was 12.59. Analysis by circular dichroism spectrometry in the far uv indicated that 4-chlorobenzoyl coenzyme A dehalogenase was composed mostly of alpha-helix (56%) with lesser amounts of random coil (21%), beta-turn (13%) and beta-sheet (9%). These data are in close agreement with a computational prediction of secondary structure from the primary amino acid sequence, which indicated 55.8% alpha-helix, 33.7% random coil and 10.5% beta-sheet; the enzyme is, therefore, similar to the 4-chlorobenzoyl coenzyme A dehalogenase from Pseudomonas sp.

17410875		[Reaction of microorganisms to the digestive fluid of the earthworms].	The reaction of soil bacteria and fungi to the digestive fluid of the earthworm Aporrectodea caliginosa was studied. The fluid was obtained by centrifugation of the native enzymes of the digestive tract. The inhibition of growth of certain bacteria, spores, and fungal hyphae under the effect of extracts from the anterior and middle sections of the digestive tract of A. caliginosa was discovered for the first time. In bacteria, microcolony formation was inhibited as early as 20-30 s after the application of the gut extracts, which may indicate the nonenzymatic nature of the effect. The digestive fluid exhibited the same microbicidal activity whether the earthworms were feeding on soil or sterile sand. This indicates that the microbicidal agents are formed within the earthworm's body, rather than by soil microorganisms. The effect of the digestive fluid from the anterior and middle divisions is selective in relation to different microorganisms.

Soil microorganisms and plants were studied in samples of arsenic-contaminated soil from two cattle dip sites. The aim was to delineate the parameters that will determine the feasibility of future remediation by growing arsenic-accumulating plants, including the identity and characteristics of some rhizosphere soil microbes. The soil samples contained high total, but low soluble arsenic concentrations which, together with other properties, resembled the previously reported characteristics of dip-site soils from this region of rural Australia. A glasshouse trial demonstrated that dip-site rhizosphere microbes promoted arsenic accumulation by the grass Agrostis tenuis on contaminated dip-site soil without inhibition of growth. The arsenic content of the shoots was increased by 45%.

The first step of the catabolic pathway was found to proceed via a hydrolytic dehalogenation that leads to the formation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid. The dehalogenase encoding genes (fcb) were sequenced and found highly homologous to and organized as those of other 4-chlorobenzoic acid degrading Arthrobacter strains. The fcb genes were cloned and successfully expressed in the heterologous host Pseudomonas putida PaW340 and P. putida KT2442 upper TOL, which acquired the ability to grow on 4-chlorobenzoic acid and 4-chlorotoluene, respectively.

The carbon rod electrode surface was coated with sarcosine oxidase (SOX) and creatine amidinohydrolase by cross-linking under glutaraldehyde vapour. The SOX from Arthrobacter sp. 1-1 N was purified and previously used for creation of a creatine biosensor. The natural SOX electron acceptor, oxygen, was replaced by an [Fe(CN)(6)](3-) /[ Fe(CN)(6)](4-) redox mediating system, which allowed amperometric detection of an analytical signal at +400-mV potential. The response time of the biosensor was less than 1 min. The biosensor showed a linear dependence of the signal vs. creatine concentration at physiological creatine concentration levels.

The 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified AD26 as an Arthrobacter sp. PCR assays indicated that AD26 contained atrazine-degrading genes trzN and atzBC. The trzN gene of AD26 only differs from the trzN of Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 by one base (A--&gt;T at 907) and one amino acid (Met--&gt;Leu at 303).

To isolate and identify black pepper (Piper nigrum L) associated endophytic bacteria antagonistic to Phytophthora capsici causing foot rot disease. Endophytic bacteria (74) were isolated, characterized and evaluated against P. capsici. Six genera belong to Pseudomonas spp (20 strains), Serratia (1 strain), Bacillus spp. (22 strains), Arthrobacter spp. (15 strains), Micrococcus spp. (7 strains), Curtobacterium sp. (1 strain) and eight unidentified strains were isolated from internal tissues of root and stem. Three isolates, IISRBP 35, IISRBP 25 and IISRBP 17 were found effective for Phytophthora suppression in multilevel screening assays which recorded over 70% disease suppression in greenhouse trials. A species closest match (99% similarity) of IISRBP 35 was established as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pseudomonas EF568931), IISRBP 25 as P. putida (Pseudomonas EF568932), and IISRBP 17 as Bacillus megaterium (B. megaterium EU071712) based on 16S rDNA sequencing.

Degradation of butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) by a co-culture of Gordonia sp. strain MTCC 4818 and Arthrobacter sp. strain WY was investigated. In the degradation of BBP by the co-culture, the limitations of the individual species in metabolizing BBP were overcome, leading to the development of a consortium capable of complete utilization of this ester. In the degradation of BBP by the co-culture, the presence of multiple esterases was demonstrated in both species by activity staining of non-denaturing gels, indicating their roles in the degradation process. The esterases were found to be inducible, with unique or broad substrate specificities towards BBP and its monoesters. Moreover, a number of catabolic enzymes other than esterases identified in the metabolism of BBP-degraded intermediates facilitated the co-culture-mediated degradation process. The versatility of the co-culture was further established by the rapid and complete degradation of a mixture of phthalate esters of environme	2008	12	22	Microbiology (Reading)	Microbiology (Reading, England)	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Coculture Techniques; Culture Techniques; Environmental Pollutants; Esterases; Gordonia Bacterium; Phthalic Acids; Soil Microbiology; Substrate Specificity	Chatterjee	Subhankar
18944290	10.1094/PHYTO-98-6-0666	Protection against pathogen and salt stress by four plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria isolated from Pinus sp. on Arabidopsis thaliana.	The ability of four plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, isolated in a previous study, to induce systemic resistance on Arabidopsis thaliana Col 0 against biotic and abiotic stress was evaluated. All the bacteria enhanced protection against the foliar pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 and increased plant tolerance to salt stress (NaCl 60 mM). Bacillus sp. strain L81 and Arthrobacter oxidans strain BB1 performed best with a decrease in the disease index of 61.2 and 52.3%, respectively, and a reduction in the mortality due to salt stress of 72.4 and 57.8%, respectively. Additionally, significant differences were found in growth and photosynthesis, again, L81 and BB1 performed best either in normal or under stress conditions. In order to elucidate the pathway elicited by these two strains to induce systemic resistance, experiments with the transgenic line of Arabidopsis thaliana NahG (defective in salicylic acid [SA]) and with the jar1 mutant (defective in jasmonic acid) were carried 	2009	3	23	Phytopathology	Phytopathology	Antibiosis; Arabidopsis; Arthrobacter; Bacillus; Cyclopentanes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Immunity, Innate; Oxylipins; Pinus; Plant Diseases; Plant Proteins; Pseudomonas syringae; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Salicylic Acid; Sodium Chloride	Barriuso	J
18941993	10.1080/03601230802388793	Mineralization of p-nitrophenol by a new isolate Arthrobacter sp. Y1.	Arthrobacter sp. Y1, capable of metabolizing p-nitrophenol (PNP) as the sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source was isolated from activated sludge. The bacterium could tolerate concentrations of PNP up to 600 mg L(- 1), and degradation of PNP was achieved within 120 h of incubation. PNP and its metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The metabolite formed indicated that the organism followed the 4-nitrocathechol (4-NC) pathway for metabolism of this compound. The relevant degrading-enzyme was extracellular. Addition of other carbon source (glucose 0 approximately 30 g L(- 1)) led to accelerated degradation. If the glucose concentration exceeded 30 g L(- 1), however, degradation was repressed. Spectrophotometry assay of the nitrite and genotoxic study showed that strain Y1 could detoxify PNP. Therefore, the present study may provide a basis for the development of the bioremediation strategies to remedy the pollutants in the environment.	2009	2	13	J Environ Sci Health B	Journal of environmental science and health.

The purpose of this research was to pursuit the quantification of microbial degradation capacity for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by detecting and quantifying a prominent 2,4-D degradation encoding plasmid. Batch reactor acclimation, de-acclimation, and re-acclimation tests were conducted during which periods the courses of 2,4-D dissipation and plasmid evolution were quantitatively measured. Pure cultures of bacterial strains were detected to give rise to a plasmid approximately the size of 90 kb after acclimation. The 90 kb plasmid content of Arthrobacter sp. increased when degradation occurred after acclimation, with a rate that corresponded closely to the degradation rate. During de-acclimation, plasmid content declined exponentially at a half-life of approximately 3.5 days. Re-acclimation saw a renewed induction of plasmid, but substrate consumption limited the rise of plasmid to a level much lower than after the first acclimation.

18838796	10.1271/bbb.80365	Enzymatic characterization of an amine oxidase from Arthrobacter sp. used to measure phosphatidylethanolamine.	Ethanolamine oxidase was screened with the aim of using it to establish a novel enzymatic phosphatidylethanolamine assay. Ethanolamine oxidase activity was detected in the crude extract of Arthrobacter sp., and the enzyme was purified more than 15-fold in three steps with a 54% yield. SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of only one band, which migrated, with an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa. Biochemical characterization of the enzyme showed phenylethylamine to be the preferred substrate, with the highest kcat/Km value. The primary structure, determined by sequencing the cloned gene, showed a high degree of identity to Cu-containing phenylethylamine oxidase (64%). When heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli, the enzyme exhibited only a trace of amine oxidase activity, but high levels of activity emerged after exposure to Cu2+, as is typical of recombinant copper amine oxidases.

Culture-based analysis was employed in parallel with PCR amplification of 16S rDNA, coupled with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to profile bacterial species associated with different developmental stages of the pine false webworm (PFW), Acantholyda erythrocephala, a sawfly pest responsible for incidents of severe defoliation in commercially important tree plantations in North America. Culture-based analysis revealed that Pseudomonas spp. along with Bacillus sphaericus and Arthrobacter sp. were the predominant components of the microflora of the internal organs and identified life-stage-specific associations including Photorhabdus temperata with egg and larval samples and a Janthinobacterium sp. with eonymphs. PCR-DGGE confirmed the predominance of Pseudomonas spp. and B. sphaericus in the majority of samples but did not detect Arthrobacter sp., P. temperate, or Janthinobacterium sp.

18723615	10.1128/JB.00721-08	Genome sequence of the fish pathogen Renibacterium salmoninarum suggests reductive evolution away from an environmental Arthrobacter ancestor.	Renibacterium salmoninarum is the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease and a significant threat to healthy and sustainable production of salmonid fish worldwide. This pathogen is difficult to culture in vitro, genetic manipulation is challenging, and current therapies and preventative strategies are only marginally effective in preventing disease. The complete genome of R. salmoninarum ATCC 33209 was sequenced and shown to be a 3,155,250-bp circular chromosome that is predicted to contain 3,507 open-reading frames (ORFs). A total of 80 copies of three different insertion sequence elements are interspersed throughout the genome. Approximately 21% of the predicted ORFs have been inactivated via frameshifts, point mutations, insertion sequences, and putative deletions. The R. salmoninarum genome has extended regions of synteny to the Arthrobacter sp. strain FB24 and Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 genomes, but it is approximately 1.9 Mb smaller than both Arthrobacter genomes and has a l	2009	1	19	J Bacteriol	Journal of bacteriology	Animals; Arthrobacter; Base Composition; Evolution, Molecular; Fish Diseases; Genes, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Micrococcaceae; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Open Reading Frames; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salmon; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Wiens	Gregory D

Several omega-laurolactam degrading microorganisms were isolated from soil samples. These strains were capable of growing in a medium containing omega-laurolactam as sole source of carbon and nitrogen. Among them, five strains (T7, T31, U124, U224, and U238) were identified as Cupriavidus sp. T7, Acidovorax sp. T31, Cupriavidus sp. U124, Rhodococcus sp. U224, and Sphingomonas sp. U238, respectively. The omega-laurolactam hydrolyzing enzyme from Rhodococcus sp. U224 was purified to homogeneity, and its enzymatic properties were characterized. The enzyme acts on omega-octalactam and omega-laurolactam, but other lactam compounds, amides and amino acid amides, cannot be substrates. The enzyme gene was cloned, and the deduced amino acid sequence showed high homology with 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase (EC 3.5.2.12) from Arthrobacter sp. KI72 and Pseudomonas sp. NK87.

Two 4-chlorophenol-degrading bacteria, strains 4C1-aT and 4C1-b, were isolated from sewage flowing into Geumho River near the Daegu industrial complex in Korea. Cells of the strains were Gram-positive and non-motile, displayed a rod-coccus life cycle and formed creamy white colonies on R2A agar or peptone-carbohydrate agar. The strains had chemotaxonomic markers that were consistent with classification in the genus Arthrobacter, i.e. MK-9(H2) as the major menaquinone, iso- and anteiso-branched components as the predominant fatty acids, galactose, glucose and rhamnose as cell-wall sugars, peptidoglycan-type A3alpha, and DNA G+C content of 63.5-64.4 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, showed that the strains were most similar to Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus DSM 12829T, Arthrobacter oxydans DSM 20119T and Arthrobacter scleromae JCM 12642T (with 98.4, 97.8 and 97.8 % similarity, respectively) and formed a separate lineage with A. chlorophenolicus in the genus A	2008	10	7	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Composition; Chlorophenols; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Genes, rRNA; Korea; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Phenotype; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sewage; Species Specificity	Kim	Kwang Kyu
18671800	10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01271.x	Different substrate specificities of two triazine hydrolases (TrzNs) from Nocardioides species.	Nocardioides sp. strain MTD22 degraded atrazine, ametryn and atraton, as did Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1 and Nocardioides sp. strain C190. These strains contain trzN, a gene coding for TrzN, triazine hydrolase showing a broad substrate range. However, Nocardioides sp. strain AN3 degraded only atrazine despite containing trzN. These differences in s-triazine degradation are presumed to be due to differences in the amino acid sequences of TrzNs. Consequently, 1371 nucleotides of the trzN coding sequences of strains AN3 and MTD22 were determined. Comparisons of the amino acid sequences of TrzNs indicated that three residues of strain AN3 (Thr(214), His(215) and Gln(241)) were distinct from those of the other three strains (Pro(214), Tyr(215) and Glu(241)). To confirm the relationships between these amino acid sequences and the substrate specificities of TrzNs, wild and chimera trzN genes were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli cells.

24031246	10.1590/S1517-83822008000300009	Nitrogen starvation affects bacterial adhesion to soil.	One of the main factors limiting the bioremediation of subsoil environments based on bioaugmentation is the transport of selected microorganisms to the contaminated zones. The characterization of the physiological responses of the inoculated microorganisms to starvation, especially the evaluation of characteristics that affect the adhesion of the cells to soil particles, is fundamental to anticipate the success or failure of bioaugmentation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of nitrogen starvation on cell surface hydrophobicity and cell adhesion to soil particles by bacterial strains previously characterized as able to use benzene, toluene or xilenes as carbon and energy sources. The strains LBBMA 18-T (non-identified), Arthrobacter aurescens LBBMA 98, Arthrobacter oxydans LBBMA 201, and Klebsiella sp. LBBMA 204-1 were used in the experiments.

Nine bacterial strains isolated from two hydrocarbon-contaminated soils were selected because of their capacity for growth in culture media amended with 200 mg/L of one of the following gasoline oxygenates: Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl-tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME). These strains were identified by amplification of their 16S rRNA gene, using fDl and rD1 primers, and were tested for their capacity to grow and biotransform these oxygenates in both mineral and cometabolic media. The isolates were classified as Bacillus simplex, Bacillus drentensis, Arthrobacter sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Gordonia amicalis (two strains), Nocardioides sp., and Rhodococcus ruber. Arthrobacter sp. (strain MG) and A. calcoaceticus (strain M10) consumed 100 (cometabolic medium) and 82 mg/L (mineral medium) of oxygenate TAME in 21 d, respectively, under aerobic conditions.

S37 inulinase (EnIA), a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 32, were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and pH-dependence studies of the enzyme efficiency and homology modeling were carried out for EnIA and for D460E mutant. The enzyme efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of the E323A and E519A mutants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type due to a substantial decrease in k(cat), but not due to variations in K(m), consistent with their putative roles as nucleophile and acid/base catalyst, respectively. The D460A mutant was totally inactive, whereas the D460E and D460N mutants were active to some extent, revealing Asp460 as a catalytic residue and demonstrating that the presence of a carboxylate group in this position is a prerequisite for catalysis.

A novel Gram-positive bacterium, designated SYB2T, was isolated from wastewater reservoir sediment, and a polyphasic taxonomic study was conducted based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical features, as well as the analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence. During the phylogenetic analysis of the strain SYB2T, results of a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis placed this bacterium in the genus Arthrobacter within the family Micrococcaceae. SYB2T and Arthrobacter protophormiae ATCC 19271T, the most closely related species, both exhibited a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.99%. The genomic DNA G+C content of the novel strain was found to be 62.0 mol%. The predominant fatty acid composition was anteiso-C15:0, anteiso-C17:0, iso-C16:0, and iso-C15:0.

Further study on TMA removal showed that the optimal pH was near neutral (6.0-8.0). The supply of high glucose (&gt;0.1%) inhibited TMA removal, maybe due to substrate competition. However, complete TMA degradation was achieved under the co-immobilization of Paracoccus sp. CP2 and Arthrobacter sp. CP1 ( approximately 96%).

The phenylurea herbicide diuron [N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethylurea] is widely used in a broad range of herbicide formulations, and consequently, it is frequently detected as a major water contaminant in areas where there is extensive use. We constructed a linuron [N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methoxy-N-methylurea]- and diuron-mineralizing two-member consortium by combining the cooperative degradation capacities of the diuron-degrading organism Arthrobacter globiformis strain D47 and the linuron-mineralizing organism Variovorax sp. strain SRS16. Neither of the strains mineralized diuron alone in a mineral medium, but combined, the two strains mineralized 31 to 62% of the added [ring-U-(14)C]diuron to (14)CO(2), depending on the initial diuron concentration and the cultivation conditions. The constructed consortium was used to initiate the degradation and mineralization of diuron in soil without natural attenuation potential. This approach led to the unexpected finding that Variovorax 	2008	5	13	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Arthrobacter; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Radioisotopes; Comamonadaceae; Culture Media; Diuron; Herbicides; Linuron; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Soil Microbiology	S..rensen	Sebastian R
18272220	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2007.12.017	Novel chromium tolerant microorganisms: isolation, characterization and their biosorption capacity.	Effluent from tannery, electroplating and electronic industries contain chromium which is highly toxic. This paper reports isolation of chromium tolerant microorganisms from solid waste as well as liquid effluent of an electroplating industry. Nine isolates were obtained that can tolerate chromium concentration up to 700 mg/L. They reach their stationary phase within 8-12h and can biosorb 95% of initial 200mg/L concentration of chromium within 4-10h. Fourier Transform Infra Red analysis of the biomass exposed to chromium indicates that amino and carboxylate groups in the biomass are involved in biosorption process. 16S RNA results of two most active organisms indicate that they are Bacillus marisflavi and Arthrobacter sp. and they show 98% and 96% homology similarity in the phylogenetic tree, respectively.	2011	7	14	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	Adaptation, Physiological; Adsorption; Arthrobacter; Bacillus; Bacteria; Bacterial Physiological Phenomena; Biomass; Chromium; Electroplating; Environmental Pollutants; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Industrial Waste	Mishra	Shailendra
18228015	10.1007/s00253-008-1343-3	Degradation of 4-fluorophenol by Arthrobacter sp. strain IF1.	A Gram-positive bacterial strain capable of aerobic biodegradation of 4-fluorophenol (4-FP) as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated by selective enrichment from soil samples collected near an industrial site. The organism, designated strain IF1, was identified as a member of the genus Arthrobacter on the basis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence analysis. Arthrobacter strain IF1 was able to mineralize 4-FP up to concentrations of 5 mM in batch culture. Stoichiometric release of fluoride ions was observed, suggesting that there is no formation of halogenated dead-end products during 4-FP metabolism. The degradative pathway of 4-FP was investigated using enzyme assays and identification of intermediates by gas chromatography (GC), GC-mass spectrometry (MS), high-performance liquid chromatography, and liquid chromatography-MS. Cell-free extracts of 4-FP-grown cells contained no activity for catechol 1,2-dioxygenase or catechol 2,3-dioxygenase, which indicates that the pathway 	2008	6	17	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hydroquinones; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenols; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology	Ferreira	Maria Isabel M

18080911	10.1080/10826060701774361	Effect of immobilization on kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of sulfide oxidase from Arthrobacter species.	In order to determine the impact of immobilization on biocatalytic efficacy of sulfide oxidase, the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of native and DEAE-cellulose immobilized sulfide oxidase from Arthrobacter species FR-3 were evaluated. Immobilization increased the catalytic efficiency of sulfide oxidase by producing a lower Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and a higher rate of catalysis (Vmax) at different temperatures. The first-order kinetic analysis of thermal denaturation demonstrated that the values of enthalpy (delta H*d) and entropy (delta S*d) of immobilized sulfide oxidase were lower than the native enzyme, confirming the thermal stabilization of sulfide oxidase by immobilization. The delta H*d and delta S*d of the immobilized enzyme at 35 degrees C were 138.07 kJ/mol and 122.04 J/K/mol, respectively. These results suggest that immobilization made the sulfide oxidase from Arthrobacter sp. FR-3 thermodynamically more efficient for catalysis of sulfide oxidation.	2008	4	3	Prep Biochem Biotechnol	Preparative biochemistry &amp; biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Catalysis; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Stability; Enzymes, Immobilized; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donors; Thermodynamics	Mohapatra	Bidyut R

Rhizospheric soil samples were taken from Puna native grasses along an altitudinal gradient. Biodiversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and associated bacteria was analyzed considering altitude and grasses photosynthetic pathways (metabolic type C3, C4). Cultivation-dependent approaches were applied to obtain further information about the phylogeny of the dominating cultivable aerobic-heterotrophic bacteria communities present in rhizospheric soil samples. In average, the bacterial count ranged between 1.30 x 10(2) and 8.66 x 10(4) CFU g(-1) of dry weight of soil. Individual bacterial colonies of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria grown on R2A medium were morphologically grouped and identified as typical soil bacteria belonging to the genera Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter.

Present study describes isolation of a multiple metal-resistant Arthrobacter ramosus strain from mercuric salt-contaminated soil. The isolate was found to resist and bioaccumulate several metals, such as cadmium, cobalt, zinc, chromium and mercury. Maximum tolerated concentrations for above metals were found to be 37, 525, 348, 1530 and 369 microM, respectively. The isolate could also reduce and detoxify redox-active metals like chromium and mercury, indicating that it has great potential in bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated sites. Chromate reductase and mercuric reductase (MerA) activities in protein extract of the culture were found to be 2.3 and 0.17 units mg(-1) protein, respectively. MerA enzyme was isolated from the culture by (NH(4))(2)SO(4) precipitation followed by dye affinity chromatography and its identity was confirmed by nano-LC-MS/MS.

19996699		Isolation of an isocarbophos-degrading strain of Arthrobacter sp. scl-2 and identification of the degradation pathway.	Isocarbophos is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide that has caused environmental pollution in many areas. However, degradation of isocarbophos by pure cultures has not been extensively studied, and the degradation pathway has not been determined. In this paper, a highly effective isocarbophos-degrading strain, scl-2, was isolated from isocarbophos-polluted soil. Strain scl-2 was preliminarily identified as Arthrobacter sp. based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rDNA analysis. Strain scl-2 could utilize isocarbophos as its sole source of carbon and phosphorus for growth. One hundred mg/l isocarbophos could be degraded to a nondetectable level in 18 h by scl-2 in cell culture, and isofenphos-methyl, profenofos, and phosmet could also be degraded. During the degradation of isocarbophos, the metabolites isopropyl salicylate, salicylate, and gentisate were detected and identified based on MS/MS analysis and their retention times in HPLC	2010	6	16	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Dioxygenases; Insecticides; Malathion; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Molecular Sequence Data; Organothiophosphates; Organothiophosphorus Compounds; Phosmet; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Salicylates; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Time Factors; cis-trans-Isomerases	Rong	Li
19959291	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.11.022	Complete degradation of di-n-octyl phthalate by biochemical cooperation between Gordonia sp. strain JDC-2 and Arthrobacter sp. strain JDC-32 isolated from activated sludge.	Two bacterial strains were isolated from activated sludge using mixtures of phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as the sole source of carbon and energy. One of the isolates was identified as Gordonia sp. strain JDC-2 and the other as Arthrobacter sp. strain JDC-32, mainly through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Gordonia sp. strain JDC-2 rapidly degraded di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) into phthalic acid (PA), which accumulated in the culture medium. Arthrobacter sp. strain JDC-32 degraded PA but not DOP. The co-culture of Gordonia sp. strain JDC-2 and Arthrobacter sp. strain JDC-32 degraded DOP completely by overcoming the degradative limitations of each species alone. The biochemical pathway of DOP degradation by Gordonia sp. strain JDC-2 was proposed based on the identified degradation intermediates. The results suggest that DOP is completely degraded by the biochemical cooperation of different microorganisms isolated from activated sludge.	2010	5	18	J Hazard Mater	Journal of hazardous materials	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Coculture Techniques; Gordonia Bacterium; Phthalic Acids; Sewage	Wu	Xueling

Four di-butyl-phthalate(DBP)-degrading bacterial strains, JDC-1, JDC-8, JDC-9 and JDC-12, were isolated from soil. The strains were gram positive. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis revealed that the four strains had similarities of 99% with Arthrobacter sp.. According to the morphologic, physiobiochemical characteristics and the analysis of their 16S rRNA, all the four strains were identified as Arthrobacter sp.. A 900 bp DNA fragment was obtained from the four strains by PCR amplified and clone. When compared with the large subunit of phthalate dioxygenase gene (phtA) of Arthrobacter keyseri, more than 96% similarities were evident in the nucleotide sequences. The optimal growth conditions and degradation rates of DBP were tested and the result indicated that the optimal growth conditions of the four bacteria strains were pH 7.0-8.5 and 30-35 degrees C.

We performed x-ray crystallographic analyses of the 6-aminohexanoate cyclic dimer (Acd) hydrolase (NylA) from Arthrobacter sp., an enzyme responsible for the degradation of the nylon-6 industry byproduct. The fold adopted by the 472-amino acid polypeptide generated a compact mixed alpha/beta fold, typically found in the amidase signature superfamily; this fold was especially similar to the fold of glutamyl-tRNA(Gln) amidotransferase subunit A (z score, 49.4) and malonamidase E2 (z score, 44.8). Irrespective of the high degree of structural similarity to the typical amidase signature superfamily enzymes, the specific activity of NylA for glutamine, malonamide, and indoleacetamide was found to be lower than 0.5% of that for Acd. However, NylA possessed carboxylesterase activity nearly equivalent to the Acd hydrolytic activity.

Cells exhibited a rod-coccus growth cycle and produced a yellow pigment. Growth occurred at 1-25 degrees C. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain S6-3(T) was related to members of the genus Arthrobacter, sharing highest sequence similarities with the type strains of Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus (97.9 %) and Arthrobacter stackebrandtii (97.6 %). Strain S6-3(T) had MK-9(H(2)) as the major menaquinone and anteiso-C(15 : 0) as the major fatty acid. The cell-wall peptidoglycan was of type A3alpha l-Lys-l-Thr-Ala(3).

Arthrobacter sp. strain IF1 is able to grow on 4-fluorophenol (4-FP) as a sole source of carbon and energy. To clone the 4-FP degradation genes, DNA libraries were constructed and screened with a probe obtained by PCR using primers designed on the basis of conserved regions of aromatic two-component monooxygenases. Sequencing of positive clones yielded two gene clusters, each harboring a gene encoding a monooxygenase with high sequence similarity to the oxygenase component of 4-nitrophenol and 4-chlorophenol monooxygenase systems. Both these monooxygenase genes were differentially expressed during growth on 4-FP, as revealed by Northern blotting and reverse transcription-PCR. One cluster also contained a gene for a flavin reductase. The monooxygenase and reductase were purified from Escherichia coli cells expressing the corresponding genes, and together they catalyzed NADH-dependent hydroxylation and dehalogenation of 4-halophenols.

The genome of Arthrobacter sp. strain FB24 contains a chromate resistance determinant (CRD), consisting of a cluster of 8 genes located on a 10.6 kb fragment of a 96 kb plasmid. The CRD includes chrA, which encodes a putative chromate efflux protein, and three genes with amino acid similarities to the amino and carboxy termini of ChrB, a putative regulatory protein. There are also three novel genes that have not been previously associated with chromate resistance in other bacteria; they encode an oxidoreductase (most similar to malate:quinone oxidoreductase), a functionally unknown protein with a WD40 repeat domain and a lipoprotein. To delineate the contribution of the CRD genes to the FB24 chromate [Cr(VI)] response, we evaluated the growth of mutant strains bearing regions of the CRD and transcript expression levels in response to Cr(VI) challenge.

To evaluate the use of Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus PCR (ERIC-PCR)-derived probes and primers to specifically detect bacterial strains in an activated sludge microbial community. ERIC-PCR was performed on two phenol-degrading bacterial strains, Arthrobacter nicotianae P1-7 and Klebsiella sp. P8-14. Their amplicons were DIG labelled for use as probes and then hybridized with ERIC-PCR fingerprints. The results showed the distinct band patterns for both bacterial strains. Strain-specific PCR primers were designed based on the sequences of ERIC-PCR bands.

19701667	10.1007/s00284-009-9464-1	Genetic diversity of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria isolated from rhizospheric soil of wheat under saline condition.	In this study, a total of 130 rhizobacteria was isolated from a saline infested zone of wheat rhizosphere, and screened for plant growth promoting (PGP) traits at higher salt (NaCl) concentrations (2, 4, 6, and 8%). The results revealed that 24 rhizobacterial isolates were tolerant at 8% NaCl. Although all the 24 salt tolerable isolates produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), while 10 isolates solubilized phosphorus, eight produced siderophore, and six produced gibberellin. However, only three isolates showed the production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Diversity was analyzed through 16S rDNA-RFLP, and of these isolates with three tetra cutter restriction enzymes (HaeIII, AluI, and MspI), the representative cluster groups were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. Bacillus and Bacillus-derived genera were dominant which showed PGP attributes at 8% NaCl concentration.

A tropical soil from a Kenyan sugarcane-cultivated field showed a very high capability to mineralize (14)C-ring-labeled atrazine. In laboratory experiments this soil mineralized about 90% of the applied atrazine within 98 d. The atrazine-degrading microbial community was enriched in liquid cultures containing atrazine as the sole N source and 100 mgL(-1) glucose as additional C source. From the enrichment culture a bacterial strain was isolated and identified by comparative sequence analysis of the 16S-rDNA as member of the genus Arthrobacter. The enriched mixed culture as well as the isolated strain, designated as Arthrobacter sp. strain GZK-1, could grow on atrazine and terbuthylazine as sole N-sources; Arthrobacter sp. GZK-1 mineralized (14)C-ring-labeled atrazine up to 88% to (14)CO(2) and (14)C-ring-labeled terbuthylazine up to 65% to (14)CO(2) in a liquid culture within 14 d.

To assess the effects of bacterial treatment at the earliest stages of cod rearing on the microbial load, larval development and performance, testing three bacterial strains (Carnobacterium divergens V41, Arthrobacter sp. and Enterococcus sp.) in vivo that were previously shown to have inhibitory potential towards fish pathogens in vitro. A bacterial mixture was added eight times to the rearing water from the prehatch to the mid-larval stage (a 38-day period). Microbiological analysis of ova, larvae and rearing water was performed regularly. Larval performance and development were evaluated by survival rate, hypersalinity tolerance and physiological measurements. Different larval survival rates were observed within and between treatments, and possibly explained by variations in larval microflora and established probionts. Larvae from one silo, which had been bathed in the bacterial suspension, showed the highest survival rate (42.1%), lowest Vibrio levels, and were significantly heavie	2010	7	13	J Appl Microbiol	Journal of applied microbiology	Animals; Arthrobacter; Carnobacterium; Colony Count, Microbial; Enterococcus; Gadus morhua; Intestines; Larva; Probiotics	Lauzon	H L

The ability to examine real-time reaction kinetics for multimeric enzymes in their native state may offer unique insights into understanding the catalytic mechanism and its interplay with three-dimensional structure. In this study, we have used a time-resolved electrospray mass spectrometry approach to probe the kinetic mechanism of 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A (4-HBA-CoA) thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU in the millisecond time domain. Intact tetrameric complexes of 4-HBA-CoA thioesterase with up to four natural substrate (4-HBA-CoA) molecules bound were detected at times as early as 6 ms using an online rapid-mixing device directly coupled to an electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Species corresponding to the formation of a folded tetramer of the thioesterase at charge states 16+, 17+, 18+, and 19+ around m/z 3800 were observed and assigned as individual tetramers of thioesterase and noncovalent complexes of the tetramers with up to four substrate and	2009	11	13	Anal Biochem	Analytical biochemistry	Arthrobacter; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Coenzyme A; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Ligands; Mass Spectrometry; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Weight; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization; Substrate Specificity; Thiolester Hydrolases	Li	Zhili

The development of a new cold-active beta-D-galactosidases and microorganisms that efficiently ferment lactose is of high biotechnological interest, particularly for lactose removal in milk and dairy products at low temperatures and for cheese whey bioremediation processes with simultaneous bio-ethanol production. In this article, we present a new beta-D-galactosidase as a candidate to be applied in the above mentioned biotechnological processes. The gene encoding this beta-D-galactosidase has been isolated from the genomic DNA library of Antarctic bacterium Arthrobacter sp. 32c, sequenced, cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. 27 mg of beta-D-galactosidase was purified from 1 L of culture with the use of an intracellular E. coli expression system.

Amongst more than 1000 isolates collected in various cold environments, the strain Arthrobacter psychrolactophilus Sp 31.3 has been selected for its ability to grow and to produce exoenzymes at low temperatures, its inability to grow at 37 degrees C, its non-halophilic character and its growth versatility on various media. This non-pathogenic strain displays a strong resistance to desiccation and storage at room temperature and is suitable for the production of freeze-dried bacterial starters. When grown in a synthetic wastewater at 10 degrees C, the strain induces a complete clarification of the turbid medium and efficiently hydrolyses proteins, starch and lipids in the broth. Furthermore, this strain has a remarkable capacity to improve the biodegradability of organic compounds in wastewater as indicated by a BOD(5)/COD ratio of 0.7.	2009	11	16	Extremophiles	Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions	Acclimatization; Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Cold Climate; Kinetics; Waste Disposal, Fluid	Gratia	Emmanuelle
19540107	10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.056	Isolation and characterization of Arthrobacter sp. HY2 capable of degrading a high concentration of p-nitrophenol.	A soil bacterium strain, capable of using p-nitrophenol (PNP) as its sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated by enrichment on minimal salt medium (MSM). On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences the bacterium is a species of Arthrobacter, closely related to Arthrobacter ureafaciens DSM 20126. This strain has an unusually high substrate tolerance for PNP degradation in MSM. Greatest degradation of PNP was observed at 30 degrees C and under slightly alkaline pH (pH 7-9) conditions. Effective degradation rates slowed as the concentration of PNP was increased. Addition of glucose from 0.1% to 0.5% generally enhanced the degradation of PNP at high concentration (400 mg/l) although acidification as a result of glucose metabolism had a negative effect on PNP depletion. Biodegradation of PNP at high concentration was greatly accelerated by beta-cyclodextrin at a concentration of 0.5%, indicating that beta-cyclodextrin could be a promising addictive for effective	2009	9	28	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Culture Media; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Nitrophenols; Temperature; beta-Cyclodextrins	Qiu	Xinghui

The ability of free and polysulphone immobilized biomass of Arthrobacter sp. to remove Cu(2+) ions from aqueous solution was studied in batch and continuous systems. The Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to the data. The Langmuir isotherm model was found to fit the sorption data indicating that sorption was monolayer and uptake capacity (Q(o)) was 175.87 and 158.7mg/g for free and immobilized biomass respectively at pH 5.0 and 30 degrees C temperature, which was also confirmed by a high correlation coefficient, a low RMSE and a low Chi-square value. A kinetic study was carried out with pseudo-first-order reaction and pseudo-second-order reaction equations and it was found that the Cu(2+) uptake process followed the pseudo-second-order rate expression. The diffusivity of Cu(2+) on immobilized beads increased (0.402x10(-4) to 0.435x10(-4)cm(2)/s) with increasing concentration from 50 to 150mg/L.

19482928	10.1128/JB.00307-09	Identification of a novel self-sufficient styrene monooxygenase from Rhodococcus opacus 1CP.	Sequence analysis of a 9-kb genomic fragment of the actinobacterium Rhodococcus opacus 1CP led to identification of an open reading frame encoding a novel fusion protein, StyA2B, with a putative function in styrene metabolism via styrene oxide and phenylacetic acid. Gene cluster analysis indicated that the highly related fusion proteins of Nocardia farcinica IFM10152 and Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 are involved in a similar physiological process. Whereas 413 amino acids of the N terminus of StyA2B are highly similar to those of the oxygenases of two-component styrene monooxygenases (SMOs) from pseudomonads, the residual 160 amino acids of the C terminus show significant homology to the flavin reductases of these systems. Cloning and functional expression of His(10)-StyA2B revealed for the first time that the fusion protein does in fact catalyze two separate reactions.

The effect of mustard gas hydrolysis products (MGHPs) on marine microbiota and the ability of microorganisms to degrade MGHPs were studied. Many stations at the dump sites demonstrated reduced microbial diversity, and increased growth of species able to use mustard gas hydrolysis products as sole source of carbon. Significant amounts of MGHP-degrading bacteria were revealed in the near-bottom water. The MGHP-degrading microorganisms identified as Achromobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Arthrobacter sp. were isolated. These microorganisms were capable of utilizing the major product of hydrolysis, thiodiglycol, as the sole source of carbon and energy. The bacteria were capable of metabolizing MGHPs at a low temperature. The metabolic pathway for thiodiglycol degradation was proposed.

Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) have been installed at automotive plants to treat metalworking fluid (MWF) wastewaters, which are known to contain toxic and/or recalcitrant organic compounds. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate treatment of a simulated wastewater prepared from a semisynthetic MWF, which contains two such compounds, dicyclohexylamine (DCHA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Primary findings were as follows: During stable operating periods, almost all chemical oxygen demand (COD), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and EDTA were removed (by &gt; 96%). During somewhat unstable periods, COD removal was still extremely robust, but removal of EDTA and TKN were sensitive to prolonged episodes of low dissolved oxygen.

In this work, lipase from Arthrobacter sp. was immobilized by sol-gel encapsulation to improve its catalytic properties. Various silanizing agents including vinyl-trimethoxy silane, octyl-trimethoxy silane, gamma-(methacryloxypropyl)-trimethoxy silane (MAPTMS) and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) were chosen as the precursors. Among them, MAPTMS was for the first time utilized to encapsulate lipases, and the prepared enzyme by copolymerization of MAPTMS and TEOS exhibited the highest activity in both the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl palmitate and the asymmetric acylation of 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-(2-propenyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one. The effects of various immobilization parameters were investigated. Under the optimum conditions of MAPTMS/TEOS=1/1 (mol/mol), water/silane molar ratio (R value)=20 and lipase loading=0.01 g/mL sol, the total activity of the immobilized enzyme reached up to 13.6-fold of the free form.

The genes encoding omega-laurolactam hydrolases from Cupriavidus sp. T7, Acidovorax sp. T31, Cupriavidus sp. U124, and Sphingomonas sp. U238 were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis of the four genes indicated that the primary structures of these omega-laurolactam hydrolases are significantly similar to the 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase (EC 3.5.2.12). These genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the omega-laurolactam hydrolysing activity of the recombinant enzymes was compared with that of 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase from Arthrobacter sp. KI72. The enzyme from Acidovorax sp. T31 was most successfully expressed in E. coli. Cell-free extract of the recombinant strain was used for the synthesis of 12-aminolauric acid from omega-laurolactam by "enzymatic transcrystallization," because crystalline omega-laurolactam added into the enzyme solution was converted to crystalline 12-aminolauric acid (&gt; or =97.3% yield).

This work intended to study the relationship between diuron herbicide dissipation and the population dynamics of co-cultivated Delftia acidovorans WDL34 (WDL34) and Arthrobacter sp. N4 (N4) for different cell formulations: free cells or immobilization in Ca-alginate beads of one or both strains. GFP-tagged WDL34 and N4 Gram staining allowed analyzing the cell growth and distribution of each strain in both beads and culture medium in the course of the time. Compared to the free cell co-culture of WDL34 and N4, immobilization of WDL34 in Ca-alginate beads co-cultivated with free N4 increased the dissipation rate of diuron by 53% (0.141 mg ml(-1) h(-1)). In that case, immobilization strongly modified the final equilibrium among both strains (highest total N4 to WDL34 ratio).

For evaluating N(2) fixation of diazotrophic bacteria, nitrogen-poor liquid media supplemented with at least 0.5% sugar and 0.2% agar are widely used for acetylene reduction assays. In such a soft gel medium, however, many N(2)-fixing soil bacteria generally show only trace acetylene reduction activity. Here, we report that use of a N(2) fixation medium solidified with gellan gum instead of agar promoted growth of some gellan-preferring soil bacteria.

19231868	10.1021/pr800705f	Global proteomic analysis of the chromate response in Arthrobacter sp. strain FB24.	A global proteomic evaluation of the response of Arthrobacter sp. strain FB24 to 5 and 20 mM Cr(VI) was conducted using both two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS). The changes in protein expression found with 2-DGE indicate alterations in central metabolism and amino acid synthesis. Proteome coverage increased from 22% with 2-DGE to 71% with LC/LC-MS/MS. The proteins exhibiting the highest levels of expression under Cr(VI) stress suggest intracellular sulfur limitation, which could be driven by competition for the sulfate (SO4(2-)) transporter by the chromate (CrO4(2-)) ion. These results are consistent with the growth defects seen with strain FB24 when Cr(VI) concentrations exceeded 5 mM.	2009	10	1	J Proteome Res	Journal of proteome research	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Chromates; Chromatography, Liquid; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Proteome; Tandem Mass Spectrometry	Henne	Kristene L

The chemolithoautotroph, Arthrobacter sp.15b oxidizes arsenite to arsenate using a membrane bound arsenite oxidase. The enzyme arsenite oxidase is purified to its homogeneity and identified using MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Upon further characterization, it was observed that the enzyme is a heterodimer showing native molecular mass as approximately 100 kDa and appeared as two subunits of approximately 85 kDa LSU and 14 kDa SSU on SDS-PAGE. The V(max) and K(m) values of the enzyme was found to be 2.45 microM (AsIII)/min/mg) and 26 microM, respectively. The purified enzyme could withstand wide range of pH and temperature changes. The enzyme, however, gets deactivated in the presence of 1 mM of DEPC suggesting the involvement of histidine at the binding site of the enzyme.

19193103	10.1021/bi802165x	Preferential hydrolysis of aberrant intermediates by the type II thioesterase in Escherichia coli nonribosomal enterobactin synthesis: substrate specificities and mutagenic studies on the active-site residues.	The type II thioesterase EntH is a hotdog fold protein required for optimal nonribosomal biosynthesis of enterobactin in Escherichia coli. Its proposed proofreading activity in the biosynthesis is confirmed by its efficient restoration of enterobactin synthesis blocked in vitro by analogs of the cognate precursor 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. Steady-state kinetic studies show that EntH recognizes the phosphopantetheine group and the pattern of hydroxylation in the aryl moiety of its thioester substrates. Remarkably, it is able to distinguish aberrant intermediates from the normal one in the enterobactin assembly line by demonstrating at least 10-fold higher catalytic efficiency toward thioesters derived from aberrant aryl precursors without a para-hydroxyl group, such as salicylate. By structural comparison and site-directed mutagenesis, the thioesterase is found to possess an active site closely resembling that of the 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU and to i	2010	6	24	Biochemistry	Biochemistry	Amino Acids; Catalytic Domain; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enterobactin; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Fatty Acid Synthases; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydrolysis; Hydroxybenzoates; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutant Proteins; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Ribosomes; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Thiolester Hydrolases	Guo	Zu-Feng
19156367	10.1007/s12010-008-8494-7	Biodegradation of mixed phenolic compounds under high salt conditions and salinity fluctuations by Arthrobacter sp. W1.	High salt concentration and salinity fluctuations in wastewater challenge the efficiency of microbial strains used for cleanup of pollutants. In this study, it was investigated that the new isolated Arthrobacter sp. W1 degraded mixed phenolic compounds under complex salt conditions. The results showed that Arthrobacter sp. W1 was able to utilize various phenolic compounds as carbon source under high salt conditions. It can degrade phenol and p-cresol mixture at 10% NaCl, although rates of degradation and cell growth were lower compared to 5% NaCl. The presence of trace p-cresol significantly inhibited phenol biodegradation. When salinity fluctuations were between 1% and 10% NaCl, strain W1 was able to degrade substrates and survived. It was also suggested that the presence of salts (i.e., NaCl, KCl, Na(2)SO(4), and K(2)SO(4)) had almost no effects on the microbial growth and biodegradation process. Therefore, Arthrobacter sp.

Dissipation kinetics of mesotrione, a new triketone herbicide, sprayed on soil from Limagne (Puy-de-D..me, France) showed that the soil microflora were able to biotransform it. Bacteria from this soil were cultured in mineral salt solution supplemented with mesotrione as sole source of carbon for the isolation of mesotrione-degrading bacteria. The bacterial community structure of the enrichment cultures was analyzed by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). The TTGE fingerprints revealed that mesotrione had an impact on bacterial community structure only at its highest concentrations and showed mesotrione-sensitive and mesotrione-adapted strains. Two adapted strains, identified as Bacillus sp. and Arthrobacter sp., were isolated by colony hybridization methods. Biodegradation assays showed that only the Bacillus sp. strain was able to completely and rapidly biotransform mesotrione.

The enzyme consists of four subunits with a total molecular weight of 190 kDa. The polyamidase cleaved amide and ester bonds of water insoluble model substrates like adipic acid bishexylamide and bis(benzoyloxyethyl)terephthalate and hydrolyzed different soluble amides to the corresponding acid. Treatment of polyamide 6 with this amidase led to an increased hydrophilicity based on rising height and tensiometry measurements and evidence of surface hydrolysis of polyamide 6 is shown. In addition to amidase activity, the enzyme showed activity on p-nitrophenylbutyrate. On hexanoamide the amidase exhibited a K(m) value of 5.5 mM compared to 0.07 mM for p-nitroacetanilide. The polyamidase belongs to the amidase signature family and is closely related to aryl acylamidases from different strains/species of Nocardia and to the 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic dimer hydrolase (EI) from Arthrobacter sp.

Arthrobacter arilaitensis is one of the major bacterial species found at the surface of cheeses, especially in smear-ripened cheeses, where it contributes to the typical colour, flavour and texture properties of the final product. The A. arilaitensis Re117 genome is composed of a 3,859,257 bp chromosome and two plasmids of 50,407 and 8,528 bp. The chromosome shares large regions of synteny with the chromosomes of three environmental Arthrobacter strains for which genome sequences are available: A. aurescens TC1, A. chlorophenolicus A6 and Arthrobacter sp. FB24. In contrast however, 4.92% of the A. arilaitensis chromosome is composed of ISs elements, a portion that is at least 15 fold higher than for the other Arthrobacter strains. Comparative genomic analyses reveal an extensive loss of genes associated with catabolic activities, presumably as a result of adaptation to the properties of the cheese surface habitat.

20838774	10.1007/s00203-010-0625-1	The catalytic efficiency of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase is effected by the N-loop at low temperatures.	The enzyme OtsA (trehalose-6-phosphate synthase) is ubiquitous in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, where it plays a critical role in stress resistance and glucose metabolism. Here, we cloned the otsA gene from Arthrobacter sp. Cjts, and expressed and then purified the recombinant proteins. Enzyme activity analysis indicated that the high catalytic efficiency of OtsA from Arthrobacter sp. Cjts resulted from the high affinity of the enzyme for uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc) at low temperatures. We also confirmed that the N-loop sequence of OtsA has a large effect on its affinity for UDP-Glc. Sequence analysis indicated that the flexibility of the N-loop may be directly related to the catalytic efficiency of OtsA at low temperatures.	2010	11	24	Arch Microbiol	Archives of microbiology	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Cold Temperature; Genes, Bacterial; Glucosyltransferases; Molecular Sequence Data; Recombinant Proteins; Uridine Diphosphate Glucose	Jiang	Ying
20833430	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2010.08.033	Phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: Contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.	The rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (Vicia faba), beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and tomato, (Lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Exiquobacterium aurantiacum, Pseudomonas veronii, Micrococcus luteus, Brevibacillus brevis, Arthrobacter sp. and Flavobacterium psychrophilum. These rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of N(2) fixation, which makes them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil.

To isolate bacteria capable of degrading endosulfan (ES) and the more toxic ES sulfate and to characterize their metabolites. A Pseudomonas sp. strain IITR01 capable of degrading ..-ES and toxic ES sulfate was isolated using technical-ES through enrichment culture techniques. No growth and no degradation were observed using ..-ES. Thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrum analysis revealed the disappearance of both ..-ES and ES sulfate and the formation of hydroxylated products ES diol, ether and lactone. We show here for the first time the formation of aforementioned metabolites in contrast to ES hemisulfate yielded by an Arthrobacter sp. Metabolism of ..-ES and endosulfate was also observed using the crude cell extract of IITR01. The molecular mass of protein induced during the degradation of ..-ES and sulfate as substrate was found to be approximately 150 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

20686824	10.1007/s10653-010-9337-3	Isolation and characterization of an Arthrobacter sp. strain HB-5 that transforms atrazine.	A bacterial strain (HB-5) capable of utilizing atrazine as sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth was isolated from an industrial wastewater sample by enrichment culture. The isolate was identified as Arthrobacter sp. according to its phenotypic features, physiologic and biochemical characteristics, and phylogenetic analysis. The strain exhibited faster atrazine degradation rates in atrazine-containing mineral media than the well-characterized atrazine-degrading bacteria Pseudomonas sp. ADP. The broad optimum pH and temperature ranges observed for strain HB-5 indicate that it has potential for remediation of atrazine-contaminated sites. Strain HB-5 first metabolizes atrazine to yield hydroxyatrazine. Then, the bacterium metabolizes hydroxyatrazine to cyanuric acid, but could not mineralize atrazine.	2011	8	29	Environ Geochem Health	Environmental geochemistry and health	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; China; Genes, Bacterial; Herbicides; Industrial Waste; Molecular Sequence Data; Nitrogen; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Water Pollutants	Wang	Jinhua

Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have generated excitement in environmental and bioenergy communities due to their potential for coupling wastewater treatment with energy generation and powering diverse devices. The pursuit of strategies such as improving microbial cultivation practices and optimizing MFC devices has increased power generating capacities of MFCs. However, surprisingly few microbial species with electrochemical activity in MFCs have been identified because current devices do not support parallel analyses or high throughput screening. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using advanced microfabrication methods to fabricate an MFC microarray. Here, we extend these studies by demonstrating a microfabricated air-cathode MFC array system. The system contains 24 individual air-cathode MFCs integrated onto a single chip. The device enables the direct and parallel comparison of different microbes loaded onto the array.

With the improvement of living standard and civil building innovation, large numbers of building materials and decoration are being used. The emission of gaseous organic pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, toluene and xylene from these materials may trigger immediate or persistent potential harm to human health. In this study, with the combination of bake-out exhaust, biological treatment was applied to deal with volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Four bacterial strains were isolated from the biotrickling filter and were identified according to physiological and biochemical tests as well as bacterial fatty acids. As a result, they were characterized as Pseudomonas sp., Kocuria sp., Arthrobacter sp. and Bacillus sp. Under the conditions of gaseous flow rate of 600 L/h, surface liquid velocity of 3.14 m/h, pH 6-7 and temperature of 30 degrees C, VOCs could be degraded by using biological method before they were exhausted to the environment.

Assessment of high-density polyethylene (HDPE)-degrading bacteria isolated from plastic waste dumpsites of Gulf of Mannar. Rationally, 15 bacteria (GMB1-GMB15) were isolated by enrichment technique. GMB5 and GMB7 were selected for further studies based on their efficiency to degrade the HDPE and identified as Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp., respectively. Assessed weight loss of HDPE after 30 days of incubation was nearly 12% for Arthrobacter sp. and 15% for Pseudomonas sp. The bacterial adhesion to hydrocarbon (BATH) assay showed that the cell surface hydrophobicity of Pseudomonas sp. was higher than Arthrobacter sp. Both fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and protein content of the biofilm were used to test the viability and protein density of the biomass.

20553043	10.1021/es100117f	Influence of pH and inorganic phosphate on toxicity of zinc to Arthrobacter sp. isolated from heavy-metal-contaminated sediments.	Because of its high solubility over a wide range of pH conditions, zinc is found in many natural and human-impacted systems. Zinc speciation is critical in assessing zinc toxicity to microorganisms because it varies considerably with pH and is dependent on other aqueous constituents. Combined results of thermodynamic modeling, statistical analysis, and batch culture studies using Arthrobacter sp. JM018 suggest that the toxic species may not be solely limited to the free ion, but also includes ZnHPO(4)(0)(aq). Cellular uptake of ZnHPO(4)(0)(aq) through the inorganic phosphate transporter (Pit family), which requires a neutral metal phosphate complex for phosphate transport, may explain the observed toxicity. Based on visual MINTEQ (v3.0) modeling, at 50 ..M total zinc, ZnHPO(4)(0)(aq) constitutes 33, 70, and 76% of the neutral metal phosphate pool at pH 6, 7, and 8, respectively.

Several bacterial strains isolated from granitic rock material in front of the Damma glacier (Central Swiss Alps) were shown (i) to grow in the presence of granite powder and a glucose-NH(4)Cl minimal medium without additional macro- or micronutrients and (ii) to produce weathering-associated agents. In particular, four bacterial isolates (one isolate each of Arthrobacter sp., Janthinobacterium sp., Leifsonia sp., and Polaromonas sp.) were weathering associated. In comparison to what was observed in abiotic experiments, the presence of these strains caused a significant increase of granite dissolution (as measured by the release of Fe, Ca, K, Mg, and Mn). These most promising weathering-associated bacterial species exhibited four main features rendering them more efficient in mineral dissolution than the other investigated isolates: (i) a major part of their bacterial cells was attached to the granite surfaces and not suspended in solution, (ii) they secreted the largest amounts of oxa	2010	10	6	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Ammonia; Bacteria; Bacterial Adhesion; Culture Media; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Glucose; Hydrogen Cyanide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ice Cover; Metals; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxalic Acid; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Silicon Dioxide; Soil Microbiology; Switzerland	Frey	Beat

Hyperuricemia is a condition of defective purine metabolism characterized with elevated serum uric acid (UA) level that further leads to gout and gouty nephrolithiasis disorders. Gout is a world wide distributed rheumatic disease comprises 1% of the total population and still is in increasing state. One of the factors contributing to overproduction of UA is the hydroxylation of xanthine catalyzed by xanthine oxidase (XO). In the present study, 3D modeling of Arthrobacter sp.

The enzyme-aggregate coating method was performed to immobilize Arthrobacter sp. lipase in order to achieve better catalytic properties comparable to the conventional covalent attachment and covalent attachment plus cross-linking. The glutaraldehyde-activated amino-silica gel which was synthesized by sol-gel technique was used as the support, and the catalytic characteristics of the lipase preparations were tested in the asymmetric acylation of 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-(2-propenyl)-2-cyclopenten-1-one (HMPC) in organic solvents. The results showed that the immobilized lipase by enzyme-aggregate coating possessed both higher activity and stability than those by other methods, e.g. it obtained an activity of 82.6 U/g and remained 42% and 93% of the original activity after incubation in vinyl acetate at 60 degrees C for 16 h and 9 times recycles, respectively, while the covalently attached lipase got an activity of 67.4 U/g and left 33% and 73% of the original under the same conditions, and t	2010	8	20	Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces	Colloids and surfaces.

The Corynebacterium glutamicum gene cg2091 is encoding a polyphosphate (PolyP)/ATP-dependent glucokinase (PPGK). Previous work demonstrated the association of PPGK to PolyP granules. The deduced amino acid sequence of PPGK shows 45% sequence identity to PolyP/ATP glucomannokinase of Arthrobacter sp. strain KM and 50% sequence identity to PolyP glucokinase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. PPGK from C. glutamicum was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli. PolyP was highly preferred over ATP and other NTPs as substrate and with respect to the tested PolyPs differing in chain length; the protein was most active with PolyP(75). Gel filtration analysis revealed that PolyP supported the formation of homodimers of PPGK and that PPGK was active as a homodimer. A ppgK deletion mutant (Delta ppgK) showed slowed growth in minimal medium with maltose as sole carbon source. Moreover, in minimal medium containing 2 to 4% (w/v) glucose as carbon source, Delta ppgK grew to lower final biomass 	2010	9	27	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Adenosine Triphosphate; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Dimerization; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphotransferases; Phylogeny; Polyphosphates; Sequence Alignment; Substrate Specificity	Lindner	Steffen N
20372034		Arthrobacter sp. strain KU001 isolated from a Thai soil degrades atrazine in the presence of inorganic nitrogen sources.	An atrazine degrading bacterium, strain KU001, was obtained from a sugarcane field at the Cane and Sugar Research and Development Center at the Kasetsart University, Kamphaeng Saen campus, Thailand. Strain KU001 had a rod-to-coccus morphological cycle during growth. Biolog carbon source analysis indicated that the isolated bacterium was Arthrobacter histidinolovorans. Sequence analysis of PCR product indicated the 16S rRNA gene in strain KU001 was 99% identical to the same region in Arthrobacter sp.. The atrazine degradation pathway in strain KU001 consists of the catabolic genes, trzN, atzB and, atzC. Strain KU001 was able to use atrazine as a sole nitrogen source for growth, and surprisingly, atrazine degradation was not inhibited in cells grown on ammonium, nitrate or urea, as compared to cells cultivated on growth-limiting nitrogen sources. During the atrazine degradation process, the supplementation of nitrate completely inhibits atrazine degradation activity in strain KU001, wher	2010	7	27	J Microbiol Biotechnol	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; DNA, Bacterial; Herbicides; Nitrates; Nitrogen Compounds; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Thailand; Urea	Sajjaphan	Kannika

20184312	10.1021/es9031858	C, N, and H isotope fractionation of the herbicide isoproturon reflects different microbial transformation pathways.	The fate of pesticides in the subsurface is of great interest to the public, industry, and regulatory authorities. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) is a promising tool complementary to existing methods for elucidating pesticide degradation reactions. Here, we address three different initial biotransformation reactions of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon (3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea) in pure culture experiments with bacterial and fungal strains. When analyzing isotopic changes in different parts of the isoproturon molecule, hydroxylation of the isopropyl group by fungi was found to be associated with C and H isotope fractionation. In contrast, hydrolysis by Arthrobacter globiformis D47 caused strong C and N isotope fractionation, albeit in a different manner than abiotic hydrolysis so that isotope measurements can distinguish between both modes of transformation. No significant isotope fractionation was observed during N-demethylation by Sphingomonas sp. SRS2.

Among the various bioactive compounds, biosurfactant (BS)/bioemulsifiers (BE) are attracting major interest and attention due to their structural and functional diversity. The versatile properties of surface active molecules find numerous applications in various industries. Marine microorganisms such as Acinetobacter, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Myroides, Corynebacteria, Bacillus, Alteromonas sp. have been studied for production of BS/BE and exopolysaccharides (EPS).

Yields of activated sludge and an Arthrobacter sp. biomass on organic xenobiotic 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and on the intermediates of selected 2,4-D metabolism pathways were measured. Activated sludge yield on 2,4-D was lower by approximately 24-45% compared to the combined yields produced separately by the lower intermediates. For activated sludge, cell synthesis only consumed 33% of the electrons generated from 2,4-D oxidation, while the other 67% were used for energy. The high energy consumption, which was the primary cause of low activated sludge yield from 2,4-D degradation, occurred mainly in the catabolism of 2,4-D. The degrader sludge supplied this catabolism energy demand with the ATP contained in the biomass. As a result, the sludge's ATP contents suffered a deficit that was not fully remunerated after 2,4-D was degraded. Metabolism of the lower intermediates provided materials for further biomass growth and refilled part of the energy initially consumed.	2010	6	2	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid; Acclimatization; Adenosine Triphosphate; Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Chlorophenols; Electrons; Glyoxylates; Sewage; Thermodynamics; Xenobiotics	Chong	Nyuk-Min

Membrane fouling results in flux decline or transmembrane pressure drop increase during membrane bioreactor (MBR) operation. Physical and chemical cleanings are essential to keep an MBR operating at an appropriate membrane flux. Considerable residual membrane permeability loss that cannot be removed by conventional cleaning requires membrane replacement. This study demonstrates that an internal biofilm can develop inside a hollow-fiber membrane and can probably account for up to 58.9 and 81.3% of total membrane resistance for aerobic granular MBR operated in sequencing batch reactor (SBR) mode or continuous-fed mode, respectively. The Arthrobacter sp. (accession no.

A bioflocculant with high flocculating activity, LC13-SF, produced by strain LC13(T) which was in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, and which was woken up by Rpf (resuscitation promoting factor), was systematically investigated with regard to its fermentation conditions and flocculating activity. The key parameters influencing the bioflocculant LC13-SF were investigated through measuring the optical density at 660 (OD(660)) of the fermentation liquid and the optical density at 550 (OD(550)) of the centrifugal supernatant.

A plasmid named pDNS10 was detected from an atrazine-degrading strain Arthrobacter sp. DNS10 which has been isolated previously in our laboratory. In this paper, a special plasmid-detecting method and drop assays experiments were mainly used to achieve research goals. pDNS10 exhibited an excellent stability because it also could be detected even when the strain DNS10 has been subcultured under nonselective conditions for eight times. Over a 48-h incubation period, the OD(600) of samples inoculated with strain DNS10 and strain DNS10-ST (both of them contained pDNS10) were 0.31 .. 0.042 and 0.305 .. 0.034, respectively ,whereas the OD(600) of samples inoculated strain without pDNS10 (strain DNS10-PE) was only 0.138 .. 0.018. No atrazine was detected in the inoculated strain DNS10 and strain DNS10-ST samples at this period. Contrarily, the atrazine-degrading rate of strain DNS10-PE was only 5.23 .. 0.71%.

Himalayan soils undergo dramatic temporal changes in their microclimatic properties. The soil habitats in the high altitude cold habitats of Himalayas are little explored with respect to bacterial diversity and metabolic potentials of the bacterial species. Soil habitat in Western Himalayas is dominated by the genera of Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Flavobacterium. Strains were found to be diverse in their metabolic potentials to utilize different carbon sources by growing them on media containing 114 different sole carbon sources. Bacillus sp. STL9 was supported by the lowest number (12.3%) of the carbon sources while growth was observed in 73.7% of the carbon sources tested for the Pseudomonas sp. SPS2. Carbohydrates appeared to be preferred carbon sources for these Himalayan isolates followed by amino acids and proteins.

Taking the cow dung and straw as composting raw materials, effect of cellulose-decomposing strain on microbial community of cow manure compost was investigated with the traditional culture method and PCR-DGGE technique. The results showed that the microbiological inocula showed a more rapid rate of temperature elevation at the start of composting and prolonged the time of high-temperature process and increased the number of microbial. The DGGE map of cellulose-decomposing strain compost was different from natural compost, the succession of microbial community in cellulose-decomposing strain was faster than natural compost. Sequence comparison revealed that the Pseudomonas sp. of bacterial appeared at the initial stage and Acinetobacter sp., Flavobacteria were existed at the high-temperature process in natural compost; while Arthrobacter sp. was appeared at the high-temperature process in cellulose-decomposing strain compost.

22187439	10.1074/jbc.M111.321992	Three-dimensional structure of nylon hydrolase and mechanism of nylon-6 hydrolysis.	We performed x-ray crystallographic analyses of the 6-aminohexanoate oligomer hydrolase (NylC) from Agromyces sp. at 2.0 ..-resolution. This enzyme is a member of the N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase superfamily that is responsible for the degradation of the nylon-6 industry byproduct. We observed four identical heterodimers (27 kDa + 9 kDa), which resulted from the autoprocessing of the precursor protein (36 kDa) and which constitute the doughnut-shaped quaternary structure. The catalytic residue of NylC was identified as the N-terminal Thr-267 of the 9-kDa subunit. Furthermore, each heterodimer is folded into a single domain, generating a stacked ........ core structure. Amino acid mutations at subunit interfaces of the tetramer were observed to drastically alter the thermostability of the protein. In particular, four mutations (D122G/H130Y/D36A/E263Q) of wild-type NylC from Arthrobacter sp.

Organophosphorus pesticide (OP) hydrolases play key roles in the degradation and decontamination of agricultural and household OPs and in the detoxification of chemical warfare agents. In this study, an isofenphos-methyl hydrolase gene (imh) was cloned from the isocarbophos-degrading strain of Arthrobacter sp. scl-2 using the polymerase chain reaction method. Isofenphos-methyl hydrolase (Imh) showed 98% sequence identity with the isofenphos hydrolase from Arthrobacter sp. strain B-5. Imh was highly expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the His(6)-tagged Imh was purified (1.7 mg/ml) with a specific activity of 14.35 U/mg for the substrate isofenphos-methyl. The molecular mass of the denatured Imh is about 44 kDa, and the isoelectric point (pI) value was estimated to be 3.4. The optimal pH and temperature for hydrolysis of isofenphos-methyl were pH 8.0 and 35 ..C, respectively.

Halohydrin dehalogenases are attractive biocatalysts in producing a series of important chiral building blocks. Recombinant expression of halohydrin dehalogenase from Arthrobacter sp. AD2 (HheA) in Escherichia coli using T7 promoter-based pGEF(+) system revealed much lower expression level than that of the well-studied halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC). In this study, we changed the codon usage in the 5'-end of hheA gene to improve the expression yield of HheA. Our results showed that the expression of HheA could be largely improved by the replacement of G-rich +2 codon (adjacent to the start codon) with less G-containing codons. The expression of one of the resulting mutants HheA-D1 (replaced +2 codon GTG with CCA) was about 4-fold higher and purified yields about 8-fold greater than that of the wild-type HheA. Moreover, the expression level of the resulting HheA variants correlated well with the minimal folding free energy (..G) of the mRNA secondary s	2012	3	30	Enzyme Microb Technol	Enzyme and microbial technology	Arthrobacter; Base Sequence; Biotechnology; Codon; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Hydrolases; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Recombinant Proteins	Tang	Lixia

A protein fraction exhibiting 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (1-H2NA) dioxygenase activity was purified via ion exchange, hydrophobic interactions, and gel filtration chromatography from Arthrobacter phenanthrenivorans sp. nov. strain Sphe3 isolated from a Greek creosote-oil-polluted site. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and tandem MS (MS-MS) analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of oligopeptides of the major 45-kDa protein species, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, comprising 29% of the whole sequence, exhibited strong homology with 1-H2NA dioxygenase of Nocardioides sp. strain KP7. A BLAST search of the recently sequenced Sphe3 genome revealed two putative open reading frames, named diox1 and diox2, showing 90% nucleotide identity to each other and 85% identity at the amino acid level with the Nocardia sp. homologue. diox1 was found on an indigenous Sphe3 plasmid, whereas diox2 was located on the chromosome.	2012	5	10	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Arthrobacter; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, Liquid; DNA, Bacterial; Dioxygenases; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Environmental Microbiology; Environmental Pollution; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Greece; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Naphthols; Nocardia; Phenanthrenes; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Transcription, Genetic; Transcriptional Activation	Vandera	Elpiniki

A cryptic plasmid from Arthrobacter rhombi PRH1, designated as pPRH, was sequenced and characterized. It was 5000 bp in length with a G+C content of 66 mol%. The plasmid pPRH was predicted to encode six putative open reading frames (ORFs), in which ORF2 and ORF3 formed the minimal replicon of plasmid pPRH and shared 55-61% and 60-69% homology, respectively, with the RepA and RepB proteins of reported rhodococcal plasmids. Sequence analysis revealed a typical ColE2-type ori located 45 bp upstream of the gene repA. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis led to the conclusion that pPRH is a representative of a novel group of pAL5000 subfamily of ColE2 family plasmids. Three shuttle vectors pRMU824, pRMU824Km and pRMU824Tc, encoding chloramphenicol resistance, were constructed.

A novel (R)-amine transaminase, which catalyzed (R)-enantioselective transamination of chiral amine, was purified to homogeneity from Arthrobacter sp. KNK168 (FERM BP-5228). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 148 kDa by gel filtration and 37 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, suggesting a homotetrameric structure. The enzyme catalyzed transamination between amines and pyruvate stereo-specifically. The reaction on 1-methylbenzylamine was (R)-enantioselective. Pyruvate was the best amino acceptor, but the enzyme showed broad amino acceptor specificity for various ketone and aldehyde compounds. The apparent K(m)s for (R)-1-methylbenzylamine and pyruvate were 2.62 and 2.29 mM, respectively. The cloned gene of the enzyme consists of an open reading frame (ORF) of 993 bp encoding a protein of 330 amino acids, with a calculated molecular weight of 36,288.

SJCon, isolated from the soil of a pesticide contaminated site. This strain utilized 2C4NP as sole source of carbon and energy and degraded 2C4NP with stoichiometric release of nitrite and chloride ions. A metabolite was detected during the study of 2C4NP degradation and identified as chlorohydroquinone (CHQ) by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Inhibition study using 2,2'-dipyridyl showed that CHQ is a terminal aromatic compound in degradation pathway of 2C4NP. CHQ dioxygenase activity was observed in the crude extract of 2C4NP induced cells of the strain SJCon that suggested the cleavage of the CHQ to maleylacetate (MA). Our study clearly showed that Arthrobacter sp. SJCon degraded 2C4NP via formation of CHQ that further cleaved to MA by CHQ dioxygenase.

Tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), a flame retardant, is regarded as a potentially toxic and persistent environmental contaminant. We previously isolated a TDCPP-degrading bacterium, Sphingobium sp. strain TCM1, which, however, produced a toxic metabolite: 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (1,3-DCP). This study was undertaken to develop a technique for complete TDCPP detoxification using strain TCM1 with a 1,3-DCP-degrading bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. strain PY1. For efficient detoxification, we designed a resting cell system and examined the effect of freezing and lyophilization treatments for preparation of their resting cells. Results show that treatments had no marked adverse effect on their activities. The TDCPP dephosphorylation by TCM1 resting cells was optimal at 30..C and pH 8.5.

Developing a high-throughput screening method is of great importance for directed evolution of atrazine chlorohydrolase. A mutagenesis library of atzA from Pseudomonas sp. ADP and Arthrobacter sp. AD1 was constructed using error-prone PCR and DNA shuffling. Candidate mutants were screened through Haematococcus pluvialis expression system, using atrazine as selection pressure. Sequence analysis showed that mutations in the obtained 12 mutants with enhanced activity were all point-substitutions and scattered throughout the gene. Enzymatic activity analysis showed that the mutants all had higher activities than that of the wild type. The activities were 1.8-3.6 fold of the wild-type enzyme when cultured in BBM medium with 1 mg/L atrazine, whereas 1.8-2.6 fold with 2 mg/L atrazine. These results indicated that Haematococcus pluvialis expression system is an ideal high throughput screening system for directed evolution of atrazine chlorohydrolase.	2013	1	14	Sheng Wu Gong Cheng Xue Bao	Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology	Amidohydrolases; Atrazine; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chlorophyta; Herbicides; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Hydrolases; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Pseudomonas	Wang	Huizhuan

Application of Ruditapes Philippinarum conglutination mud (RPM) for decolorizing synthetic dye solutions was studied. RPM showed good activity for decolorization of Methylene Blue, Crystal Violet, Malachite Green, and Ink Blue. The amount of the RPM had great effect on the decoloration rate of the dye solutions. However, the decoloration rate did not continue to increase when the amount of mud exceeded the optimum dose. The temperature of the dye solution had a remarkable effect on the decolorization rate of Ink Blue solution, but had little effect on the other three dye solutions. The initial pH of the dye solutions evidently affected the decolorization rate of Malachite Green solution, but had less effect on the other three. The decolorization rate of the dye solutions increased significantly with treatment time within 8 hr, but tended to be steady after 8 hr for Methylene Blue, Crystal Violet and Malachite Green solutions, and after 12 hr for Ink Blue solution.

A novel actinomycete strain, designated CW 59T, was isolated from a polluted forest soil sample in Anhui Province, China. Cells were strictly aerobic, non-motile, bent rods. The strain grew optimally at 30-37 ..C and pH 6.0-8.0. The major fatty acids were ai-C15:0 (34.7...%), i-C15:0 (11.6...%) and ai-C17:0 (14.9...%); the predominant respiratory quinone was MK-9(H2), with MK-8(H2) present as a minor component. The polar lipid composition of strain CW 59T consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, two glycolipids and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (minor component). The whole-cell sugars contained galactose, mannose, ribose and glucose; the major amino acids of the cell-wall were lysine, alanine and glutamic acid. The genomic DNA G+C content was 66.9 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CW 59T belonged to the genus Sinomonas and grouped with members of the species Sinomonas atrocyanea, Sinomonas flava, Arthrobacter echigonensis and Arthrobac	2014	5	16	Int J Syst Evol Microbiol	International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology	Amino Acids; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Base Composition; Cell Wall; China; DNA, Bacterial; Fatty Acids; Micrococcaceae; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Phylogeny; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Trees; Vitamin K 2	Zhou	Yu
21549106	10.1016/j.cca.2011.04.023	Enzymatic assay of phosphatidylethanolamine in serum using amine oxidase from Arthrobacter sp.	In human serum, as for phospholipids not containing choline, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) exists approximately 5% in a whole phospholipid. PE is well known as one of the main components of biological membranes, and also plays important roles that contribute to apoptosis and cell signaling. However, it could not measure PE with other phospholipids due to a lack of choline in them. Using an amine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6), from Arthrobacter species, a simple and rapid enzymatic assay for measurements of PE in serum was established. That assay used the Hitachi 7170 analyzer to evaluate the analytical performance. The average within-run CVs were 0.38-1.27% (n=20) at 69-160 ..mol/l. The correlation between values obtained with the present method (y) and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method (x) was: y=0.944x+9.441 (r=0.977, S(y|x)=5.82, n=34).

A comparative investigation was performed on the effects of hydroxypropyl-..-cyclodextrin (HP-..-CD) on the growth, biocatalytic activity, and cell integrity of Arthrobacter simplex TCCC 11037 (ASP) and Mycobacterium sp. NRRL B-3683 (MSP). The addition of HP-..-CD to ASP medium improved its cell wall permeability for lipophilic compounds but significantly inhibited its growth and biocatalytic activity. On the other hand, the addition of HP-..-CD to MSP broth had lesser effects. Atomic force microscopy scanning analysis revealed that HP-..-CD damaged the cell integrity in ASP, especially the outermost cell surface structure, but not in MSP, which remained intact, owing to the differences in their cell wall and cell membrane composition. Protein leaking and lipid content in ASP increased with increased HP-..-CD concentration, indicating possible alterations in ASP cell membrane features caused by HP-..-CD.

21464592		Molecular characterization of cold-inducible beta-galactosidase from Arthrobacter sp. ON14 isolated from Antarctica.	A psychrotrophic bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. ON14, isolated from Antarctica, was shown to exhibit a high beta-galactosidase activity at a low temperature. A genomic library of ON14 was constructed and screened for beta-galactosidase genes on functional plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as the substrate. Two different beta-galactosidase genes, named as galA, galB, were found in ON14. Computational analyses of the genes revealed that the encoded protein GalA belongs to family 2 of glycosyl hydrolysases and is a cold-active protein, whereas GalB belongs to family 42 of glycosyl hydrolysases and is a mesophilic protein. Reverse transcription analyses revealed that the expression of galA is highly induced at a low temperature (4 degrees C) and repressed at a high temperature (28degreesC) when lactose is used as the sole carbon source. Conversely, the expression of galB is inhibited at a low temperature and induced at a high temperature.

21436548	10.2166/wst.2011.352	Novel bacterial strains for the removal of microcystins from drinking water.	Microcystins (MC) and nodularin (NOD) are common contaminants of drinking water around the world and due to their significant health impact it is important to explore suitable approaches for their removal. Unfortunately, these toxins are not always removed by conventional water treatments. One of the most exciting areas that hold promise for a successful and cost effective solution is bioremediation of microcystins. Recent work resulted in successful isolation and characterisation of 10 novel bacterial strains (Rhodococcus sp., Arthrobacter spp. and Brevibacterium sp.) capable of metabolizing microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in a Biolog MT2 assay. The work presented here aims to further investigate and evaluate the metabolism and the degradation of multiple microcystins (MC-LR, MC-LF, MC-LY, MC-LW and MC-RR) and nodularin by the bacterial isolates.

A comparative genomic analysis of three species of the soil bacterium Arthrobacter was undertaken with specific emphasis on genes involved in important and core energy metabolism pathways like glycolysis and amino acid metabolism. During the course of this study, it was revealed that codon bias of a particular species, namely Arthrobacter aurescens TC1, is significantly lower than that of the other two species A. chlorophenolicus A6 and Arthrobacter sp. FB24. The codon bias was also found to be negatively correlated with gene expression level which is determined by computing codon adaptation index of the genes. Uniformity in codon usage pattern among three species is evident in terms of genes which has high codon bias and multifunctional nature. Further, it was observed that this trend is present amongst the genes of important metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis and amino acid metabolism.

21416334	10.1007/s10532-011-9459-z	Simultaneous phenanthrene and cadmium removal from contaminated soil by a ligand/biosurfactant solution.	Surfactants and inorganic ligands are pointed as efficient to simultaneous removal of heavy metals and hydrophobic organic pollutants from soil. However, the biosurfactants are potentially less toxic to soil organisms than other chemical agents. Thus, in this study the efficiency of combinations of iodide (I(-)) ligand and surfactants produced by different bacterial species in the simultaneous removal of cadmium (Cd(2+)) and phenanthrene in a Haplustox soil sample was investigated. Four microbial surfactants and the synthetic surfactant Triton X-100 were tested with different concentrations of ligand. Soil samples contaminated with Cd(2+) and phenanthrene underwent consecutive washings with a surfactant/ligand solution. The removal of Cd(2+) increased with increased ligand concentration, particularly in solutions containing biosurfactants produced by the bacterial strains Bacillus subtilis LBBMA155 (lipopeptide) and Flavobacterium sp.

K-1 ..-fructofuranosidase (ArFFase), a glycoside hydrolase family 68 enzyme, catalyzes the hydrolysis and transfructosylation of sucrose. ArFFase is useful for producing a sweetener, lactosucrose (4(G)-..-D-galactosylsucrose). The primary structure of ArFFase is homologous to those of levansucrases, although ArFFase catalyzes mostly hydrolysis when incubated with sucrose alone, even at high concentration. Here, we determined the crystal structure of ArFFase in unliganded form and complexed with fructose. ArFFase consisted of a five-bladed ..-propeller fold as observed in levansucrases. The structure of ArFFase was most similar to that of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus levansucrase (GdLev). The structure of the catalytic cleft of ArFFase was also highly homologous to that of GdLev. However, two amino acid residues, Tyr232 and Pro442 in ArFFase, were not conserved between them.

23039946	10.1186/1471-2164-13-534	Complete genome sequence and metabolic potential of the quinaldine-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. Rue61a.	Bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter are ubiquitous in soil environments and can be considered as true survivalists. Arthrobacter sp. strain Rue61a is an isolate from sewage sludge able to utilize quinaldine (2-methylquinoline) as sole carbon and energy source. The genome provides insight into the molecular basis of the versatility and robustness of this environmental Arthrobacter strain. The genome of Arthrobacter sp. Rue61a consists of a single circular chromosome of 4,736,495...bp with an average G + C content of 62.32%, the circular 231,551-bp plasmid pARUE232, and the linear 112,992-bp plasmid pARUE113 that was already published. Plasmid pARUE232 is proposed to contribute to the resistance of Arthrobacter sp. Rue61a to arsenate and Pb2+, whereas the linear plasmid confers the ability to convert quinaldine to anthranilate.

23028517	10.1371/journal.pone.0044313	Characterization of a novel phenol hydroxylase in indoles biotransformation from a strain Arthrobacter sp. W1 [corrected].	Indigoids, as popular dyes, can be produced by microbial strains or enzymes catalysis. However, the new valuable products with their transformation mechanisms, especially inter-conversion among the intermediates and products have not been clearly identified yet. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate novel microbial catalytic processes for indigoids production systematically. A phenol hydroxylase gene cluster (4,606 bp) from Arthrobacter sp. W1 (PH(w1)) was obtained. This cluster contains six components in the order of KLMNOP, which exhibit relatively low sequence identities (37-72%) with known genes. It was suggested that indole and all the tested indole derivatives except for 3-methylindole were transformed to various substituted indigoid pigments, and the predominant color products derived from indoles were identified by spectrum analysis. One new purple product from indole, 2-(7-oxo-1H-indol-6(7H)-ylidene) indolin-3-one, should be proposed as the dimerization of isatin and 7-hyd	2013	3	6	PLoS One	PloS one	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Indoles; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Molecular Sequence Data; Substrate Specificity	Qu	Yuanyuan
22985203	10.1021/jf3021909	Enhanced mineralization of diuron using a cyclodextrin-based bioremediation technology.	The phenylurea herbicide diuron [N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N,N-dimethylurea] is widely used in a broad range of herbicide formulations and, consequently, it is frequently detected as a major soil and water contaminant in areas where there is extensive use. Diuron has the unfortunate combination of being strongly adsorbed by soil organic matter particles and, hence, slowly degraded in the environment due to its reduced bioavailability. N-Phenylurea herbicides seem to be biodegraded in soil, but it must be kept in mind that this biotic or abiotic degradation could lead to accumulation of very toxic derived compounds, such as 3,4-dichloroaniline. Research was conducted to find procedures that might result in an increase in the bioavailability of diuron in contaminated soils, through solubility enhancement. For this purpose a double system composed of hydroxypropyl-..-cyclodextrin (HPBCD), which is capable of forming inclusion complexes in solution, and a two-member bacterial consortium forme	2014	7	18	J Agric Food Chem	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	2-Hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin; Adsorption; Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Comamonadaceae; Cyclodextrins; Diuron; Herbicides; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Water Pollutants; beta-Cyclodextrins	Villaverde	Jaime
22981745	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.08.047	Metabolic ability and individual characteristics of an atrazine-degrading consortium DNC5.	A stable four-member bacterial consortium, DNC5 that was capable of metabolizing atrazine was isolated from corn-planted soil. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the individual metabolic characteristics and the mutualism of the cultivable members in the consortium DNC5. Substrates utilizing character of each community member indicate that the primary organism in this consortium is Arthrobacter sp. DNS10, which was the only strain capable of mineralizing atrazine to cyanuric acid. Two secondary strains (Bacillus subtilis DNS4 and Variovorax sp. DNS12) utilized cyanuric acid during the atrazine degradation process. Meanwhile, we found that a metabolite (isopropylamine) inhibited the atrazine degrading species Arthrobacter sp. DNS10. The last strain (Arthrobacter sp. DNS9) of this consortium played a role in reducing this inhibition by utilizing isopropylamine for its growth. Altogether this is a new combination of isolates in an atrazine degrading consortium.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of exogenous nitrogen on a microbial community inoculated with the atrazine-degrading Arthrobacter sp. in soil amended with a high concentration of atrazine. Inoculated and uninoculated microcosms for biodegradation tests were constructed. Atrazine degradation capacity of the strain DAT1 and the strain's atrazine-metabolic potential and survival were assessed. The relative abundance of the strain DAT1 and the bacterial community structure in soils were characterized using quantitative PCR in combination with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Atrazine degradation by the strain DAT1 and the strain's atrazine-metabolic potential and survival were not affected by addition of a medium level of nitrate, but these processes were inhibited by addition of a high level of nitrate. Microbial community structure changed in both inoculated and uninoculated microcosms, dependent on the level of added nitrate.

22950448	10.1186/1471-2180-12-193	Characterization of copper-resistant bacteria and bacterial communities from copper-polluted agricultural soils of central Chile.	Copper mining has led to Cu pollution in agricultural soils. In this report, the effects of Cu pollution on bacterial communities of agricultural soils from Valparaiso region, central Chile, were studied. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of the 16S rRNA genes was used for the characterization of bacterial communities from Cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. Cu-resistant bacterial strains were isolated from Cu-polluted soils and characterized. DGGE showed a similar high number of bands and banding pattern of the bacterial communities from Cu-polluted and non-polluted soils. The presence of copA genes encoding the multi-copper oxidase that confers Cu-resistance in bacteria was detected by PCR in metagenomic DNA from the three Cu-polluted soils, but not in the non-polluted soil. The number of Cu-tolerant heterotrophic cultivable bacteria was significantly higher in Cu-polluted soils than in the non-polluted soil.

D-Tagatose is a natural monosaccharide which can be used as a low-calorie sugar substitute in food, beverages and pharmaceutical products. It is also currently being tested as an anti-diabetic and obesity control drug. D-Tagatose is a rare sugar, but it can be manufactured by the chemical or enzymatic isomerization of D-galactose obtained by a ..-D-galactosidase-catalyzed hydrolysis of milk sugar lactose and the separation of D-glucose and D-galactose. L-Arabinose isomerases catalyze in vitro the conversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose and are the most promising enzymes for the large-scale production of D-tagatose. In this study, the araA gene from psychrotolerant Antarctic bacterium Arthrobacter sp. 22c was isolated, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The active form of recombinant Arthrobacter sp. 22c L-arabinose isomerase consists of six subunits with a combined molecular weight of approximately 335 kDa.

22873756	10.1021/bi301059m	The catalytic mechanism of the hotdog-fold enzyme superfamily 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain SU.	The hotdog-fold enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoyl-coenzyme A (4-HB-CoA) thioesterase from Arthrobacter sp. strain AU catalyzes the hydrolysis of 4-HB-CoA to form 4-hydroxybenzoate (4-HB) and coenzyme A (CoA) in the final step of the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenation pathway. Guided by the published X-ray structures of the liganded enzyme (Thoden, J. B., Zhuang, Z., Dunaway-Mariano, D., and Holden H. M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 43709-43716), a series of site-directed mutants were prepared for testing the roles of active site residues in substrate binding and catalysis. The mutant thioesterases were subjected to X-ray structure determination to confirm retention of the native fold, and in some cases, to reveal changes in the active site configuration. In parallel, the wild-type and mutant thioesterases were subjected to transient and steady-state kinetic analysis, and to (18)O-solvent labeling experiments.

Phenol hydroxylase gene engineered microorganism (PHIND) was used to synthesize catechols from benzene and toluene by successive hydroxylation reaction. HPLC-MS and (1)H NMR analysis proved that the products of biotransformation were the corresponding catechols via the intermediate production of phenols. It was indicated that the main products of toluene oxidation were o-cresol and p-cresol. 3-Methylcatechol was the predominant product for m-cresol biotransformation. Formation rate of catechol (25 ..M/min/g cell dry weight) was 1.43-fold higher than that of methylcatechols.

22822530		Synergistic effect of calcium stearate and photo treatment on the rate of biodegradation of low density polyethylene spent saline vials.	The biodegradation of spent saline bottles, a low density polyethylene product (LDPE) by two selected Arthrobacter sp. under in vitro conditions is reported. Chemical and UV pretreatment play a vital role in enhancing the rate of biodegradation. Treated LDPE film exhibits a higher weight loss and density when compared to untreated films. Arthrobacter oxydans and Arthrobacter globiformis grew better in medium containing pretreated film than in medium containing untreated film. The decrease in density and weight loss of LDPE was also more for pretreated film when compared to untreated film indicating the affect of abiotic treatment on mechanical properties of LDPE. The decrease in the absorbance corresponding to carbonyl groups and double bonds that were generated during pretreatment suggest that some of the double bonds were cut by Arthrobacter species.

The feasibility of using an indigenous microbial consortium for the removal of crude oil from an oil-spilled coastal area was explored with the ultimate aim of applying for bioremediation. Initially, we obtained the microbial consortium TK-2 that catalyzed the dispersion as well as the degradation of crude oil in supplemented sea water. GC and GC-MS were used to evaluate the removal patterns of crude oil during the incubation. The effective removal of crude oil by TK-2 occurred, and above 95% of all aliphatic and aromatic compounds detected in this work was removed within 30 days of incubation. Two predominant crude oil-grown isolates derived from TK-2 revealed gram-negative, rod-shaped cells. Both BIOLOG system and 16S rRNA sequencing were conducted to identify the strains, which were assigned to Arthrobacter sp. HK-2 and Pseudoalteromonas sp.

22427495	10.1128/AEM.00006-12	Key enzymes enabling the growth of Arthrobacter sp. strain JBH1 with nitroglycerin as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.	Flavoprotein reductases that catalyze the transformation of nitroglycerin (NG) to dinitro- or mononitroglycerols enable bacteria containing such enzymes to use NG as the nitrogen source. The inability to use the resulting mononitroglycerols limits most strains to incomplete denitration of NG. Recently, Arthrobacter strain JBH1 was isolated for the ability to grow on NG as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, but the enzymes and mechanisms involved were not established. Here, the enzymes that enable the Arthrobacter strain to incorporate NG into a productive pathway were identified. Enzyme assays indicated that the transformation of nitroglycerin to mononitroglycerol is NADPH dependent and that the subsequent transformation of mononitroglycerol is ATP dependent. Cloning and heterologous expression revealed that a flavoprotein catalyzes selective denitration of NG to 1-mononitroglycerol (1-MNG) and that 1-MNG is transformed to 1-nitro-3-phosphoglycerol by a glycerol kinase homolog.

The pathways used by microorganisms for the metabolism of every xenobiotic substrate are specific. The catabolism of a xenobiotic goes through a series of intermediate steps and lower intermediates (metabolites) appear in sequence. The structure of the metabolites can be similar to the parents due to kinship. The purposes of this study were to examine if the degradation pathways that were developed for a parent xenobiotic are effective to degrade the parent's lower metabolites, and if the reverse is true. The xenobiotic substrates, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D, the parent xenobiotic) and its metabolite 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), were independently subjected to acclimation and degradation tests by the biomasses of mixed-culture activated sludge and a pure culture of Arthrobacter sp.

The strain showed 67% reduction of 2mM chromate in 7 days and was associated with the formation of green insoluble precipitate, which showed characteristic peak of chromium in to energy dispersive X-ray analysis. However, Fourier transform infrared spectra have failed to detect any complexation of end products of Cr(VI) reduction with the cell mass. Reduction of chromate increased with increased cell density and was maximum at 10(10)cells/ml, but the reduction potential decreased with increase in Cr(VI) concentration. Chromate reducing efficiency was promoted when glycerol and glucose was used as electron donors.

22339012	10.2166/wst.2012.692	Optimization of a bacterial consortium for nitrobenzene degradation.	Three bacterial strains, Arthrobacter sp. NB1, Serratia sp. NB2 and Stenotrophomonas sp. NB3, were isolated from contaminated sludge by using nitrobenzene as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. It was observed that all three strains could degrade nitrobenzene at 400 mg/L initial concentration and mixed-cultivation of these strains could enhance the degradation of nitrobenzene compared with mono-cultivation. Mixture design was used for adjusting the proportions of each strain and the optimal ratio of inoculation size was NB1:NB2:NB3 = 4:4:5, where the nitrobenzene degradation percentage was two times higher than for by the single strain. The results of Plackett-Burman design indicated that Mg(2+), Ca(2+), Fe(2+), Zn(2+) and Mn(2+) had a positive effect on the degradation of nitrobenzene, while Cu(2+) and Co(2+) had a negative effect on it.	2012	4	16	Water Sci Technol	Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	Analysis of Variance; Arthrobacter; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Models, Biological; Nitrobenzenes; Regression Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Serratia; Stenotrophomonas	Jin	D F
22327597	10.1128/AEM.06586-11	Key residues for controlling enantioselectivity of Halohydrin dehalogenase from Arthrobacter sp. strain AD2, revealed by structure-guided directed evolution.	Halohydrin dehalogenase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1 (HheC) is a valuable tool in the preparation of R enantiomers of epoxides and ..-substituted alcohols. In contrast, the halohydrin dehalogenase from Arthrobacter sp. AD2 (HheA) shows a low S enantioselectivity toward most aromatic substrates. Here, three amino acids (V136, L141, and N178) located in the two neighboring active-site loops of HheA were proposed to be the key residues for controlling enantioselectivity. They were subjected to saturation mutagenesis aimed at evolving an S-selective enzyme. This led to the selection of two outstanding mutants (the V136Y/L141G and N178A mutants). The double mutant displayed an inverted enantioselectivity (from S enantioselectivity [E(S)] = 1.7 to R enantioselectivity [E(R)] = 13) toward 2-chloro-1-phenylethanol without compromising enzyme activity. Strikingly, the N178A mutant showed a large enantioselectivity improvement (E(S) &gt; 200) and a 5- to 6-fold-enhanced specific activity t	2012	7	9	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Amino Acid Substitution; Arthrobacter; Catalytic Domain; Directed Molecular Evolution; Hydrolases; Models, Molecular; Mutant Proteins; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Substrate Specificity	Tang	Lixia

A bioflocculant-producing bacteria was isolated from Tyume River in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa and identified by 16S rRNA gene nucleotide sequence to have 91% similarity to Arthrobacter sp. 5J12A, and the nucleotide sequence was deposited in GenBank as Arthrobacter sp. Raats (accession number HQ875723). The bacteria produced an extracellular bioflocculant when grown aerobically in a production medium containing glucose as sole carbon source and had an initial pH of 7.0. Influences of carbon, nitrogen and metal ions sources, as well as initial pH on flocculating activity were investigated. The bacteria optimally produced the bioflocullant when lactose and urea were used as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen respectively with flocculating activities of 75.4% and 83.4% respectively. Also, the bacteria produced the bioflocculant optimally when initial pH of the medium was 7.0 (flocculating activity 84%), and when Mg(2+) was used as cation (flocculating activity 77%).

22267672	10.1128/AEM.07025-11	Functional identification of two novel genes from Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 involved in the catabolism of nicotine.	Nicotine is a natural alkaloid produced by tobacco plants, and the mechanisms of its catabolism by microorganisms are diverse. In the present study, we reported the mutation, cloning, and identification of two novel genes involved in nicotine degradation from the newly isolated Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6. Transposon mutagenesis identified a HZN6 mutant in which the nicotine-degrading pathway was blocked at pseudooxynicotine. A 3,874-bp DNA fragment flanking the transposon insertion site was obtained through self-formed adaptor PCR. Two open reading frames (designated pao and sap) were analyzed, and the deduced amino acid sequences shared 29% identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans and 49% identity with an aldehyde dehydrogenase from Bartonella henselae. Both pao and sap were cloned and functionally expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli BL21.

An actinobacterial strain, designated D48(T), was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of a cypress tree collected from Mianyang in Sichuan province, China. The strain was Gram-stain-positive, catalase-positive, oxidase-negative and non-motile, with lysine as the peptidoglycan diagnostic diamino acid and acetyl as the peptidoglycan acyl type. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9(H(2)); small amounts of MK-7(H(2)), MK-10(H(2)) and MK-6 were also present. The major fatty acids were anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and iso-C(16:0). The isolate underwent a rod-coccus morphological cycle, had a high DNA G+C content, was aerobic and grew between 12 and 37 ..C (optimum, 28 ..C). On the basis of the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses, 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and DNA-DNA hybridization data, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Arthrobacter, for which the name Arthrobacter cupressi sp. nov. is proposed.

In this study we investigated the role of arsenic-resistant bacteria Arthrobacter sp. biomass for removal of arsenite as well as arsenate from aqueous solution. The biomass sorption characteristics were studied as a function of biomass dose, contact time and pH. Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) models were applied to describe the biosorption isotherm. The Langmuir model fitted the equilibrium data better than the Freundlich isotherm. The biosorption capacity of the biomass for As(+3) and As(+5) was found to be 74.91 mg/g (pH 7.0) and 81.63 mg/g (pH 3.0), respectively using 1 g/L biomass with a contact time of 30 min at 28 degrees C. The mean sorption energy values calculated from the D-R model indicated that the biosorption of As(+3) and As(+5) onto Arthrobacter sp. biomass took place by chemical ion-exchange. The thermodynamic parameters showed that the biosorption of As(+3) and As(+5) ions onto Arthrobacter sp. biomass was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic in na	2014	3	11	Environ Technol	Environmental technology	Adsorption; Arsenates; Arsenites; Arthrobacter; Biomass; Thermodynamics; Water Pollutants, Chemical	Prasad	Kumar Suranjit

Himalayas are considered as a reservoir of diversified and dynamic gene pool. This study describes the response of a Himalayan psychrophilic diazotroph to low temperature diazotrophy. Seven cold adaptive N2 fixing bacteria were isolated and identified as Bacillus sp., Arthrobacter sp., Rhodococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., etc. In order to examine the physiological response to low temperature diazotrophy, differential proteomic analysis of Pseudomonas migulae S10724 strain was carried out using two dimensional electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS. Functional assessment of 66 differentially expressed proteins revealed several mechanisms thought to be involved in low temperature adaptation and nitrogen fixation, including general stress adaptation, protein and nucleic acid synthesis, energy metabolism, cell growth/maintenance, etc. Major fraction of the upregulated proteins was stress proteins, while majority of the downregulated proteins were related to cell division.

Nanostructured titania (nano-TiO2) is an engineered nanomaterial that can be cytotoxic primarily as a result of its ability to generate reactive oxygen species when illuminated. Production of nano-TiO2 has increased rapidly over the last decade, leading to concerns about its release into aquatic environments. To address the possible ecological impacts of nano-TiO2, the authors used high-throughput screening to assess the responses of 4 bacteria representative of genera common in freshwater to short-term exposure (1-2...h) in 2 natural aqueous media (stream water and lake water) to 2 widely used TiO2 products, pigment white 6 (PW6) and P25. Under simulated solar illumination PW6 and P25 reduced the abundance of viable Bacillus subtilis and Aeromonas hydrophila, confirming the cytotoxicity of nano-TiO2 .

Plant-microbe joint interactions degraded 98.10..% of the atrazine, while single strain and single plant only degraded 87.38 and 66.71..% after a 30-day experimental period, respectively. The results indicated that plant-microbe joint interactions had a better degradation effect. Meanwhile, we found that plant-microbe joint interactions showed a higher microbial diversity. The results of microbial diversity illustrated that the positive effects of cropping could improve soil microbial growth and activity.

In this study, we investigated the microbial community (bacteria and fungi) colonising an oil painting on canvas, which showed visible signs of biodeterioration. A combined strategy, comprising culture-dependent and -independent techniques, was selected. The results derived from the two techniques were disparate. Most of the isolated bacterial strains belonged to related species of the phylum Firmicutes, as Bacillus sp. and Paenisporosarcina sp., whereas the majority of the non-cultivable members of the bacterial community were shown to be related to species of the phylum Proteobacteria, as Stenotrophomonas sp. Fungal communities also showed discrepancies: the isolated fungal strains belonged to different genera of the order Eurotiales, as Penicillium and Eurotium, and the non-cultivable belonged to species of the order Pleosporales and Saccharomycetales.

Monooxygenation is an important route of nitroaromatic compound (NAC) biodegradation and it is widely found for cometabolic transformations of NACs and other aromatic pollutants. We investigated the C and N isotope fractionation of nitrophenol monooxygenation to complement the characterization of NAC (bio)degradation pathways by compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA). Because of the large diversity of enzymes catalyzing monooxygenations, we studied the combined C and N isotope fractionation and the corresponding (13)C- and (15)N-apparent kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs) of four nitrophenol-biodegrading microorganisms (Bacillus spharericus JS905, Pseudomonas sp. 1A, Arthrobacter sp.

Swainsonine (SW) is a toxin produced by locoweeds and harmful to the livestock industry. Degrading SW by Arthrobacter sp. HW08 was demonstrated as a promising way to deal with SW poisoning. However, it is unknown which part of the subcellular enzymes in Arthrobacter sp. HW08 is responsible for biodegrading SW and whether the metabolites are atoxic. In this study, intracellular and extracellular enzymes of Arthrobacter sp. HW08 were isolated and their enzyme activity was evaluated. The metabolites were fed to mice, and physiological and histological properties of the treated mice were investigated. The results showed that only intracellular enzyme of Arthrobacter sp. HW08 (IEHW08) could degrade SW efficiently. Compared with mice in SW treatment group, mice in SW + IEHW08 treatment group (1) increased their body weights; (2) showed higher number of platelets and lower number of white blood cells; (3) decreased the levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen, alanine transaminase and aspartate am	2014	6	19	Toxins (Basel)	Toxins	Alanine Transaminase; Animals; Arthrobacter; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Biodegradation, Environmental; Blood Platelets; Body Weight; Cerebellum; Creatinine; Female; Kidney; Leukocytes; Liver; Male; Mice; Nitrogen; Swainsonine	Wang	Yan

The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen sources on simazine biodegradation by Arthrobacter sp. strain SD1 and the community structures of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in non-agricultural soil. Soil microcosms with different treatments were constructed for herbicide biodegradation test. The relative abundance of the strain SD1 and the structures of AOA and AOB communities were assessed using quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), respectively. The co-existence of two inorganic nitrogen sources (ammonia and nitrate) had certain impact on simazine dissipation by the strain SD1. Bioaugmentation could induce a shift in the community structures of both AOA and AOB, but AOA were more responsive.

The current study aimed to characterize Arthrobacter sp. Sphe3 ability to reduce Cr(VI) in suspended cell cultures as well as in immobilized form using Ca-alginate beads. Adaptation studies in the presence of 5 mg L(-1) Cr(VI) showed a significant increase in specific growth rate from 0.25 to 0.3 h(-1) and bioremoval percentage from 64% to 94% (p&lt;0.05), whereas Arthrobacter sp.

High glucose concentrations helped at reducing (80..2.4)% of initial 100 mg L(-1) Cr(VI), whereas the bacterial strain could tolerate 850 mg L(-1) Cr(VI). Cr(III) formation was first evidenced by the appearance of a green insoluble precipitate in the medium.

The widespread use of Methyl tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) as a gasoline additive has resulted in a higher detection rate of MTBE in groundwater systems. Therefore, the researchers show more concern about the bioremediation of MTBE-impacted aquifers. In this paper, a MTBE-direct-degrading bacterial consortium was enriched (named RS1) and further studied. In order to identify the microbial community of the consortium, 17 and 12 different single strains were isolated from nutrient medium and MSM media (with MTBE as the sole carbon source), respectively. 16S rDNA-based phylogenetic analysis revealed that these diverse bacteria belonged to 14 genera, in which Pseudomonas was dominant. Several strains which can grow with MTBE as the sole carbon and energy source were also identified, such as M1, related to MTBE-degrading Arthrobacter sp. ATCC27778.

The inulin fructotransferase (DFA III-forming)(EC 4.2.2.18) gene in Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 was amplified from genomic DNA, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The 1326-bp gene, designated as Nsp-ift, encodes a protein composed of a putative 37-amino-acid signal peptide and 404-amino-acid mature protein. A putative ribosomal binding sequence was identified 12 bases upstream from the start codon. However, a typical bacterial promoter could not be found by in silico analysis. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the enzyme was most similar to that of inulin fructotransferase (DFA I-forming) in Frankia sp. EAN1pec. Phylogenetic analysis of deduced amino-acid sequences indicated that Nonomuraea sp. ID06-A0189 and Frankia sp. EAN1pec inulin fructotransferases formed a distinct clade from those from Arthrobacter sp. H65-7, A. globiformis and Bacillus sp. snu-7 that showed 57, 56 and 56% identity to that of Nsp-ift, respectively.

Arthrobacter sp. CGMCC 3584 are able to produce cAMP from glucose by the purine synthesis pathway via de novo or salvage biosynthesis. In order to gain an improved understanding of its metabolism, (13)C-labeling experiment and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis were employed to determine the metabolic network structure and estimate the intracellular fluxes. GC-MS analysis helps to reflect the activity of the intracellular pathways and reactions. The metabolic network mainly contains glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the inactive glyoxylate shunt. Hypoxanthine as a precursor of cAMP and sodium fluoride as an inhibitor of glycolysis were found to increase the cAMP production, as well as the flux through the PP pathway. The effects of adding hypoxanthine and sodium fluoride are discussed based on the enzyme assays and metabolic flux analysis.

24052365	10.1007/s10482-013-0027-x	High ultraviolet C resistance of marine Planctomycetes.	Planctomycetes are bacteria with particular characteristics such as internal membrane systems encompassing intracellular compartments, proteinaceous cell walls, cell division by yeast-like budding and large genomes. These bacteria inhabit a wide range of habitats, including marine ecosystems, in which ultra-violet radiation has a potential harmful impact in living organisms. To evaluate the effect of ultra-violet C on the genome of several marine strains of Planctomycetes, we developed an easy and fast DNA diffusion assay in which the cell wall was degraded with papain, the wall-free cells were embedded in an agarose microgel and lysed. The presence of double strand breaks and unwinding by single strand breaks allow DNA diffusion, which is visible as a halo upon DNA staining. The number of cells presenting DNA diffusion correlated with the dose of ultra-violet C or hydrogen peroxide. From DNA damage and viability experiments, we found evidence indicating that some strains of Planctomyc	2014	5	26	Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek	Antonie van Leeuwenhoek	Bacteria; DNA Damage; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Ultraviolet Rays	Viana	Fl..via

CW9 isolated from guts of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) was used to improve the survival rate, growth rate and immune status of white shrimp (P. vannamei). Arthrobacter sp. CW9 was added to the saline rearing water at 0, 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) CFU ml(-1) once every 5 days during the 24-day breeding experiment. The probiotic group had significantly higher survival rates, mean shrimp weights, phenoloxidase activity, phagocytic activity and clearance efficiency compared with the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Therefore, Arthrobacter sp. CW9 has both probiotic and immunostimulatory properties. This study demonstrates that Arthrobacter sp. CW9 has both probiotic and immunostimulatory properties. Such new strain therefore represents an alternative to the use of white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) culture. New bacterial having both probiotic and immunostimulatory properties are the major novelty of this study.

After the endo-inulinase gene from Arthrobacter sp. was ligated the expression vectors pMIDSC31 and pMIRSC31, the endo-inulinase gene was inserted into the chromosomal DNA of Saccharomyces sp. W0. It was found that the inulinase activity of the recombinant yeast D5 in which the endo-inulinase gene was inserted into the delta sequence was higher than that of the recombinant yeast R1 in which the endo-inulinase gene was inserted into 18S rDNA sequence. More ethanol from inulin was produced by the recombinant yeast D5 than by the recombinant yeast R1. But Saccharomyces sp. W0 produced the lowest inulinase activity and concentration of ethanol. During the 3-l fermentation, the recombinant yeast D5 could produce 13.6 ml of ethanol per 100ml of the fermented medium from 30% inulin.

23973535	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.095	Fungal-bacterial consortia increase diuron degradation in water-unsaturated systems.	Bioremediation of pesticide-polluted soil may be more efficient using mixed fungal-bacterial cultures rather than the individual strains alone. This may be due to cooperative catabolism, where the first organism transforms the pollutant to products which are then used by the second organism. In addition, fungal hyphae may function as transport vectors for bacteria, thereby facilitating a more effective spreading of degrader organisms in the soil. A more rapid mineralization of the phenylurea herbicide diuron was found in sand with added microbial consortia consisting of both degrading bacteria and fungi. Facilitated transport of bacteria by fungal hyphae was demonstrated using a system where herbicide-spiked sand was separated from the consortium by a layer of sterile glass beads. Several fungal-bacterial consortia were investigated by combining different diuron-degrading bacteria (Sphingomonas sp. SRS2, Variovorax sp.

D-Mandelate dehydrogenases (D-ManDHs), belonging to a new d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase family, catalyze the conversion between benzoylformate and d-mandelate using NAD as a coenzyme. We determined the first D-ManDH structure, that of ManDH2 from Enterococcus faecalis IAM10071. The overall structure showed ManDH2 has a similar fold to 2-ketopantoate reductase (KPR), which catalyzes the conversion of 2-ketopantoate to d-pantoate using NADP as a coenzyme. They share conserved catalytic residues, indicating ManDH2 has the same reaction mechanism as KPR. However, ManDH2 exhibits significant structural variations in the coenzyme and substrate binding sites compared to KPR. These structural observations could explain their different coenzyme and substrate specificities.	2013	11	12	Biochem Biophys Res Commun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	2-Ketopantoate reductase; 2-ketopantoate reductase; 2-ketopantoate reductase from Escherichia coli; CENDH; Coenzyme specificity; Crystal structure; EcKPR; KPR; ManDH2; N-(1-d-carboxyethyl)-l-norvaline dehydrogenase from Arthrobacter sp.; Substrate specificity; d-2-HydDH; d-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase; d-ManDH; d-Mandelate dehydrogenase; d-mandelate dehydrogenase; d-mandelate dehydrogenase from Enterococcus faecalis IAM10071; rmsd; root mean square deviation.; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Coenzymes; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Protein Binding; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity	Miyanaga	Akimasa

Unlike their terrestrial counterparts, marine myxobacteria are hardly investigated for their secondary metabolites. This study describes three new compounds (1-3), named salimyxins and enhygrolides, obtained from the obligate marine myxobacterium Enhygromyxa salina. These are the first natural products obtained from Enhygromyxa species. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, including NMR and CD spectroscopy. Enhygrolides are closely related to the nostoclides, which were initially isolated from a cyanobacterium of the genus Nostoc. The salimyxins, representing structurally most unusual degraded sterols, are close to identical to demethylincisterol from the sponge Homaxinella sp.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of exogenous urea nitrogen on ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and other soil bacterial communities in soil bioaugmented for simazine remediation. The previously isolated simazine-degrading Arthrobacter sp. strain SD1 was used to degrade the herbicide. The effect of urea on the simazine degradation capacity of the soil bioaugmented with Arthrobacter strain SD1 was assessed using quantitative PCR targeting the s-triazine-degrading trzN and atzC genes. Structures of bacterial and AOB communities were characterized using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Urea fertilizer could affect simazine biodegradation and decreased the proportion of its trzN and atzC genes in soil augmented with Arthrobacter strain SD1.

Organoclays are effective sorbents for removal of organic contaminants from water, but their regeneration capacity limits their practical use as a biotechnological process for bioremediation. Here, the sorption of p-nitrophenol (PNP) to crystal violet (CV)-modified montmorillonite and its biodegradation by the bacterium Arthrobacter sp. 4H.. were studied in a batch aqueous system. The degree of PNP sorption was dependent on the degree of CV modification (loaded at 80 % or 100 % of the clay's cation-exchange capacity-CVM80 and CVM100, respectively). CV sorption to the clay reduced its toxicity to bacteria. PNP at an initial concentration of 0.72 mM was degraded at rates of 65 % and 42 % in CVM80 and CVM100 suspensions, respectively. Both free and CV-clay-adsorbed PNP concentrations were reduced by the bacteria at rates proportional to the degree of CV modification.

Nitroglycerin (NG) is a toxic explosive found as a contaminant of soil and groundwater. Several microbial strains are capable of partially reducing the NG molecule to dinitro or mononitroesters. Recently, a strain capable of growing on NG as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen (Arthrobacter sp. strain JBH1) was isolated from contaminated soil. Despite the widespread presence of microbial strains capable of transforming NG in contaminated soils and sediments, the extent of NG biodegradation at contaminated sites is still unknown. In this study column experiments were conducted to investigate the extent of microbial degradation of NG in saturated porous media, specifically after bioaugmentation with JBH1. Initial experiments using sterile, low sorptivity sand, showed mineralization of NG after bioaugmentation with JBH1 in the absence of sources of carbon and nitrogen other than NG.

Recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing phenol hydroxylase (designated as strain PH(IND)) were used to synthesize chloro-substituted indigoids by the transformation of indoles. The optimal conditions for the biotransformation of 4- and 7-chloroindole were determined by response surface methodology. Biotransformation kinetic assays revealed that strain PH(IND) showed high catalytic efficiency for 4- and 7-chloroindole. The formation rate of 7,7'-dichloroindigo (1.35 unit/mg cell dry weight) by strain PH(IND) was 1.14-fold higher than that of 4,4'-dichloroindigo. The intermediates of 7-chloroindole biotransformation were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy, and the biotransformation mechanism was also proposed. These results suggested that there was a potential application of strain PH(IND) in the biotransformation of chloro-substituted indoles to valuable indigoids.	2013	11	25	Appl Biochem Biotechnol	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Culture Media; Escherichia coli; Glucose; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Indoles; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Oxidation-Reduction; Species Specificity	Shi	Shengnan

Two different media, a minimal medium supplemented with a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and a MS medium supplemented with triphenyltetrazolium chloride, were used for the isolation of bacterial strains from two hydrocarbon contaminated soils and from their enrichment phases. The hydrocarbon degradation abilities of these bacterial isolates were easily and rapidly assessed using the 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol assay. The diversity of the bacterial communities isolated from these two soil samples and from their enrichment phases was evaluated by the combination of a bacterial clustering method, fluorescence ITS-PCR, and bacterial identification by 16S rRNA sequencing.

23360325	10.1111/jam.12152	Identification and functional analysis of fructosyl amino acid-binding protein from Gram-positive bacterium Arthrobacter sp.	Fructosyl amino acid-binding protein (FABP) is a substrate-binding protein (SBP), which recognizes fructosyl amino acids (FAs) as its ligands. Although FABP has been shown as a molecular recognition tool of biosensing for glycated proteins, the availability of FABP is still limited and no FABP was reported from Gram-positive bacteria. In this study, a novel FABP from Gram-positive bacteria, Arthrobacter spp., was reported. BLAST analysis revealed that FABP homologues exist in some of Arthrobacter species genomes. An FABP homologue cloned from Arthrobacter sp. FV1-1, FvcA, contained a putative lipoprotein signal sequence, suggesting that it is a lipoprotein anchored to the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, which is a typical characteristic for SBPs from Gram-positive bacteria. In contrast, FvcA also exhibits high amino acid sequence similarity to a known Gram-negative bacterial FABP, which exists as a free periplasmic protein. FvcA, without the N-terminal anchoring region, was then recomb	2014	2	13	J Appl Microbiol	Journal of applied microbiology	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Fatty Acids; Fructosamine; Ligands; Lipoproteins; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Sorting Signals; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Substrate Specificity	Sakaguchi-Mikami	A
23335761	10.1128/AEM.03824-12	Cloning of a novel nicotine oxidase gene from Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 whose product nonenantioselectively degrades nicotine to pseudooxynicotine.	Pseudomonas sp. strain HZN6 utilizes nicotine as its sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. However, its catabolic mechanism has not been elucidated. In this study, self-formed adaptor PCR was performed to amplify the upstream sequence of the pseudooxynicotine amine oxidase gene. A 1,437-bp open reading frame (designated nox) was found to encode a nicotine oxidase (NOX) that shows 30% amino acid sequence identity with 6-hydroxy-l-nicotine oxidase from Arthrobacter nicotinovorans. The nox gene was cloned into a broad-host-range cloning vector and transferred into the non-nicotine-degrading bacteria Escherichia coli DH5.. (DH-nox) and Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (KT-nox). The transconjugant KT-nox obtained nicotine degradation ability and yielded an equimolar amount of pseudooxynicotine, while DH-nox did not. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that the nox gene is expressed in both DH5.. and KT2440, suggesting that additional factors required for nicotine degradation are present in a P	2013	8	28	Appl Environ Microbiol	Applied and environmental microbiology	Amino Acid Sequence; Arthrobacter; Biotransformation; Butanones; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Bacterial; Escherichia coli; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Profiling; Genetic Vectors; Molecular Sequence Data; Nicotine; Oxidoreductases; Pseudomonas; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid	Qiu	Jiguo

25427856	10.1186/s12934-014-0164-6	Metabolic pathway for degradation of 2-chloro-4-aminophenol by Arthrobacter sp. SPG.	A degradation pathway of 2-chloro-4-aminophenol (2C4AP) was studied in an Arthrobacter sp. SPG that utilized 2C4AP as its sole source of carbon and energy. The 2C4AP degradation was initiated by a 2C4AP-deaminase that catalyzed the conversion of 2C4AP into chlorohydroquinone (CHQ) with removal of ammonium ion. In the next step, a CHQ-dehalogenase dehalogenated CHQ to hydroquinone (HQ) that cleaved into ..-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde by a HQ-dioxygenase. The 2C4AP degradation was also investigated in sterile and non-sterile soil microcosms using strain SPG. The results show that the SPG cells degraded 2C4AP more rapidly in sterile soil than non-sterile soil. Our studies showed that strain SPG may be used for bioremediation of 2C4AP-contaminated sites. This is the first report of the 2C4AP degradation by any bacteria.	2015	10	6	Microb Cell Fact	Microbial cell factories	Aminohydrolases; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chlorophenols	Arora	Pankaj Kumar

Hydrocarbons and fatty acid methyl esters were identified by chromatography-mass spectrometry in the extracts from the native biomass of bacteria: chemoorganoheterotrophic Arthrobacter sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and chemolithoautotrophic Carboxydothermus sp. Ultrasound treatment of bacterial biomass and mild thermolysis were shown promote formation of a broad spectrum of hydrocarbons from bacterial biomass. The biomarker stigmastane belonging to the sterane group was found in P. aeruginosa biomass after thermolysis at 110 degrees C in an open vial. Alkane composition in P. aeruginosa biomass before and after thermolysis at 300 degrees C in a sealed container remained unchanged, indicating the possibility of preservation of hydrocarbons of bacterial origin in sealed layers under high temperature and elevated pressure.	2015	1	13	Mikrobiologiia	Mikrobiologiia	Arthrobacter; Biomass; Esters; Fatty Acids; Heating; Hydrocarbons; Mass Spectrometry; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Thermoanaerobacterium; Ultrasonics	Botvinko	I V

This is the first report on a complete genome sequence and biological characterization of the phage that infects Arthrobacter. A novel virus vB_ArS-ArV2 (ArV2) was isolated from soil using Arthrobacter sp. 68b strain for phage propagation. Based on transmission electron microscopy, ArV2 belongs to the family Siphoviridae and has an isometric head (...63 nm in diameter) with a non-contractile flexible tail (...194..10 nm) and six short tail fibers. ArV2 possesses a linear, double-stranded DNA genome (37,372 bp) with a G+C content of 62.73%. The genome contains 68 ORFs yet encodes no tRNA genes. A total of 28 ArV2 ORFs have no known functions and lack any reliable database matches. Proteomic analysis led to the experimental identification of 14 virion proteins, including 9 that were predicted by bioinformatics approaches. Comparative phylogenetic analysis, based on the amino acid sequence alignment of conserved proteins, set ArV2 apart from other siphoviruses.

25256888	10.1111/gbi.12102	A mineralogical characterization of biogenic calcium carbonates precipitated by heterotrophic bacteria isolated from cryophilic polar regions.	Precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3(s) ) can be driven by microbial activity. Here, a systematic approach is used to identify the morphological and mineralogical characteristics of CaCO3(s) precipitated during the heterotrophic growth of micro-organisms isolated from polar environments. Focus was placed on establishing mineralogical features that are common in bioliths formed during heterotrophic activity, while in parallel identifying features that are specific to bioliths precipitated by certain microbial phylotypes. Twenty microbial isolates that precipitated macroscopic CaCO3(s) when grown on B4 media supplemented with calcium acetate or calcium citrate were identified. A multimethod approach, including scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and micro-X-ray diffraction (..-XRD), was used to characterize CaCO3(s) precipitates.

25149321	10.1016/j.biortech.2014.07.112	Characterization and flocculation mechanism of an alkali-activated polysaccharide flocculant from Arthrobacter sp. B4.	The characterization and flocculation mechanism of a bioflocculant produced by Arthrobacter sp. B4 were investigated. The bioflocculant's active ingredient was a polysaccharide (B4-PS) that consisted of three main fractions corresponding to the molecular weights of approximately 3.97..10(4)Da, 6.84..10(3)Da and 5.9..10(6)Da, respectively. These fractions were composed of galactose, glucose, mannose and glucuronic acid. Flocculation experiments showed that B4-PS could spontaneously flocculate in the presence of Ca(2+) ions at a high pH (&gt;12.0), followed by the pH reduction to ...6.0. The self-flocculation of B4-PS may be mediated by ionization and charge neutralization mechanism. Furthermore, B4-PS exhibited excellent capabilities for pollutant removal and pH reduction in alkaline wastewater. These data suggest B4-PS may be a promising tool for use in industrial alkaline wastewater pretreatment. 	2015	6	2	Bioresour Technol	Bioresource technology	Arthrobacter sp.

24888562	10.1002/bab.1253	Xylanolytic enzyme systems in Arthrobacter sp. MTCC 5214 and Lactobacillus sp.	The production of extracellular xylanolytic enzymes such as xylanase, ..-l-arabinofuranosidase (..-l-AFase), and acetyl xylan esterase (Axe) by marine Arthrobacter sp. and Lactobacillus sp. was investigated using different carbon sources. Induction and repression of all these enzymes differed with carbon source and also with the organism. Wheat bran was the best carbon source for the production of xylanase and ..-l-AFase, whereas both isolates showed maximum Axe production when grown on oat bran as a carbon source. Preferential utilization of a carbon source for enzyme production can give us better insights into regulatory mechanism in these marine bacteria.

24863363	10.1007/s00792-014-0649-6	Halophilic bacteria are colonizing the exhibition areas of the Capuchin Catacombs in Palermo, Italy.	The Capuchin Catacombs of Palermo, Italy, contain over 1800 mummies dating from the 16th to 20th centuries AD. Their environment is not conducive to the conservation of the remains due to, among other factors, water infiltration, which is producing salt efflorescences on the walls. A multiphasic approach was applied to investigate the halophilic microbiota present in the Catacombs. Enrichment cultures were conducted on media containing different NaCl concentrations, ranging from 3 to 20 %. For screening of the strains, the following two PCR-based methods were used and compared: fluorescence internal transcribed spacer PCR (f-ITS) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. Results derived from RAPD profiles were shown to be slightly more discriminative than those derived from f-ITS. In addition, the proteolytic and cellulolytic abilities were screened through the use of plate assays, gelatin agar and Ostazin Brilliant Red H-3B (OBR-HEC), respectively.

A naphthalene-utilizing bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. W1, was used to investigate the cometabolic degradation of carbazole (CA), dibenzofuran (DBF) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) using naphthalene as the primary substrate. Both the growing and washed cells of strain W1 could degrade CA, DBF, DBT, and naphthalene simultaneously and quickly. Inhibition kinetics confirmed that the presence of CA, DBF and DBT in the growing system would inhibit the cells growth and biodegradability of strain W1. The relationship between ln(C/C0) and time, and specific degradation rate and CA, DBF and DBT concentration could be described well by First-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The treatment of real coking wastewater containing high concentration of phenol, naphthalene, CA, DBF, DBT and NH3-N was shown to be highly efficient by naphthalene-grown W1 coupling with activation zeolite.

Using decarboxylation medium and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, histamine-producing bacteria (HPB) in blue scad (Decapterus maruadsi) were isolated and identified, and the histamine-producing abilities of the isolated HPB were determined. Nine mesophilic strains (H1-H9) isolated from the muscle of blue scad were identified as the genera of HPB, including Arthrobacter bergeri (H1), Pseudomonas sp. (H2, H5 and H6), Psychrobacter sp. (H3), Shewanella baltica (H4 and H7), and Aeromonas salmonicida (H8 and H9), respectively. Results showed that most of the HPB strains were weak on histamine formation (13.0-20.4 mg/l), except for the H8 strain with the ability of producing 115 mg of histamine/l in trypticase soy broth containing 1.0 % L-histidine. As the strongest HPB in blue scad, bacterial strain H8 also presented a strong ability to produce other biogenic amines, such as putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine, tyramine and tryptamine.

A ..-fructofuranosidase from Microbacterium saccharophilum K-1 (formerly known as Arthrobacter sp. K-1) is useful for producing the sweetener lactosucrose (4(G)-..-D-galactosylsucrose). Thermostability of the ..-fructofuranosidase was enhanced by random mutagenesis and saturation mutagenesis. Clones with enhanced thermostability included mutations at residues Thr47, Ser200, Phe447, Phe470, and Pro500. In the highest stability mutant, T47S/S200T/F447P/F470Y/P500S, the half-life at 60 ..C was 182 min, 16.5-fold longer than the wild-type enzyme. A comparison of the crystal structures of the full-length wild-type enzyme and three mutants showed that various mechanisms appear to be involved in thermostability enhancement. In particular, the replacement of Phe447 with Val or Pro induced a conformational change in an adjacent residue His477, which results in the formation of a new hydrogen bond in the enzyme.

A bacterial strain C21 isolated from constructed wetland soil was identified as Arthrobacter sp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and physio-biochemical characteristics and was capable of utilizing di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) as a carbon and energy source for growth. Strain C21 can also utilize other phthalates (PAEs) up to a molecular weight of 390.56 and phthalic acid (PA). The biodegradability of these compounds decreased with the increase in the length of phthalate alkyl chains and molecular weight. Kinetic analysis indicated that the strain C21 cell growth on DBP fitted well with Haldane-Andrews' model (R (2)...&gt;...0.98) with .. max, K s, and K i of 0.12/h, 4.2 mg/L, and 204.6 mg/L, respectively. When the initial DBP concentration was lower than 100 mg/L, DBP biodegradation reaction fitted with the first-order kinetics. The results suggested that Arthrobacter strain C21 played an active role in the bioremediation of the wetland contaminated with phthalates.	2014	12	5	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Biotransformation; Carbon; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Energy Metabolism; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Molecular Sequence Data; Phthalic Acids; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; Wetlands	Wen	Zhi-Dan

BT and BTA have been found in the municipal and industrial wastewater, rivers, soil, groundwater, sediments and sludge. The origins of those substances' presence in the environment are various industry branches (food, chemical, metallurgical, electrical), households and surface runoff from industrial areas. Increasingly strict regulations on water quality and the fact that the discussed compounds are poorly biodegradable, make them a serious problem in the environment. Considering this, it is important to look for environmentally friendly and socially acceptable ways to remove BT and BTA. The aim of this study was to identify microorganisms capable of BT and BTA transformation or/and degradation in aquatic environment. Selected microorganisms were isolated from activated sludge.

Previously, a di-D-fructofuranose 1,2':2,3' dianhydride (DFA III)-producing strain, Arthrobacter aurescens SK8.001, was isolated from soil, and the gene cloning and characterization of the DFA III-forming enzyme was studied. In this study, a DFA III hydrolysis enzyme (DFA IIIase)-encoding gene was obtained from the same strain, and the DFA IIIase gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The SDS-PAGE and gel filtration results indicated that the purified enzyme was a homotrimer holoenzyme of 145 kDa composed of subunits of 49 kDa.

Vermiculite is one of matrix material used for constructed wetland (CW) for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Arthrobacter sp. strain C21 (CGMCC No. 7671), isolated from a constructed wetland receiving municipal wastewater, forms biofilm on the surface of vermiculite. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a typical phthalate pollutant in environment, can be degraded by the biofilm of strain C21 formed on vermiculite. Results of laboratory studies indicated that DEHP was removed from aqueous phase via biodegradation, adsorption by vermiculite, and adsorption by biofilm biomass. Synergistic effect of these three reactions enhanced the overall DEHP removal efficiency. During a batch incubation test with vermiculite and the cell suspension, bacterial adhesion to the media surface occurred within 5h and the phthalate esters (PEs) removal was due to both biodegradation and vermiculite adsorption.

Arthrobacter sp. strain YC-RL1, capable of utilizing bisphenol A (BPA) as sole carbon source for growth, was isolated from petroleum contaminated soil. YC-RL1 could rapidly degrade BPA in a wide range of pH (5.0-9.0) and temperature (20-40 ..C). Substrate analysis found that YC-RL1 could also degrade bisphenol F (BPF) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). The maximum and minimum concentrations of BPA (0.2-600 mg/L), BPF (0.2-600 mg/L), and TBBPA (0.2-300 mg/L) for efficient biodegradation were detected. The released bromide ion and metabolic intermediates of BPF and BPA/TBBPA were detected, as well as the degradation pathways for BPF and BPA/TBBPA were deduced tentatively. The present study provides important information for the investigation of BPs degrading mechanism and the application of microbial remediation in BP-contaminated environment.

The regioselectivity of the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase-catalyzed oxidation is governed mostly by electronic effects leading to the migration of the higher substituted residue. However, in some cases, substrate binding occurs in a way that the less substituted residue lies in an antiperiplanar orientation to the peroxy bond in the Criegee intermediate yielding in the formation of the "abnormal" lactone product. We are the first to demonstrate a complete switch in the regioselectivity of the BVMO from Arthrobacter sp. (CHMOArthro) as exemplified for (+)-trans-dihydrocarvone by redesigning the active site of the enzyme. In the designed triple mutant, the substrate binds in an inverted orientation leading to a ratio of 99:1 in favor of the normal lactone instead of exclusive formation of the abnormal lactone in case of the wild type enzyme. In order to validate our computational study, the beneficial mutations were successfully transferred to the CHMO from Acinetobacter sp.

The research was aimed at determining the abundance and viability of biofilm formed on the surface of polylactide (PLA) during its biodegradation in different environments. It was also aimed at isolating biofilm forming bacteria, determining their hydrolytic activity and taxonomic status. The first step was to evaluate PLA biodegradability in lake water, compost and soil, using OxiTop Control. The next step was to assess the ability of isolated bacteria to form biofilm in the investigated environments and to evaluate the biofilm structure. The results indicate that PLA is sensitive to biodegradation in any environment, particularly in compost. During this process biofilm of high viability was observed on the surface of PLA.

The Arthrobacter sp. strain AK-YN10 is an s-triazine pesticide degrading bacterium isolated from a sugarcane field in Central India with history of repeated atrazine use. AK-YN10 was shown to degrade 99 % of atrazine in 30 h from media supplemented with 1000 mg L(-1) of the herbicide. Draft genome sequencing revealed similarity to pAO1, TC1, and TC2 catabolic plasmids of the Arthrobacter taxon. Plasmid profiling analyses revealed the presence of four catabolic plasmids. The trzN, atzB, and atzC atrazine-degrading genes were located on a plasmid of approximately 113 kb.The flagellar operon found in the AK-YN10 draft genome suggests motility, an interesting trait for a bioremediation agent, and was homologous to that of Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus. The multiple s-triazines degradation property of this isolate makes it a good candidate for bioremediation of soils contaminated by s-triazine pesticides.	2016	10	31	Appl Microbiol Biotechnol	Applied microbiology and biotechnology	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Bioremediation; Draft genome; Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Base Sequence; Biodegradation, Environmental; Genome, Bacterial; Herbicides; India; Plasmids; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Saccharum; Soil Microbiology	Sagarkar	Sneha
26336239	10.1093/jme/tjv099	Bacteria Present in Comadia redtenbacheri Larvae (Lepidoptera: Cossidae).	The external and internal culturable bacterial community present in the larvae of Comadia redtenbacheri Hammerschmidt, an edible insect, was studied. Characterization of the isolates determined the existence of 18 morphotypes and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene revealed the existence of Paenibacillus sp., Bacillus safensis, Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus pseudomycoides, Corynebacterium variabile, Enterococcus sp., Gordonia sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Arthrobacter sp., Micrococcus sp., and Bacillus cereus. Greater diversity of bacteria was found in those larvae obtained from vendors than in those directly taken from Agave plants in nature. Many of the larvae obtained from vendors presented signs of potential disease, and after the analysis, results showed a greater bacterial community compared with the larvae with a healthy appearance. This indicates that bacterial flora can vary in accordance with how the larvae are handled during extraction, collection, and transport. 	2015	12	17	J Med Entomol	Journal of medical entomology	agave; appearance; bacterial community; collection procedure; entomophagy; Animals; Bacteria; DNA, Bacterial; Larva; Microbiota; Molecular Sequence Data; Moths; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA	Hern..ndez-Flores	L

To investigate the application potential of the p-nitrophenol-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. CN2 in practice, the effects of pH, salinity and additional carbon source were determined, and the degradation kinetics of p-nitrophenol was analyzed. Strain CN2 could degrade p-nitrophenol efficiently in a wide range of pH (7.0-8.0) and elevated salinity (0-60 g .. L(-1)). Investigation of additional glucose found that 0.5% of glucose could significantly increase the degrading speed and the time to reach 90% of degradation rate was shortened by 16 hours. These results indicated that strain CN2 could degrade p-nitrophenol efficiently under different conditions and had a great potential for application in practice.	2015	9	8	Huan Jing Ke Xue	Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue	Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Kinetics; Nitrophenols; Salinity	Ren	Lei

Strain JS443 Catalyzes the Initial Two Sequential Monooxygenations.	p-Nitrophenol (PNP), used primarily for manufacturing pesticides and dyes, has been recognized as a priority environmental pollutant. It is therefore important to reduce the input of this toxicant into the environment and to establish approaches for its removal from the contaminated sites. PNP monooxygenase, a novel enzyme from Gram-positive bacteria like Arthrobacter sp. and Bacillus sp., that comprises two components, a flavoprotein reductase and an oxygenase, catalyzes the initial two sequential monooxygenations to convert PNP to trihydroxybenzene. Accurate and reliable prediction of this enzyme-substrate interactions and binding affinity are of vital importance in understanding these catalytic mechanisms of the two sequential reactions. As crystal structure of the enzyme has not yet been published, we built a homology model for PNP monooxygenase using crystallized chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 (3HWC) as the template.

The mucosal surfaces of wild and farmed aquatic vertebrates face the threat of many aquatic pathogens, including fungi. These surfaces are colonized by diverse symbiotic bacterial communities that may contribute to fight infection. Whereas the gut microbiome of teleosts has been extensively studied using pyrosequencing, this tool has rarely been employed to study the compositions of the bacterial communities present on other teleost mucosal surfaces. Here we provide a topographical map of the mucosal microbiome of an aquatic vertebrate, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Using 16S rRNA pyrosequencing, we revealed novel bacterial diversity at each of the five body sites sampled and showed that body site is a strong predictor of community composition. The skin exhibited the highest diversity, followed by the olfactory organ, gills, and gut. Flectobacillus was highly represented within skin and gill communities.

B4 (B4-EPS) exhibited an excellent chromium (VI) (Cr(VI)) removal capability without any pH adjustment, whereby 50mgL(-1) of Cr(VI) could be completely removed by 4gL(-1) of B4-EPS. The kinetics tests revealed that the first-order rate constant was 8.3..10(-5)s(-1) and the optimal reaction time was 720min. However, a low initial concentration of Cr(VI) (5-30mgL(-1)) would accelerate the reaction rate of Cr(VI) removal and shorten reaction time to less than 360min. Meanwhile, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra indicated that Cr(VI) was reduced to Cr(III) by B4-EPS in accordance with the emergence of the green reaction products. Furthermore, the Fourier transform-infrared spectra (FT-IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of B4-EPS contributed to Cr(VI) reduction.

26142994	10.1016/j.biortech.2015.06.106	Characterization of a novel cometabolic degradation carbazole pathway by a phenol-cultivated Arthrobacter sp. W1.	Arthrobacter sp. W1 was used to characterize the pathways involved in cometabolic degradation of carbazole (CA) with phenol as the primary substrate. To clarify the upper pathway of cometabolic degradation CA, Escherichia coli strain BL21 expressing phenol hydroxylase from strain W1 (PHIND) was investigated to degrade CA. Firstly, CA was initially monohydroxylated at C-2 and C-4 positions to produce 2- and 4-hydroxycarbazole, followed by successively hydroxylated to the corresponding 1,2- and 3,4-dihydroxycarbazole, of which 3,4-dihydroxycarbazole was unequivocally identified for the first time. To characterize the downstream cometabolic degradation CA pathway, purified 3,4-dihydroxycarbazole was used as the substrate for phenol-grown W1, and a series of novel indole derivatives were identified. These results suggested that a novel pathway of CA catabolism was employed by strain W1 via a successive hydroxylation and meta-cleavage pathway.

SPG utilized 2-nitrobenzoate as its sole source of carbon and energy and degraded it with accumulation of stoichiometric amounts of nitrite ions. Salicylate and catechol were detected as metabolites of the 2-nitrobenzoate degradation using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enzyme activities for 2-nitrobenzoate-2-monooxygenase, salicylate hydroxylase, and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase were detected in the crude extracts of the 2-nitrobenzoate-induced cells of strain SPG. The 2-nitrobenzoate-monooxygenase activity resulted in formation of salicylate and nitrite from 2-nitrobenzoate, whereas salicylate hydroxylase catalyzed the conversion of salicylate to catechol. The ring-cleaving enzyme, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase cleaved catechol to cis,cis-muconic acid.

25938576	10.3791/52781	An optimized enrichment technique for the isolation of Arthrobacter bacteriophage species from soil sample isolates.	Bacteriophage isolation from environmental samples has been performed for decades using principles set forth by pioneers in microbiology. The isolation of phages infecting Arthrobacter hosts has been limited, perhaps due to the low success rate of many previous isolation techniques, resulting in an underrepresented group of Arthrobacter phages available for study. The enrichment technique described here, unlike many others, uses a filtered extract free of contaminating bacteria as the base for indicator bacteria growth, Arthrobacter sp. KY3901, specifically. By first removing soil bacteria the target phages are not hindered by competition with native soil bacteria present in initial soil samples. This enrichment method has resulted in dozens of unique phages from several different soil types and even produced different types of phages from the same enriched soil sample isolate. The use of this procedure can be expanded to most nutrient rich aerobic media for the isolation of phages in 	2016	9	19	J Vis Exp	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE	Arthrobacter; Bacteriophages; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Virology	Cross	Trevor

Nicotine-degrading microorganisms (NDMs) are a special microbial group which can use nicotine as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth. Since the 1950s, the bioconversion of nicotine by microbes has received increasing attention, and several NDMs have been identified, such as Arthrobacter nicotinovorans, Microsporum gypseum, Pellicularia filamentosa JTS-208, and Pseudomonas sp. 41. In recent years, increasing numbers of NDMs have been isolated and identified from tobacco plantation soil, leaf, and tobacco waste. Meanwhile, the metabolic pathway and degradation mechanism of nicotine have been elucidated in several NDMs, such as A. nicotinovorans, Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33, Aspergillus oryzae, and Pseudomonas putida S16. Moreover, several NDMs have been used in improving the quality of cigarettes, treating tobacco waste, and producing valuable intermediates of nicotine.

Difructose dianhydride III (DFA III) is a functional carbohydrate produced from inulin by inulin fructotransferase (IFTase, EC 4.2.2.18). In this work, an IFTase gene from Arthrobacter sp. 161MFSha2.1 was cloned and expressed in Escherachia coli. The recombinant enzyme was purified by metal affinity chromatography. It showed significant inulin hydrolysis activity, and the produced main product from inulin was determined as DFA III by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The molecular mass of the purified protein was calculated to be 43 and 125 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, respectively, suggesting the native enzyme might be a homotrimer.

25782532	10.3109/07388551.2015.1015958	Utilization of microbial community potential for removal of chlorpyrifos: a review.	Chlorpyrifos (CP) is the most commonly used pesticide in agricultural fields worldwide. Exposure to CP and its metabolites creates severe neuron-disorders in human beings. Improper handling and uncontrolled application of CP by farmers have lead to the contamination of surface and ground water bodies. Biodegradation offers an efficient and cost effective method for the removal of CP and other toxic organophosphorus pesticides from the contaminated environment. The degradation of CP by various microorganisms has been investigated by several researchers over the past few years. This review presents a critical summary of the recent published results on the biodegradation of CP. A diverse range of bacterial species such as Agrobacterium sp., Alcaligenes faecalis, Enterobacter sp. Arthrobacter sp.

The present investigation was aimed to scrutinize the salt tolerance potential of plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) isolated from rhizospheric soil of selected halophytes (Atriplex leucoclada, Haloxylon salicornicum, Lespedeza bicolor, Suaeda fruticosa, and Salicornica virginica) collected from high-saline fields (electrical conductivity 4.3-5.5) of District Mardan, Pakistan. Five PGPR strains were identified using 16S rRNA amplification and sequence analysis. Bacillus sp., isolated from rhizospheric soil of Atriplex leucoclada, and Arthrobacter pascens, isolated from rhizospheric soil of Suaeda fruticosa, are active phosphate solubilizers and bacteriocin and siderophore producers; hence, their inoculation and co-inoculation on maize ('Rakaposhi') under induced salinity stress enhanced shoot and root length and shoot and root fresh and dry mass.

Melamine belongs to the s-triazine family, and industrially used as raw product in many ways all over the world. Melamine has been reported for human harmful effects and detected from some crops, soil and water. To remove melamine from the polluted environment, the efficient melamine-mineralizing microorganisms have been needed. We newly isolated three melamine-degrading bacteria from the same upland soil sample using soil-charcoal perfusion method. These bacteria were classified as Arthrobacter sp. MCO, Arthrobacter sp. CSP and Microbacterium sp. ZEL by 16S rRNA genes sequencing analysis. Both Arthrobacter species completely degraded melamine within 2 days, and consumed melamine as a sole nitrogen source. Both strains also grew in cyanuric acid as sole nitrogen source, and released small quantities of ammonium ions. These strains are the first identified bacteria that can mineralize both melamine and cyanuric acid as sole initial nitrogen source in Arthrobacter sp.

Heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be efficient bioremediators of metals and may provide an alternative or additional method to conventional methods of metal removal. In this study, 10 bacterial isolates were isolated from soil samples of a sugar industry, located at Peshawar, Pakistan. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of these isolates were observed.

A glycoside hydrolase family 32 exo-inulinase gene was cloned from Arthrobacter sp. HJ7 isolated from saline soil located in Heijing town. The gene encodes an 892-residue polypeptide with a calculated mass of 95.1..kDa and a high total frequency of amino acid residues G, A, and V (30.0%). Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells were used as hosts to express the exo-inulinase gene. The recombinant exo-inulinase (rInuAHJ7) showed an apparently maximal activity at pH 5.0-5.5 and 40-45..C. The addition of 1.0 and 10.0..mM Zn(2+) and Pb(2+) had little or no effect on the enzyme activity. rInuAHJ7 exhibited good salt tolerance, retaining more than 98% inulinase activity at a concentration of 3.0%-20.0% (w/v) NaCl. Fructose was the main product of inulin, levan, and Jerusalem artichoke tubers hydrolyzed by the enzyme.

25680000	10.1021/es504673j	Gene expression of an arthrobacter in surfactant-enhanced biodegradation of a hydrophobic organic compound.	Surfactants can affect the biodegradation process and the fate of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) in the environment. Previous studies have shown that surfactants can enhance the biodegradation of HOCs by increasing cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and membrane fluidity. In this study, we took this work one step further by investigating the expression levels of three genes of Arthrobacter sp.

It is therefore important to reduce the input of this toxicant into the environment and to establish approaches for its removal from the contaminated sites. PNP monooxygenase, a novel enzyme from Gram-positive bacteria like Arthrobacter sp. and Bacillus sp., that comprises two components, a flavoprotein reductase and an oxygenase, catalyzes the initial two sequential monooxygenations to convert PNP to trihydroxybenzene. Accurate and reliable prediction of this enzyme-substrate interactions and binding affinity are of vital importance in understanding these catalytic mechanisms of the two sequential reactions. As crystal structure of the enzyme has not yet been published, we built a homology model for PNP monooxygenase using crystallized chlorophenol 4-monooxygenase from Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 (3HWC) as the template.

Bacterial and archaeal cell envelopes are complex multilayered barriers that serve to protect these microorganisms from their extremely harsh and often hostile environments. Import of exogenous proteins and nanoparticles into cells is important for biotechnological applications in prokaryotes. In this report, we demonstrate that cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), both bacteria-expressed nona-arginine peptide (R9) and synthetic R9 (SR9), are able to deliver noncovalently associated proteins or quantum dots into four representative species of prokaryotes: cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp.

However, little is known regarding the effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the biodegradation and persistence of organic contaminants in water. We investigated the impacts of pristine and oxidized multiwalled CNTs on the atrazine biodegradation rate and efficiency using Arthrobacter sp. At a concentration of 25mg/L, the CNTs enhanced the biodegradation rate by up to 20%; however, at a concentration of 100mg/L, the CNTs decreased the biodegradation rate by up to 50%. The stimulation effects resulted from enhanced bacterial growth and the overexpression of degradation genes. The inhibitory effects resulted from the toxicity of the CNTs at high concentrations. The differences between the two CNTs at tested concentrations were not significant. The biodegradation efficiency was not impacted by adsorption, and the pre-adsorbed atrazine on the CNTs was fully biodegraded when the CNT concentration was ...25mg/L.

We previously presented the cloning, heterologous expression, and characterization of a novel multidomain endoxylanase from Arthrobacter sp. GN16 isolated from the feces of Grus nigricollis. Molecular and biochemical characterization studies indicate that the glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 domain at the N-terminus of the multidomain xylanase (rXynAGN16L) is a low-temperature-active endoxylanase. Many low-temperature-active enzymes contain regions of high local flexibility related to their kinetic and thermodynamic properties compared with mesophilic and thermophilic enzymes. However, the thermodynamic property of low-temperature-active xylanases, including rXynAGN16L, has rarely been reported. In this study, the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of rXynAGN16L were determined using different substrates and temperature conditions to completely characterize its activity properties. The kinetic property of rXynAGN16L is similar to some low-temperature-active GH 10 endoxylanases.

25581392	10.1039/c4cp04419c	Unraveling the degradation of artificial amide bonds in nylon oligomer hydrolase: from induced-fit to acylation processes.	To elucidate how the nylon oligomer hydrolase (NylB) acquires its peculiar degradation activity towards non-biological amide bonds, we inspected the underlying enzymatic processes going from the induced-fit upon substrate binding to acylation. Specifically we investigated the mutational effects of two mutants, Y170F and D181G, indicated in former experiments as crucial systems because of their specific amino acid residues. Therefore, by adopting first-principles molecular dynamics complemented with metadynamics we provide a detailed insight into the underlying acylation mechanism. Our results show that while in the wild type (WT) the Tyr170 residue points the NH group towards the proton-acceptor site of an artificial amide bond, hence ready to react, in the Y170F this does not occur. The reason is ascribed to the absence of Tyr170 in the mutant, which is replaced by phenylalanine, which is unable to form hydrogen bond with the amide bond; thus, resulting in an increase in the activatio	2016	1	1	Phys Chem Chem Phys	Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP	Acylation; Amidohydrolases; Hydrolysis; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutation; Nylons; Protein Conformation; Quantum Theory; Thermodynamics	Baba	Takeshi

Elevated cadmium (Cd) concentrations in fishery byproducts are an environmental concern, that might be reduced by enzymatic removal and adsorption of the contaminants during recycling the byproducts as animal food. We cloned the gene for Arthrobacter nicotinovorans serine protease (ANISEP), which was isolated from the hepatopancreas of the Japanese scallop (Patiopecten yessoensis) and has been found to be an effective enzyme for Cd(II) removal. The gene is 993 bp in length and encodes 330 amino acids, including the pre (1-30) and pro (31-111) sequences. The catalytic triad consists of His, Asp, and Ser. Sequence similarities indicate that ANISEP is a extracellular serine protease. X-ray crystallography revealed structural similarities between ANISEP and the trypsin-like serine protease NAALP from Nesterenkonia sp. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Ser171 as catalytic residue. The keratinolytic activity of ANISEP was 10-fold greater than that of trypsin.

This encoding involves information transmission to offspring or to other organisms by horizontal transfer. However, despite the abundance of this molecule in both the cell and the environment, its physiological role seems to be restricted mainly to that of a coding and inheritance molecule. In this paper, we report a new physiological role for the DNA molecule as involved in protection against desiccation, in addition to its well-established main information transfer and other recently reported functions such as bio-film formation in eDNA form.

28011373	10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.12.020	Bioremediation of diuron contaminated soils by a novel degrading microbial consortium.	Diuron is a biologically active pollutant present in soil, water and sediments. It is persistent in soil, water and groundwater and slightly toxic to mammals and birds as well as moderately toxic to aquatic invertebrates. Its principal product of biodegradation, 3,4-dichloroaniline, exhibits a higher toxicity than diuron and is also persistent in the environment. On this basis, the objective of the study was to determine the potential capacity of a proposed novel diuron-degrading microbial consortium (DMC) for achieving not only diuron degradation, but its mineralisation both in solution as well as in soils with different properties. The consortium was tested in a soil solution where diuron was the only carbon source, and more than 98.8% of the diuron initially added was mineralised after only a few days.

Although acrylamide finds diverse industrial applications, its presence in the environment is hazardous due to its carcinogenic, neurotoxic, and teratogenic properties. In spite of the general toxicity of acrylamide in the monomer form, some microorganisms are able to use it as a source of energy by catabolizing it to ammonia and acrylic acid by means of acrylamidase (EC 3.5.1.4). The present work reports on a novel soil isolate as an acrylamide-degrading bacteria. Based on biochemical characterization and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence, the bacterial strain was identified as Gram-positive Arthrobacter sp. DBV1. The optimum growth conditions were found to be temperature (30....C) and pH 6.0 to 7.0.

27704380	10.1007/s11356-016-7682-1	Novel insights into the metabolic pathway of iprodione by soil bacteria.	Microbial degradation constitutes the key soil dissipation process for iprodione. We recently isolated a consortium, composed of an Arthrobacter sp. strain C1 and an Achromobacter sp. strain C2, that was able to convert iprodione to 3,5-dichloroaniline (3,5-DCA). However, the formation of metabolic intermediates and the role of the strains on iprodione metabolism remain unknown. We examined the degradation of iprodione and its suspected metabolic intermediates, 3,5-dichlorophenyl-carboxamide (metabolite I) and 3,5-dichlorophenylurea-acetate (metabolite II), by strains C1 and C2 and their combination under selective (MSM) and nutrient-rich conditions (LB). Bacterial growth during degradation of the tested compounds was determined by qPCR. Strain C1 rapidly degraded iprodione (DT50..=..2.3..h) and metabolite II (DT50..=..2.9..h) in MSM suggesting utilization of isopropylamine, transiently formed by hydrolysis of iprodione, and glycine liberated during hydrolysis of 	2017	3	23	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Environmental science and pollution research international	Achromobacter sp.; Arthrobacter sp.; Iprodione; Pesticides microbial degradation; Vinclozolin; Aminoimidazole Carboxamide; Aniline Compounds; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Fungicides, Industrial; Hydantoins; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Oxazoles; Propanil; Soil Microbiology	Campos	Marco

Indole is an interspecies and interkingdom signaling molecule widespread in different environmental compartment. Although multifaceted roles of indole in different biological systems have been established, little information is available on the microbial utilization of indole in the context of combating odor emissions from different types of waste. The present study was aimed at identifying novel bacteria capable of utilizing indole as the sole carbon and energy source. From the selective enrichment of swine waste and cattle feces, we identified Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the genera Arthrobacter and Alcaligenes. Bacteria belonging to the genus Alcaligenes showed higher rates of indole utilization than Arthrobacter. Indole at 1.0..mM for growth was completely utilized by Alcaligenes sp. in 16..h.

Bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) feed on the xylem and phloem of their host, which are composed of structural carbohydrates and organic compounds that are not easily degraded by the insects. Some of these compounds might be hydrolyzed by digestive enzymes produced by microbes present in the gut of these insects. In this study, we evaluated the enzymatic capacity of bacteria (Acinetobacter lwoffii, Arthrobacter sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas azotoformans, and Rahnella sp.) and yeasts (Candida piceae, Candida oregonensis, Cyberlindnera americana, Zygoascus sp., and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa) isolated from the Dendroctonus rhizophagus gut to hydrolyze cellulose, xylan, pectin, starch, lipids, and esters. All isolates, with the exception of C. piceae, showed lipolytic activity. Furthermore, P. putida, P. azotoformans, C. americana, C. piceae, and R. mucilaginosa presented amylolytic activity.

27518809	10.1038/ismej.2016.106	Microbe-microbe interactions trigger Mn(II)-oxidizing gene expression.	Manganese (Mn) is an important metal in geochemical cycles. Some microorganisms can oxidize Mn(II) to Mn oxides, which can, in turn, affect the global cycles of other elements by strong sorption and oxidation effects. Microbe-microbe interactions have important roles in a number of biological processes. However, how microbial interactions affect Mn(II) oxidation still remains unknown. Here, we investigated the interactions between two bacteria (Arthrobacter sp. and Sphingopyxis sp.) in a co-culture, which exhibited Mn(II)-oxidizing activity, although neither were able to oxidize Mn(II) in isolation. We demonstrated that the Mn(II)-oxidizing activity in co-culture was most likely induced via contact-dependent interactions. The expressed Mn(II)-oxidizing protein in the co-culture was purified and identified as a bilirubin oxidase belonging to strain Arthrobacter. Full sequencing of the bilirubin oxidase-encoding gene (boxA) was performed.

Two aerobic sulfadiazine (SDZ) degrading bacterial strains, D2 and D4, affiliated with the genus Arthrobacter, were isolated from SDZ-enriched activated sludge. The degradation of SDZ by the two isolates followed first-order decay kinetics. The half-life time of complete SDZ degradation was 11.3 h for strain D2 and 46.4 h for strain D4. Degradation kinetic changed from nongrowth to growth-linked when glucose was introduced as the cosubstrate, and accelerated biodegradation rate was observed after the adaption period. Both isolates could degrade SDZ into 12 biodegradation products via 3 parallel pathways, of which 2-amino-4-hydroxypyrimidine was detected as the principal intermediate product toward the pyrimidine ring cleavage. Compared with five Arthrobacter strains reported previously, D2 and D4 were the only Arthrobacter strains which could degrade SDZ as the sole carbon source.

Inulin fructotransferase (IFTase) is an important enzyme that produces di-d-fructofuranose 1,2':2,3' dianhydride (DAF III), which is beneficial for human health. Present investigations mainly focus on screening and characterizing IFTase, including catalytic efficiency and thermostability, which are two important factors for enzymatic industrial applications. However, few reports aimed to improve these two characteristics based on the structure of IFTase. In this work, a structural model of IFTase (DFA III-producing) from Arthrobacter sp. 161MFSha2.1 was constructed through homology modeling. Analysis of this model reveals that two residues, Ser-309 and Ser-333, may play key roles in the structural stability. Therefore, the functions of the two residues were probed by site-directed mutagenesis combined with the Nano-DSC method and assays for residual activity. In contrast to other mutations, single mutation of serine 309 (or serine 333) to threonine did not decrease the enzymatic stabil	2017	4	17	J Agric Food Chem	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry	di-d-fructofuranose 1,2...:2,3... dianhydride (DFA III); homology modeling; inulin; inulin fructotransferase (IFTase); thermostability; Amino Acid Motifs; Arthrobacter; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Enzyme Stability; Hexosyltransferases; Hot Temperature; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Inulin; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation	Yu	Shuhuai

In the present work, Arthrobacter sp. 25, a lead-tolerant bacterium, was assayed to remove lead(II) from aqueous solution. The biosorption process was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) based on the Box-Behnken design. The relationships between dependent and independent variables were quantitatively determined by second-order polynomial equation and 3D response surface plots. The biosorption mechanism was explored by characterization of the biosorbent before and after biosorption using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of 9.6 mg/g was obtained at the initial lead ion concentration of 108.79 mg/l, pH value of 5.75, and biosorbent dosage of 9.9 g/l (fresh weight), which was close to the theoretically expected value of 9.88 mg/g.

However, how bacterial diversity and community change in different successional stages of BSCs is still unknown. We used 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA to investigate the bacterial composition and community, and the relationships between bacterial composition and environmental factors were also explored. In different successional stages of BSCs, the number of bacteria operational taxonomic units (OTUs) detected in each sample ranged from 2572 to 3157. Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes were dominant in BSCs, followed by Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. At the successional stages of BSCs, bacterial communities, OTU composition and their relative abundance notably differentiated, and Cyanobacteria, especially Microcoleus vaginatus, dominated algal crust and lichen crust, and we	2017	2	17	J Basic Microbiol	Journal of basic microbiology	Bacterial diversity; Biological soil crusts; Community; Gurbantunggut Desert; Successional process; Actinobacteria; Bacteroidetes; China; Cyanobacteria; Desert Climate; Lichens; Microbial Consortia; Proteobacteria; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology	Zhang	Bingchang

The nutritional quality of daphnids diet can influence their growth, reproduction and survival. In aquatic ecosystems, bacteria can contribute significantly to Daphnia diet by supporting, for instances, their high needs for phosphorus. The laboratory feeding of the model organisms Daphnia spp. is algal based, but should be improved to allow their better performance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of two planctomycetes, Gemmata obscuriglobus and Rhodopirellula rubra, from exponential and stationary growth phases as alternative or supplementary food source for Daphnia magna. The actinobacterium Arthrobacter sp. was used for comparison. The feeding with only bacteria showed the inefficacy of both planctomycetes and actinobacteria as the only food source. However, when used in supplement to Raphidocelis subcapitata, a decrease in the age of first reproduction, a significant increase in reproductive output, in somatic growth and in rate of population increase was found 	2018	9	24	Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek	Antonie van Leeuwenhoek	Arthrobacter; Daphnia magna; FAME; Gemmata obscuriglobus; Life history; Rhaphydocelis subcapitata; Rhodopirellula rubra; Sonication; Animals; Arthrobacter; Chlorophyta; Daphnia; Food; Planctomycetales	Marinho	M C

Arthrobacter sp. strain KI72 grows on a 6-aminohexanoate oligomer, which is a by-product of nylon-6 manufacturing, as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen. We cloned the two genes, nylD 1 and nylE 1 , responsible for 6-aminohexanoate metabolism on the basis of the draft genomic DNA sequence of strain KI72. We amplified the DNA fragments that encode these genes by polymerase chain reaction using a synthetic primer DNA homologous to the 4-aminobutyrate metabolic enzymes. We inserted the amplified DNA fragments into the expression vector pColdI in Escherichia coli, purified the His-tagged enzymes to homogeneity, and performed biochemical studies. We confirmed that 6-aminohexanoate aminotransferase (NylD1) catalyzes the reaction of 6-aminohexanoate to adipate semialdehyde using ..-ketoglutarate, pyruvate, and glyoxylate as amino acceptors, generating glutamate, alanine, and glycine, respectively.

Arthrobacter sp. named as JY5-1 isolated from contaminated soil of a coking plant can degrade 1-naphthol as the sole carbon source. Through identification of species, analysis of the optimal degradation condition and kinetic equation, the degradation characteristic of Arthrobacter sp. JY5-1 was obtained. Later, the acclimated strain was added into the bio-reactor to observe treatment performance of landfill leachate. The results showed that the optimal conditions for strain JY5-1 biodegradation in the study were pH 7.0 and 30<sup>o</sup>C. The bio-reactor operation experiment declared that Arthrobacter sp. JY5-1 had a strengthened effect on COD removal of landfill leachate. Moreover, the efficiency of COD removal could be high and stable when JY5-1 was accumulated as a biofilm together with active sludge.

In gene engineering, a continuous set of promoters with various strengths are of importance for fine-tuning gene expression in metabolic optimization and control analysis. Here, for the first time, we constructed a promoter trap system using green fluorescence protein (GFP) as a reporter, for screening and characterizing functional Arthrobacter promoters. Twenty-three Arthrobacter transformants of various GFP fluorescence strengths were isolated and characterized through the analysis of DNA sequences. Among the 23 putative promoters, 2 were selected for deletion analysis of promoter elements. As a result, the deletion of the upstream of the putative promoter P8 and P13 caused a 43.8% decrease and a 29.1% increase in the fluorescence signals, respectively.

Hot spring water may harbour emerging waterborne opportunistic pathogens that can cause infections in humans. We have investigated the diversity and antimicrobial resistance of culturable emerging and opportunistic bacterial pathogens, in water and sediment of hot springs located in Limpopo, South Africa. Aerobic bacteria were cultured and identified using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene sequencing. The presence of Legionella spp. was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Isolates were tested for resistance to ten antibiotics representing six different classes: ..-lactam (carbenicillin), aminoglycosides (gentamycin, kanamycin, streptomycin), tetracycline, amphenicols (chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone), sulphonamides (co-trimoxazole) and quinolones (nalidixic acid, norfloxacin).

28905086	10.1007/s00253-017-8483-2	Identification and characterization of a novel (-)-vibo-quercitol 1-dehydrogenase from Burkholderia terrae suitable for production of (-)-vibo-quercitol from 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose.	(-)-vibo-Quercitol is a deoxyinositol (1L-1,2,4/3,5-cyclohexanepentol) that naturally occurs in oak species, honeydew honey, wines aged in oak barrels, and Gymnema sylvestre and is a potential intermediate for pharmaceuticals. We found that (-)-vibo-quercitol is stereoselectively synthesized from 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose by the reductive reaction of a novel (-)-vibo-quercitol 1-dehydrogenase found in the proteomes of Burkholderia, Pseudomonas, and Arthrobacter. Among them, Burkholderia terrae sp. AKC-020 (40-1) produced a (-)-vibo-quercitol 1-dehydrogenase appropriate for synthesizing (-)-vibo-quercitol with a high diastereomeric excess. The enzyme was strongly induced in Bu. terrae cells when quercitol or 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose was used as carbon source in the culture medium. The enzyme is NAD(H)-dependent and shows highly specific activity for (-)-vibo-quercitol and myo-inositol among the substrates tested.

28855122	10.1016/j.nbt.2017.08.009	Bacterial isolates degrading ritalinic acid-human metabolite of neuro enhancer methylphenidate.	The consumption of nootropic drugs has increased tremendously in the last decade, though the studies on their environmental fate are still scarce. Nootropics are bioactive compounds designed to alter human's physiology therefore the adverse effects towards wildlife can be expected. In order to understand their environmental impact, the knowledge on their transformation pathways is necessary. Methylphenidate belongs to the most prescribed neuro-enhancers and is among the most favored smart drugs used in non-medical situations. It is metabolized in human liver and excreted as ritalinic acid. Here, we showed for the first time that ritalinic acid can be biodegraded and used as a sole carbon and nitrogen source by various microbial strains originating from different environmental samples. Five axenic strains were isolated and identified as: Arthrobacter sp. strain MW1, MW2 and MW3, Phycicoccus sp. strain MW4 and Nocardioides sp. strain MW5.

28715480	10.1371/journal.pone.0180517	Tales of diversity: Genomic and morphological characteristics of forty-six Arthrobacter phages.	The vast bacteriophage population harbors an immense reservoir of genetic information. Almost 2000 phage genomes have been sequenced from phages infecting hosts in the phylum Actinobacteria, and analysis of these genomes reveals substantial diversity, pervasive mosaicism, and novel mechanisms for phage replication and lysogeny. Here, we describe the isolation and genomic characterization of 46 phages from environmental samples at various geographic locations in the U.S. infecting a single Arthrobacter sp. strain. These phages include representatives of all three virion morphologies, and Jasmine is the first sequenced podovirus of an actinobacterial host. The phages also span considerable sequence diversity, and can be grouped into 10 clusters according to their nucleotide diversity, and two singletons each with no close relatives. However, the clusters/singletons appear to be genomically well separated from each other, and relatively few genes are shared between clusters.

This study examined the performance of the chitosan-immobilized cadmium-resistant bacteria Arthrobacter sp. and Micrococcus sp. on cadmium phytoremediation by Chlorophytum laxum in cadmium-polluted soil. These immobilized cadmium-resistant bacteria can survive in cadmium-contaminated soil and significantly increased soil cadmium solubility, but the ability of chitosan-immobilized cells to increase cadmium solubility was lower than that of free cells. A pot experiment demonstrated that chitosan-immobilized Micrococcus sp. promoted the growth of C. laxum planted in cadmium-contaminated soil. A significant increase in the cadmium concentration in the roots and aboveground parts of C. laxum was found in plants inoculated with free and chitosan-immobilized cells of these bacteria. The performance of Arthrobacter sp. free cells to augment cadmium accumulation in C. laxum was a little bit better than that of chitosan-immobilized Arthrobacter sp., except at 9..weeks after planting.

Furthermore, some PSB isolates, such as Micromonospora sp., Aminobacter sp., and Arthrobacter sp., were shared by the IPB and OPB. Thus, some IPB species functioned as OPB and vise versa, which could be further reflected by a negative and significant relationship between PSB (IPB..+..OPB) number and content of CaCO3...P together with acid-soluble organic phosphorus (ASOP).

The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is an endangered species restricted to several areas of Spain and Portugal. Its low genetic diversity likely provokes immune depression and high susceptibility to infectious diseases. The intestinal microbiota is closely related to host health and nutrition. In order to contribute to the knowledge of the Iberian lynx intestinal microbiota, fecal microbiota of captive specimens from two breeding centers ("La Olivilla" and "El Acebuche"), located in Southern Spain, were studied by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Results grouped microbiota in two main clusters (I and III) which included DGGE patterns of 19 out of 36 specimens, cluster I being the most frequent in "La Olivilla" (50%) and cluster III in "El Acebuche" (55.55 %) specimens.

Microflora of the gastrointestinal tract plays important roles in food digestion, nutrient absorption and in host defense against ingested pathogens. Several studies have focused on the microflora of farmed fishes, but the gut flora of wild fishes remains poorly characterized. The aim of this work was to provide an overview of the bacteria colonizing the gut of wild-caught fishes and to determine whether some bacterial species can be pathogenic. We isolated cultivable bacteria from fifteen wild-caught Mediterranean fish species corresponding to different habitat, diet and origin. Bacterial species identity was determined by 16s rRNA gene sequencing for the 61 isolates. The potential pathogenicity of isolated bacteria was investigated using fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) as model organisms.

Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase (BVMO)-mediated regiodivergent conversions of asymmetric ketones can lead to the formation of "normal" or "abnormal" lactones. In a previous study, we were able to change the regioselectivity of a BVMO by mutation of the active-site residues to smaller amino acids, which thus created more space. In this study, we demonstrate that this method can also be used for other BVMO/substrate combinations.

The host's mucosal immune system must tolerate commensals while fighting pathogens. One of the mechanisms used by the mucosal immune system to maintain homeostasis is the secretion of immunoglobulins (Igs) across epithelial barriers, which is achieved via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). Rainbow trout pIgR is known to transport IgT and IgM across epithelia. However, other biological functions for trout pIgR or trout secretory component (tSC) remain unknown. This study investigates the interaction of tSC with commensal bacteria, pathogenic bacteria and a fungal pathogen. Our results show that the majority of trout skin and gut bacteria are coated in vivo by tSC.

This is the first report on a myophage that infects Arthrobacter A novel virus, vB_ArtM-ArV1 (ArV1), was isolated from soil using Arthrobacter sp. strain 68b for phage propagation. Transmission electron microscopy showed its resemblance to members of the family Myoviridae: ArV1 has an isometric head (...74 nm in diameter) and a contractile, nonflexible tail (...192 nm). Phylogenetic and comparative sequence analyses, however, revealed that ArV1 has more genes in common with phages from the family Siphoviridae than it does with any myovirus characterized to date. The genome of ArV1 is a linear, circularly permuted, double-stranded DNA molecule (71,200 bp) with a GC content of 61.6%.

Current study aimed to discover both kinetic and microbial response of activated sludge biomass to continuous exposure to tetracycline, one of the most frequently detected antibiotics in wastewaters. Respirometric analysis and model evaluation of the oxygen utilization rate profiles generated at critical phases of the experimental period showed that, continuous exposure to tetracycline caused complete suppression of substrate storage aside from mild inhibition on the growth kinetics and it exerted a significant binding action with available organic carbon, leading to less oxygen consumption. Additionally, increase in endogenous decay rates by 1.5 fold was associated with maintenance energy dictated by the presence and production of antibiotic resistance genes, as demonstrated by resistance gene profile.

30277309	10.1111/1751-7915.13319	Factors influencing pigment production by halophilic bacteria and its effect on brine evaporation rates.	The disposal of reject brine, a highly concentrated waste by-product generated by various industrial processes, represents a major economic and environmental challenge. The common practice in dealing with the large amounts of brine generated is to dispose of it in a pond and allow it to evaporate. The rate of evaporation is therefore a key factor in the effectiveness of the management of these ponds. The addition of various dyes has previously been used as a method to increase the evaporation rate. In this study, a biological approach, using pigmented halophilic bacteria (as opposed to chemical dyes), was assessed. Two bacteria, an Arthrobacter sp. and a Planococcus sp. were selected due to their ability to increase the evaporation of synthetic brine. When using industrial brine, supplementation of the brine with an iron source was required to maintain the pigment production. Under these conditions, the Planococcus sp.

30120889	10.1002/bab.1686	Biosurfactants from probiotic bacteria: A review.	Among microorganisms, bacteria are the main group of biosurfactant-producing organisms. Different types of bacteria including Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter sp., Bacillus sp., and Arthrobacter sp. are among the most commonly studied bacteria in the realm of scientific research. However, due to the pathogenic nature of the producing organisms, the application of these compounds is restricted, therefore, not suitable for use in food-related industries. Given that probiotic bacteria impact human health, applying probiotics as nonpathogenic and safe organisms have gained much attention for the production of biosurfactants in recent years. Most biosurfactants obtained from probiotic bacteria are related to a number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). These types of biosurfactants are classified based on their structures as protein-carbohydrate complexes, lipids, or fatty acids.

29800910	10.1016/j.jhazmat.2018.05.020	Carbon-dependent chromate toxicity mechanism in an environmental Arthrobacter isolate.	Arthrobacter spp. are widespread in soil systems and well-known for their Cr(VI) reduction capabilities making them attractive candidates for in situ bioremediation efforts. Cellulose drives carbon flow in soil systems; yet, most laboratory studies evaluate Arthrobacter-Cr(VI) interactions solely with nutrient-rich media or glucose. This study aims to determine how various cellulose degradation products and biostimulation substrates influence Cr(VI) toxicity, reduction, and microbial growth of an environmental Arthrobacter sp. isolate. Laboratory culture-based studies suggest there is a carbon-dependent Cr(VI) toxicity mechanism that affects subsequent Cr(VI) reduction by strain LLW01.

29775827	10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.05.017	Responses of atrazine degradation and native bacterial community in soil to Arthrobacter sp. strain HB-5.	The bioremediation of soil contaminated with organic pesticides is a safe and effective approach to remove pollutants from the soil. However, whether the invasion of foreign aid organisms affects the local organisms has received increasing attention in recent years. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the degradation ability of atrazine by the strain HB-5 and evaluate its effects on natural bacterial communities in a miniature pot experiment. Results showed that HB-5 accelerated the degradation of atrazine and the degradation half-life of atrazine was 3.3 times less than the natural soil. Additionally, HB-5 increased the quantities of indigenous bacteria, the microbial biomass carbon and the Shannon, Simpson and McIntosh diversity indices of soil microbes in its early stage of use, But these parameters in soil treated with HB-5 decreased to values as low as those found in the control at the later stage of incubation. These suggested that the bacteria vanished as atrazin	2018	9	20	Ecotoxicol Environ Saf	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	Atrazine; Biolog; Degrading strain HB-5; Soil microbes; Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Herbicides; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants	Gao	Jianpeng

ZXY-2: an attempt to lay the foundation for potential bioaugmentation applications.	The isolation of atrazine-degrading microorganisms with specific characteristics is fundamental for bioaugmenting the treatment of wastewater containing atrazine. However, studies describing the specific features of such microorganisms are limited, and further investigation is needed to improve our understanding of bioaugmentation. In this study, strain Arthrobacter sp. ZXY-2, which displayed a strong capacity to degrade atrazine, was isolated and shown to be a potential candidate for bioaugmentation. The factors associated with the biodegrading capacity of strain ZXY-2 were investigated, and how these factors likely govern the metabolic characteristics that control bioaugmentation functionality was determined. The growth pattern of Arthrobacter sp. ZXY-2 followed the Haldane-Andrews model with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 52.76..mg..L<sup>-1</sup>, indicating the possible augmentation of wastewater treatment with relatively high atrazine concentrations (&gt;...50..ppm).

Chlorimuron-ethyl and atrazine are two herbicides with long half-lives in soil; their long-term and excessive application has led to a series of environmental problems. In this study, the strains Chenggangzhangella methanolivorans CHL1 and Arthrobacter sp. ART1 were combined and used for the remediation of chlorimuron-ethyl, atrazine and combined contaminated soils in a microcosm experiment. Changes in chlorimuron-ethyl and atrazine concentrations in soils were monitored, and variations in the soil microbial community were studied by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The two inoculated degrading strains accelerated the degradation of chlorimuron-ethyl and atrazine in soil, especially in the combined contaminated soil. Addition of the two herbicides and their combination generally decreased the concentrations of total PLFAs, total bacterial PLFAs, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial PLFAs and Shannon-Wiener indices, and changed microbial community composition, whilst stimul	2018	7	13	PLoS One	PloS one	Analysis of Variance; Atrazine; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Herbicides; Microbiota; Pyrimidines; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonylurea Compounds; Time Factors	Wang	Jian

This work mainly aims to explore the potential of synergistic use of cadmium-resistant bacteria and Napier grass to promote cadmium phytoremediation and the possibility of using the harvested Napier grass for biomass fuel. A pot experiment was carried out by transplanting Napier grass with and without bacterial inoculation in cadmium contaminated soil for 6 months. The results found that Micrococcus sp. significantly promoted the shoot biomass of Napier grass but not the root biomass. Micrococcus sp. and Arthrobacter sp. stimulated cadmium accumulation in the root and the shoot. Cadmium was retained more in the root than the shoot at all plantation periods. The maximum cadmium content in a whole plant was found in plants inoculated with Micrococcus sp. at six months. The values of phytoextraction coefficient and bioaccumulation factor in plants with bacterial inoculation were higher than those in the uninoculated control. Translocation factor was very low.

Myo-inositol (inositol) is important in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and functional food industries. Here, we report a novel pathway to produce inositol from glucose by a trienzymatic cascade system involving polyphosphate glucokinase (PPGK), inositol 1-phosphate synthase (IPS) and inositol monophosphatase (IMP). The system contained three highly active enzymes, AspPPGK from Arthrobacter sp. OY3WO11, TbIPS from Trypanosoma brucei TREU927, and EcIMP from Escherichia coli. A trienzymatic cascade reaction was implemented, and the conversion ratio from glucose to inositol reached 90%, which is promising for the enzymatic synthesis of inositol without ATP supplementation.	2018	9	17	Enzyme Microb Technol	Enzyme and microbial technology	Inositol monophosphatase; Inositol-1-phosphate synthase; Myo-inositol; Polyphosphate glucokinase; Trienzymatic cascade; Arthrobacter; Biosynthetic Pathways; Biotechnology; Escherichia coli; Glucose; Inositol; Kinetics; Myo-Inositol-1-Phosphate Synthase; Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases; Phosphotransferases; Recombinant Proteins; Trypanosoma brucei brucei	Lu	Yiping
29495658	10.1021/acs.est.7b06599	Isotope Fractionation Pinpoints Membrane Permeability as a Barrier to Atrazine Biodegradation in Gram-negative Polaromonas sp. Nea-C.	Biodegradation of persistent pesticides like atrazine often stalls at low concentrations in the environment. While mass transfer does not limit atrazine degradation by the Gram-positive Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 at high concentrations (&gt;1 mg/L), evidence of bioavailability limitations is emerging at trace concentrations (&lt;0.1 mg/L). To assess the bioavailability constraints on biodegradation, the roles of cell wall physiology and transporters remain imperfectly understood. Here, compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) demonstrates that cell wall physiology (i.e., the difference between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria) imposes mass transfer limitations in atrazine biodegradation even at high concentrations. Atrazine biodegradation by Gram-negative Polaromonas sp. Nea-C caused significantly less isotope fractionation (..(C) = -3.5 ...) than expected for hydrolysis by the enzyme TrzN (..(C) = -5.0 ...) and observed in Gram-positive Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 (..(C) = -5.	2019	9	17	Environ Sci Technol	Environmental science &amp; technology	Arthrobacter; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Isotopes; Chemical Fractionation; Nitrogen Isotopes; Permeability	Ehrl	Benno N

Identifying functional microorganisms involved in the degradation of high-molecular-mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HMM-PAHs) in agricultural soil environments could assist in developing bioremediation strategies for soil PAH contamination. Active populations of HMM-PAH degraders in agricultural soils are currently poorly understood. In this study, we identified aerobic pyrene-degrading bacteria in agricultural and industrial soils by [13C]pyrene incubations followed by DNA stable-isotope probing and high-throughput sequencing. More than 80% of pyrene was degraded during an incubation time of 35 days in both soils, with slower mineralization rates observed in agricultural soil compared with industrial soil. Members of the Pseudonocardia genus, not previously implicated in pyrene degradation, were the dominant pyrene-degrading population in agricultural soil; their relative abundance increased by three orders of magnitude.

SLG-6 isolated from activated sludge.	Two bacterial strains designated as Arthrobacter sp. SLG-4 and Rhodococcus sp. SLG-6, capable of utilizing di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP) as sole source of carbon and energy, were isolated from activated sludge. The analysis of DOP degradation intermediates indicated Arthrobacter sp. SLG-4 could completely degrade DOP. Whereas DOP could not be mineralized by Rhodococcus sp. SLG-6 and the final metabolic product was phthalic acid (PA). The proposed DOP degradation pathway by Arthrobacter sp. SLG-4 was that strain SLG-4 initially transformed DOP to PA via de-esterification pathway, and then PA was metabolized to protocatechuate acid and eventually converted to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle through meta-cleavage pathway. Accordingly, Phthalate 3,4-dioxygenase genes (phtA) responsible for PA degradation were successfully detected in Arthrobacter sp.

The metagenomic investigations indicated that our previously isolated sulfadiazine degrader, Arthrobacter sp. D2, and another Pimelobacter bacterium concomitantly occurred as most abundant members in the community of an enrichment culture that performed complete sulfadiazine mineralization for over two years. Responses of the enriched populations to sole carbon source alternation further suggested the ability of this Pimelobacter member to grow on 2-aminopyrimidine, the most prominent intermediate metabolite of sulfadiazine. Taking advantage of this propensity, additional cultivation procedures have enabled the successful isolation of Pimelobacter sp.

A self-immobilization method for microorganisms was developed based on fungal pellets. Generally, pellets have some problems such as cell leakage, cell loading limitation and low mechanical strength. Therefore, biochar was applied to overcome these disadvantages. Atrazine degradable microorganism Arthrobacter sp. ZXY-2 was immobilized by Aspergillus niger Y3 pellets. After adding biochar with optimal dosage (0.006...g biochar for 0.3...g pellets with ZXY-2), the self-immobilized biomixture (SIB) removed 50...mg /L atrazine rapidly within 1...h, which was 61% higher compared to pellets without biochar. The kinetic adsorption results showed that the biosorption of biochar by pellets followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The ATZ removal ability and reusability of SIB were significantly increased by biochar. The results showed that the addition of biochar could enhance the connection between ZXY-2 and pellets based carrier, and the favorable biodegradation pH of ZXY-2 changed to 6 	2020	12	11	J Hazard Mater	Journal of hazardous materials	Atrazine; Biochar; Biodegradation; Metabolic pathways; Mycelial pellets; Agrobacterium; Arthrobacter; Aspergillus niger; Atrazine; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Charcoal; Herbicides; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification	Yu	Tianmiao

31444737	10.1007/s12033-019-00208-z	Cloning and Characterization of a Chondroitin AC Exolyase from Arthrobacter sp. SD-04.	Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and their low-molecular weight derivates have received considerable interest in terms of their potential clinical applications, and display a wide variety of pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties. Structurally distinct GAG chains can be prepared by enzymatic depolymerization. A variety of bacterial chondroitin sulfate (CS) lyases have been identified, and have been widely used as catalysts in this process. Here, we identified a putative chondroitin AC exolyase gene, AschnAC, from an Arthrobacter sp. strain found in a CS manufacturing workshop. We expressed the enzyme, AsChnAC, recombinantly in Escherichia coli, then purified and characterized it in vitro. The enzyme indeed displayed exolytic cleavage activity toward HA and various CSs. Removing the putative N-terminal secretion signal peptide of AsChnAC improved its expression level in E. coli while maintaining chondroitin AC exolyase activity.

Aminotransferases have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary potential for the biosynthesis of chiral amines. Research on transaminase genes can facilitate their application to various fields. Herein, 89 putative aminotransferase genes potentially encoding useful biocatalysts were identified in three Bacillus strains genomes by genome annotation. Enzymes encoded by genes ota3, ota8, otae6, otae21, otaf1, otaf8, and otaf26 belong to pyridoxine 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme class IV. These seven ..-aminotransferase genes are highly conserved according to phylogenetic tree and bioinformatics analyses, as are the putative lysine catalytic residues in the corresponding enzymes (..-BPTA 1-7). The enzymes may possess similar activity to ..-aminotransferases from Arthrobacter sp. KNK 168. The potential application of these novel enzymes for the synthesis of medicinal amino compounds will be explored in future genetic engineering studies.	2020	2	10	J Appl Genet	Journal of applied genetics	Active site; Aminotransferase; Bioinformatics; Conserved domains; Genome analysis; Bacillus; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Computational Biology; DNA, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Multigene Family; Phylogeny; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Transaminases	Zhai	Lixin

Iron (Fe) is one of the key micronutrients essential for plant growth, yield and quality. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) and soybean (Glycine max) are important food crops but have relatively low Fe content in grains/seeds. Foliar application of Fe-invigorated bacteriosiderophore might increase Fe content in grain as well as improve overall plant growth. From a preliminary experiment conducted on soybean using 20 bacterial strains, Arthrobacter sp. (low siderophore producing) and Lysinibacillus fusiformis (high siderophore producing) were selected based on amount of siderophore produced and response of plants. This result was validated on field grown soybean and wheat crops by applying bacteriosiderophore with or without Fe on foliage. Siderophore was applied at flowering stage in both crops and observations were recorded on the sixth day after foliar spray.

31119710	10.1007/s42770-019-00094-2	Antifungal potential of Lauraceae rhizobacteria from a tropical montane cloud forest against Fusarium spp.	The occurrence of pests and diseases can affect plant health and productivity in ecosystems that are already at risk, such as tropical montane cloud forests. The use of naturally occurring microorganisms is a promising alternative to mitigate forest tree fungal pathogens. The objectives of this study were to isolate rhizobacteria associated with five Lauraceae species from a Mexican tropical montane cloud forest and to evaluate their antifungal activity against Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum. Fifty-six rhizobacterial isolates were assessed for mycelial growth inhibition of Fusarium spp. through dual culture assays. Thirty-three isolates significantly reduced the growth of F. solani, while 21 isolates inhibited that of F. oxysporum. The nine bacterial isolates that inhibited fungal growth by more than 20% were identified through 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis; they belonged to the genera Streptomyces, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus.

The current, Danish cardboard recycling system can be improved by increasing the kinds of cardboard products that can be recycled to include e.g. used beverage cartons and pizza boxes (i.e. an expanded cardboard fraction (ECF)). This study aims to obtain knowledge about exposure to airborne endotoxin and microorganisms at species level at different collection frequencies of ECF, and whether an increase in waste sorted fractions means that each waste fraction is collected less frequently. Bacterial and endotoxin concentrations were associated significantly with temperature inside the waste containers and endotoxin and fungal exposures with collection frequency. The concentration of fungi was highest at the truck back and for reduced collection frequencies.

Piceatannol is a valuable natural polyphenol with therapeutic potential in cardiovascular and metabolic disease treatment. In this study, we screened for microorganisms capable of producing piceatannol from resveratrol via regioselective hydroxylation. In the first screening, we isolated microorganisms utilizing resveratrol, phenol, or 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as a carbon source for growth. In the second screening, we assayed the isolated microorganisms for hydroxylation of resveratrol. Using this screening procedure, a variety of resveratrol-converting microorganisms were obtained. One Gram-negative bacterium, Ensifer sp. KSH1, and one Gram-positive bacterium, Arthrobacter sp. KSH3, utilized 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid as a carbon source for growth and efficiently hydroxylated resveratrol to piceatannol without producing any detectable by-products.

Compositions of pollutant-catabolic consortia and interactions between community members greatly affect the efficiency of pollutant catabolism. However, the relationships between community structure and efficiency of catabolic function in pollutant-catabolic consortia remain largely unknown. In this study, an original enrichment (AT) capable of degrading atrazine was obtained. And two enrichments - with a better/worse atrazine-degrading efficiency (ATB/ATW) - were derived from the original enrichment AT by continuous sub-enrichment with or without atrazine. Subsequently, an Arthrobacter sp. strain, AT5, that was capable of degrading atrazine was isolated from enrichment AT. The bacterial community structures of these three enrichments were investigated using high-throughput sequencing analysis of the 16S rRNA gene.

Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) play crucial roles in the cell metabolism and provide an unsurpassed diversity of catalysed reactions. Here, we report the identification and biochemical characterization of two P450s from Arthrobacter sp., a Gram-positive organism known to degrade the opium alkaloid papaverine. Combining phylogenetic and genomic analysis suggested physiological roles for P450s in metabolism and revealed potential gene clusters with redox partners facilitating the reconstitution of the P450 activities in vitro. CYP1232F1 catalyses the para demethylation of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid to homovanillic acid while CYP1232A24 continues demethylation to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Interestingly, the latter enzyme is also able to perform both demethylation steps with preference for the meta position.

Bacteria able to degrade pyrene play a critical role in the biodegradation of high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, the traditional isolation procedure only obtains strains related to the genus Mycobacterium. The aim of the present study was to develop a modified method to isolate taxonomically distinct pyrene-degrading strains. The results indicated that replacing pyrene with phenanthrene in the isolation step improved the isolation efficiency. Using the modified method, six PAH degraders belonging to the genera Bosea, Arthrobacter, Paenibacillus, Bacillus, and Rhodococcus were obtained. They were capable of effectively utilizing pyrene (...100%) as their sole carbon source, and could co-metabolize the degradation of benzo [a]pyrene (26.9-71.5%).

30679427	10.1038/s41467-018-08280-w	Copper amine oxidases catalyze the oxidative deamination and hydrolysis of cyclic imines.	Although cyclic imines are present in various bioactive secondary metabolites, their degradative metabolism remains unknown. Here, we report that copper amine oxidases, which are important in metabolism of primary amines, catalyze a cyclic imine cleavage reaction. We isolate a microorganism (Arthrobacter sp. C-4A) which metabolizes a ..-carboline alkaloid, harmaline. The harmaline-metabolizing enzyme (HarA) purified from strain C-4A is found to be copper amine oxidase and catalyze a ring-opening reaction of cyclic imine within harmaline, besides oxidative deamination of amines. Growth experiments on strain C-4A and Western blot analysis indicate that the HarA expression is induced by harmaline. We propose a reaction mechanism of the cyclic imine cleavage by HarA containing a post-translationally-synthesized cofactor, topaquinone.

Isoprene, the highly reactive volatile organic compound, is used as monomer for the synthesis of several useful polymers. Its extensive production and usage leads to contamination of air. Once released, it alters the atmospheric chemistry by reacting with hydroxyl radicals (OH) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to generate tropospheric ozone. Its prolonged exposure causes deleterious effects in human and plants. Therefore, its removal from the contaminated environment through biodegradation, provides a promising remedial solution. In the present study, isoprene utilizing bacteria namely, Pseudomonas sp., Arthrobacter sp., Bacillus sp. Sphingobacterium sp., Sphingobium sp., and Pantoea sp. were isolated and characterized from leaf surface of Madhuca latifolia and Tectona grandis, and also from soils under these plants.

Four new Ascomycete fungi capable of degrading diesel oil were isolated from sediments of a river estuary mainly contaminated by shipyard fuels or diesel oil. The isolates were identified as species of Lambertella, Penicillium, Clonostachys, and Mucor. The fungal candidates degraded and adsorbed the diesel oil in suspension cultures. The Lambertella sp. isolate displayed the highest percentages of oxidation of diesel oil and was characterised by the capacity to utilise the latter as a sole carbon source. This isolate showed extracellular laccase and Mn-peroxidase activities in the presence of diesel oil. It was tested for capacity to accelerate the process of decontamination of total petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated sediments, co-composted with lignocellulosic residues and was able to promote the degradation of 47.6% of the TPH contamination (54,074........321...mg TPH/Kg of sediment) after two months of incubation.

So far, the relative importance of the plant and its microbiome in the development of early stages of plant seedling growth under arsenic stress has not been studied. To test the role of endophytic bacteria in increasing plant success under arsenic stress, gnotobiotic seeds of J. montana were inoculated with two endophytic bacteria: Pantoea conspicua MC-K1 (PGPB and As resistant bacteria) and Arthrobacter sp.

In holobiotic seedlings (with seed-vectored microbes intact), neither the capacity of germination nor development of roots and lateral hairs was affected at 125 ..M As(V). However, in gnotobiotic seedlings, the plants are negatively impacted by absence of a microbiome and presence of arsenic, resulting in reduced growth of roots and root hairs.

Nicotine is a major N-heterocyclic aromatic alkaloid produced in tobacco plants and the main toxic chemical in tobacco waste. Due to its complex physiological effects and toxicity, it has become a concern both in terms of public health and the environment. A number of bacteria belonging to the genera Arthrobacter and Pseudomonas can degrade nicotine via the pyridine and pyrrollidine pathways. Recently, a novel hybrid of the pyridine and pyrrolidine pathways (also known as the VPP pathway) was found in the Rhizobiale group bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens S33, Shinella sp. HZN7 and Ochrobactrum sp. SJY1 as well as in other group bacteria. The special mosaic pathway has attracted much attention from microbiologists in terms of the study of their molecular and biochemical mechanisms.

In this study, we investigated the actinobacterial diversity associated with an endemic Antarctic species, Deschampsia antarctica, by integrated culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and acknowledged this niche as a reservoir of bioactive strains for the production of antitumour compounds. The 16S rRNA-based analysis showed the predominance of the Actinomycetales order, a well-known group of bioactive metabolite producers belonging to the Actinobacteria phylum. Cultivation techniques were applied, and 72 psychrotolerant Actinobacteria strains belonging to the genera Actinoplanes, Arthrobacter, Kribbella, Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Pilimelia, Pseudar	2021	2	9	Sci Rep	Scientific reports	Actinobacteria; Actinomycetales; Antarctic Regions; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents; Biological Factors; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Culture Techniques; Dactinomycin; Drug Discovery; Humans; Neoplasms; Streptomyces	Silva	Leonardo Jose

Life cycle assessment (LCA) has proven to be a useful tool in assessing environmental technologies in a retrospective manner. To fully uncover the environmental improvement potential while advancing technologies under technical and environmental constraints, this study recommended approaching the LCA proactively to assess the progress of parameter optimization before determining critical parameters. To that end, the present work introduced a multimethod eight-step (MMES) analysis scheme, which included an integration of LCA with Plackett-Burman multifactorial design, central composite design, and multi-objective optimization. By creating a large number of scenarios through experimental design, we jointly optimized technical efficiency and environmental sustainability, which allowed for the identification of critical parameters that likely had contradictory influences on different objectives.

The effect of fungicides, commonly used in vine cultures, on the health of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems has been poorly studied. The objective of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of three viticulture fungicides (myclobutanil, cymoxanil, and azoxystrobin) on non-target organisms, the bacteria Rhodopirellula rubra, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and Arthrobacter sp., the microalgae Raphidocelis subcapitata, and the macrophyte Lemna minor. Fungicide toxicity was performed in acute cell viability assay for bacteria; 72-h and 7-day growth inhibition tests for R. subcapitata and L. minor, respectively. Contents of photosynthetic pigments and lipid peroxidation in L. minor were evaluated. Arthrobacter sp. and P. putida showed resistance to these fungicides. Even though azoxystrobin affected R. rubra and E. coli cell viability, this effect was due to the solvent used, acetone.

Environmental contamination by hydrocarbons is a major problem, and hydrocarbon accumulation in soil poses hazardous threat to ecosystems. Phytoremediation, which involves plants, is an encouraging technique for the removal of hydrocarbons from polluted soil and water. The purpose of this investigation was to examine whether bacterial inoculation enhanced the phytoremediation of hydrocarbons in diesel-contaminated soil vegetated with maize (Zea mays L.). The two cultivars of maize, MMRI Yellow and Pearl White, were planted in diesel-polluted soil (0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5..g diesel kg<sup>-1</sup> soil), and inoculated with the consortium of three alkane-degrading bacterial strains, Arthrobacter oxydans ITRH49, Pseudomonas sp.

The global decrease in soil fertility leads to a new agricultural scenario where eco-friendly solutions play an important role. The plant growth promotion through the use of microbes, especially endophytes and rhizosphere microbiota, has been proposed as a useful solution. Several studies have shown that humic substances are suitable vehicles for the inoculation of plant growth promoting bacteria, and that this combination has an enhanced effect on the stimulation of plant development. In this work, cucumber plants grown hydroponically have been pre-treated with a sedimentary humic acid (SHA) with known plant growth-enhancing effects, and culturable bacterial endophytes have been isolated from these plants. The hypothesis was that this pre-treatment with SHA could lead to the isolation of certain endophytic taxa whose proliferation within the plant could have been promoted as a result of the effects of the treatment with SHA, and that could eventually reinforce a potential synergistic 	2020	9	28	Front Plant Sci	Frontiers in plant science	cucumber; endophyte; humic; microbiota; phosphate solubilizing bacteria; plant growth promotion	De Hita	David

Salinity and phosphorus (P) deficiency are among the most serious soil factors constraining crop productivity. A proposed strategy for alleviating these stresses is supporting plants by inoculation with growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Here, a comparison of the ability of two maize composite and two F1 hybrid varieties to tolerate a P deficiency in either a saline or a non-saline environment showed that the uptake of nutrients by all four entries was significantly reduced by the imposition of both soil salinity and P deficiency, and that their growth was compromised to a similar extent. Subsequently, the ameliorative effect of inoculation with three strains of either Arthrobacter sp. or Bacillus sp. in an environment, which suffered simultaneously from salinity and P deficiency, was investigated. Inoculation with each of the strains was found to limit the plants' uptake of sodium cations, to increase their uptake of potassium cations, and to enhance their growth.

It is known that they can be degraded by various bacteria in the environment; however, the degradation of unsubstituted pyridine has not yet been completely resolved. In this study, we present data on the pyridine catabolic pathway in Arthrobacter sp. strain 68b at the level of genes, enzymes, and metabolites. The pyr gene cluster, responsible for the degradation of pyridine, was identified in a catabolic plasmid, p2MP. The pathway of pyridine metabolism consisted of four enzymatic steps and ended by the formation of succinic acid. The first step in the degradation of pyridine proceeds through a direct ring cleavage catalyzed by a two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase system, encoded by pyrA (pyridine monooxygenase) and pyrE genes.

In Earth's near-surface environments, gold biogeochemical cycling involves gold dissolution and precipitation processes, which are partly attributed to bacteria. These biogeochemical processes as well as abrasion (via physical transport) are known to act upon gold particles, thereby resulting in particle transformation including the development of pure secondary gold and altered morphology, respectively. While previous studies have inferred gold biogeochemical cycling from gold particles obtained from natural environments, little is known about how metal contamination in an environment could impact this cycle. Therefore, this study aims to infer how potentially toxic metal contaminants could affect the structure and chemistry of gold particles and therefore the biogeochemical cycling of gold.

As a prebiotics, lactosucrose plays an important role in maintaining human gastrointestinal homeostasis. In this study, a thermostable enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. 10138 was screened from six ..-fructofuranosidase-producing strains for the lactosucrose production and the coding gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli for efficient expression. Recombinant ..-fructofuranosidase was purified and biochemically characterized by MALDI-TOFMS spectrometry. The transfructosylation product by this recombinant enzyme was determined to be lactosucrose rather than other oligosaccharides or polysaccharides by HPLC and LC-MS. Efficient extracellular secretion of ..-fructofuranosidase was achieved by the optimization of signal peptide and induction conditions. It was found that with the signal peptide torT, the highest extracellular activity reached 111.01..U/mL, which was 38.4-fold higher than that with the OmpA signal peptide.

32091522	10.1039/c9em00503j	Compound-specific chlorine isotope fractionation in biodegradation of atrazine.	Atrazine is a frequently detected groundwater contaminant. It can be microbially degraded by oxidative dealkylation or by hydrolytic dechlorination. Compound-specific isotope analysis is a powerful tool to assess its transformation. In previous work, carbon and nitrogen isotope effects were found to reflect these different transformation pathways. However, chlorine isotope fractionation could be a particularly sensitive indicator of natural transformation since chlorine isotope effects are fully represented in the molecular average while carbon and nitrogen isotope effects are diluted by non-reacting atoms. Therefore, this study explored chlorine isotope effects during atrazine hydrolysis with Arthrobacter aurescens TC1 and oxidative dealkylation with Rhodococcus sp. NI86/21. Dual element isotope slopes of chlorine vs. carbon isotope fractionation (.. = 1.7 .. 0.9 vs. .. = 0.6 .. 0.1) and chlorine vs. nitrogen isotope fractionation (.. = -1.2 .. 0.7 vs. .. = 0.4 .. 0.2) provided reliab	2020	7	31	Environ Sci Process Impacts	Environmental science.

In this work, soil contaminated by petroleum resins was remediated by electrokinetic-bioremediation (EK-BIO) technology for 60 days. A microbial consortium, comprising Rhizobium sp., Arthrobacter globiformis, Clavibacter xyli, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus sp., was used to enhance the treatment performance. The results indicate that resin removal and phytotoxicity reduction were highest in the inoculated EK process, wherein 23.6% resins was removed from the soil and wheat seed germination ratio was increased from 47% to around 90% after treatment. The microbial counts, soil basal respiration and dehydrogenase activity were positively related to resins degradation, and they could be enhanced by direct current electric field. After remediation, the C/H ratio of resins decreased from 8.03 to 6.47.

In situ 1,4-dioxane bioremediation has recently been shown to be an effective remediation strategy. However, the presence/abundance of 1,4-dioxane degrading species across different environmental samples is generally unknown. Here, the objectives were to identify which 1,4-dioxane degrading functional genes are present and which genera may be using 1,4-dioxane and/or metabolites to support growth across different microbial communities. For this, laboratory sample microcosms and abiotic control microcosms (containing media) were inoculated with four uncontaminated soils and sediments from two contaminated sites.

Potato juice is a byproduct of starch processing currently used as feed. However, potato proteins are an untapped source of high-protein food for human nutrition if harmful constituents notably glycoalkaloids (GAs) are detoxified. The two principle GAs found in potato are ..-chaconine and ..-solanine, both consisting of a solanidine aglycone with a carbohydrate side chain. The first step in the detoxification of these compounds is the removal of the trisaccharide. Whole-genome sequencing of a bacterial isolate, Arthrobacter sp.

Functional characterization confirmed the enzymatic activity of the gene cluster involved in the complete deglycosylation of both ..-chaconine and ..-solanine.

CGMCC 3584 is used for the industrial production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, because of the paucity of genetic engineering tools for genetic manipulation on Arthrobacter species, only a few metabolically engineered Arthrobacter have been constructed and investigated. In this study, for the first time, we constructed an arpde knockout mutant of Arthrobacter without any antibiotic resistance marker by a PCR-targeting-based homologous recombination method. Our results revealed that the deletion of arpde had little effect on biomass production and improved cAMP production by 31.1%. Furthermore, we compared the transcriptomes of the arpde knockout strain and the wild strain, aiming to understand the capacities of cAMP production due to arpde inactivation at the molecular level. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that arpde inactivation had two major effects on metabolism: inhibition of glycolysis, PP pathway, and amino acid metabolism (pheny	2020	12	30	Bioprocess Biosyst Eng	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering	Arthrobacter; Knockout of arpde gene; Transcriptome; cAMP fermentation; Arthrobacter; Cyclic AMP; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genes, Bacterial	Niu	Huanqing

In unfavourable environment, such as nutrient limitation, some bacteria encased themselves into a three dimensional polymer matrix called biofilm. The majority of microbial infections in human are biofilm related, including chronic lung, wound, and ear infections. The matrix of biofilm which consists of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) causes bacterial colonization on medical implanted device in patients, such as catheter and lead to patient's death. Biofilm infections are harder to treat due to increasing antibiotic resistance compared to planktonic microbial cells and escalating the antibiotic concentration may result into in vivo toxicity for the patients.

The bacterial degradation of isoprene is important for maintaining its atmospheric concentration in unpolluted environment. It may be possible to use natural isoprene degrading bacteria in engineered systems to eliminate or limit isoprene emissions from various sources. Biodegradation of isoprene by Arthrobacter sp. strain BHU FT2 was investigated. The genome was found to contain 4151545..bp long chromosome having 3747 coding genes, and coded potential isoprene degrading enzymes. The molecular docking of monooxygenases with isoprene displayed a higher binding energy (-4.59..kcal/mol) for WP_015938387.1 monooxygenase. Analysis of the identified monooxygenases with the known isoprene monooxygenases revealed 67% sequence identity of WP_015938387.1 (Locus tag JHV56_10705) monooxygenase of the considered strain with the OPX16961.1 monooxygenase of Gordonia sp. i37 isoprene degrading starin.

Nicosulfuron is a sulfonylurea family herbicide which is commonly applied together with the triazine herbicide atrazine in agricultural practice. However, whether nicosulfuron can influence the biodegradation of atrazine is unclear. Therefore, the influence of nicosulfuron on atrazine removal as well as on cell viability and transcription of atrazine chlorohydrolase gene (trzN) in Arthrobacter sp.

Our results demonstrated that 76.0% of atrazine was degraded in the absence of nicosulfuron after 48h of culture, whereas 63.9, 49.1 and 42.6% was degraded in the presence of 1, 5, and 10..mg/L of nicosulfuron, respectively. Nicosulfuron also induced an increase in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby damaging the cell membrane integrity and inhibiting the growth of the strain DNS10.

Pyrene and chromium (Cr(VI)) are persistent pollutants and cause serious environmental problems because they are toxic to organisms and difficult to remediate. The toxicity of pyrene and Cr(VI) to three crops (cotton, soybean and maize) was confirmed by the significant decrease in root and shoot biomass during growth in pyrene/Cr(VI) contaminated hydroponic solution. Two bacterial strains capable of simultaneous pyrene biodegradation and Cr(VI) reduction were isolated and identified as Serratia sp. and Arthrobacter sp. A mixture of the isolated strains at a ratio of 1:1 was more efficient for biotreatment of pyrene and Cr(VI) than either strain alone; the mixture effectively carried out bioremediation of contaminated water in a hydroponic system mainly through pyrene biodegradation and Cr(VI) reduction.

36188007	10.3389/fmicb.2022.970147	Genome mining to unravel potential metabolic pathways linked to gallium bioleaching ability of bacterial mine isolates.	Gallium (Ga) is considered a high-tech Critical Metal, used in the manufacture of several microelectronic components containing either gallium arsenide (GaAs) or gallium nitride (GaN). The current high demand for this critical metal urges the development of effective recovery processes from secondary resources such as mine tailings or electronic recycling material. The importance of bioleaching as a biotechnological process to recover metals prompted this study, where an integrative approach combining experimental and genomic analysis was undertaken to identify potential mechanisms involved in bioleaching ability and strategies to cope with high metal(loid)s concentrations in five mine isolates. The Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) annotation showed that the "amino acid transport and metabolism" [E] was the most predominant functional category in all genomes.

Phytophthora is an important, highly destructive pathogen of many plants, which causes considerable crop loss, especially durians in Thailand. In this study, we selectively isolated Streptomyces from the rhizosphere soil with a potent anti-oomycete activity against Phytophthora palmivora CbP03. Two strains (SNN087 and SNN289) demonstrated exceptional plant growth-promoting properties in pot experiment. Both strains promoted mung bean (Vigna radiate) growth effectively in both sterile and non-sterile soils. Metagenomic analysis revealed that Streptomyces sp. SNN289 may modify the rhizosphere microbial communities, especially promoting microbes beneficial for plant growth. The relative abundance of bacterial genera Bacillus, Sphingomonas, Arthrobacter, and Pseudarthrobacter, and fungal genera Coprinellus and Chaetomium were noticeably increased, whereas a genus Fusarium was slightly reduced.

The genus Arthrobacter is a known group of Gram-positive, opportunistic pathogenic bacteria from cold climates, with members that are believed to play a variety of roles at low temperatures. However, their survival mechanisms in frigid environments like the Antarctic are still unknown. We identified a species of Arthrobacter isolated from seawater in the polar region using 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The strain PAMC25284 genome consists of a circular chromosome with a GC content of 65.6% and is projected to contain 3,588 genes, of which 3,150 are protein coding, 366 are pseudogenes, 19 are rRNA coding, and 50 are tRNA coding genes. Using comparative genomics, we showed that PMAC25284 has copper-transporting ATPases, copper chaperone, copper-responsive transcriptional regulator, and multi-copper oxidase domains, which are found in both Gram-positive (like Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Enterococcus hirae) and Gram-negative bacteria (like E. coli	2022	9	6	Int J Microbiol	International journal of microbiology	NA	Karmacharya	Jayram

The viable and degradation potential of the strains which adhered to soil minerals are essential for eliminating organic pollutants from soil. Herein, the interaction (growth, biofilm formation and survive) of Arthrobacter sp. DNS10, an atrazine degrading strain, with three kinds of typical soil minerals, such as montmorillonite, kaolinite and goethite, as well as the atrazine degradation gene (trzN) expression of the strain in the minerals system were studied. The results showed that montmorillonite had significant promotion effect on the growth of strain DNS10, followed by kaolinite, but goethite significantly inhibited the growth of strain DNS10. In contrast, goethite notably promoted the biofilm formation and there was less biofilm detected in montmorillonite containing system. The percentage of the survival bacteria in the biofilm that formed on montmorillonite, kaolinite and goethite was 53.8%, 40.8% and 28.2%.

In the cold regions of China, lignin-rich corn straw accumulates at high levels due to low temperatures. The application of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria should be an effective means of overcoming the low-temperature limit for lignin degradation and promoting the utilization of corn straw. However, this application is limited by the lack of suitable strains for decomposition of lignin; furthermore, the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria is unclear. Here, the whole genome of the psychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2, isolated in our previous work, was sequenced. Comparative genomics revealed that C2 contained unique genes related to lignin degradation and low-temperature adaptability.

35908235	10.1007/s11274-022-03344-y	Isolation and characterization of mimosine degrading enzyme from Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1.	Leucaena leucocephala growing in the tropics and subtropics serves as potential forage for livestock because its foliage is rich in protein, fiber, and minerals. However, its use for livestock feed has been hindered by toxic nonprotein amino acid mimosine. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to reduce or eliminate mimosine from foliage. A previous study found that the fermentation of L. leucocephala foliage reduced the mimosine content and prompted the authors to isolate potent mimosine degrading microorganisms and characterize the mimosinase for the complete elimination of mimosine in the L. leucocephala foliage. The soil screening of the L. leucocephala tree surroundings led to the isolation of Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1, which can degrade and assimilate mimosine as a nitrogen and carbon source.

35211835	10.1007/s12223-022-00959-4	Isolation and identification of multi-trait plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from coastal sand dune plant species of Pohang beach.	Rhizobacteria are root-associated bacteria that influence plant growth by various direct and indirect mechanisms. In quest of efficient plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with multiple plant growth-promoting traits, a total of 52 rhizobacterial isolates were isolated from the rhizospheric soil collected at Pohang beach, Republic of Korea. The bacterial isolates were evaluated in vitro for their plant growth-promoting traits like production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, and phosphate solubilization activities. More than 28% of the isolates revealed all of the multi-trait plant growth-promoting activities, whereas 11.54% exhibited robust results for producing IAA, ACC deaminase, siderophore, and phosphate solubilization activities. Similarly, 36% isolates were capable for the production of IAA, siderophore, and ACC deaminase, while 32% revealed phosphate solubilization and siderophore production.

Bioremediation systems coupled to efficient microbial enzymes have emerged as an attractive approach for the in-situ removal of hazardous organophosphates (OPs) pesticides from the polluted environment. However, the role of engineered enzymes in OPs-degradation is rarely studied. In this study, the potential OPs-hydrolase (opdH) gene (Arthrobacter sp.

35146604	10.1007/s11356-022-19121-1	Degradation of antibacterial 1-octylpyrrolidin-2-one by bacterial pairs isolated from river water and soil.	The study of bacterial degradation of 1-octylpyrrolidin-2-one (NOP) by river water and soil bacteria was the main aim of the research. Although the compound demonstrated bacteriostatic as well as bactericidal effects against Gram-positive and certain Gram-negative bacteria at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1000..mg L<sup>-1</sup>, its concentration of 100..mg L<sup>-1</sup> was successfully degraded by microbial communities of both river water and alluvial soil; removal efficiencies reached 87.2 and 88.4% of dissolved organic carbon, respectively. Isolation of the strains responsible for the process showed that bacterial degradation was initiated by the octane-utilising bacteria of the genus Phenylobacterium, which used four carbon atoms of the NOP octyl chain and oxidised terminal carbon atom of the remaining chain. The structure of the intermediate produced by phenylobacteria was elucidated following the results obtained from the detailed electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) a	2022	6	23	Environ Sci Pollut Res Int	Environmental science and pollution research international	1-Octylpyrrolidin-2-one; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Intermediate; Isolation; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Arthrobacter; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon; Rivers; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Water	Ruzicka	Jan

Some functional microorganisms in the soil immobilize heavy metals by adsorption and precipitation, prevent the absorption of heavy metals by crops, and play an important role in the passivation and remediation of medium and mild heavy metal-contaminated soil. A pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of the exogenous polyamine-producing bacterium Bacillus sp. N3 on Cd uptake and the bacterial community composition and function in the rhizosphere soil. The results showed that strain N3 significantly reduced the contents of Cd (64.7%) in wheat grain and DTPA-Cd (50.1%) in rhizosphere soil and increased the pH (from 6.84 to 6.97) and polyamine content. High-throughput sequencing results showed that inoculation of strain N3 reduced the diversity of the bacterial community; however, it increased the relative abundances of ..-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes in wheat rhizosphere soil.

35072982	10.1111/1462-2920.15914	Siderophores provoke extracellular superoxide production by Arthrobacter strains during carbon sources-level fluctuation.	Superoxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) shape microbial communities and drive the transformation of metals and inorganic/organic matter. Taxonomically diverse bacteria and phytoplankton produce extracellular superoxide during laboratory cultivation. Understanding the physiological reasons for extracellular superoxide production by aerobes in the environment is a crucial question yet not fully solved. Here, we showed that iron-starving Arthrobacter sp. QXT-31 (A. QXT-31) secreted a type of siderophore [deferoxamine (DFO)], which provoked extracellular superoxide production by A. QXT-31 during carbon sources-level fluctuation. Several other siderophores also demonstrated similar effects to A. QXT-31. RNA-Seq data hinted that DFO stripped iron from iron-bearing proteins in electron transfer chain (ETC) of metabolically active A. QXT-31, resulting in electron leakage from the electron-rich (resulting from carbon sources metabolism by A. QXT-31) ETC and superoxide production.
