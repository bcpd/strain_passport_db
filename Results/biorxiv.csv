Bacillus velezensis,113613,Exploration of endo-xylanase from novel strain of Bacillus velezensis AG20 isolated from the cave of Meghalaya,"Cave sets the example of extreme ecological niche and habitat for diversified microorganisms. Present study involved in the isolation of endoxylanase producing novel strain Bacillus velezensis AG20 from the Krem Phyllut cave, Meghalaya, India. Culture dependent studies, molecular phylogentics, RNA secondary folding pattern based on 16S rDNA substantiated the identity of this novel strain. Bacillus velezensis AG20 revealed the superbug quality having resistance against various class of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Bacillus velezensis AG20 revealed biofilm formation over the cell surface in FESEM. Highest cell biomass and xylanase production supported in TB medium, further purified partially to 5.3 fold with 21% yield. Molecular weight of the purified xylanase found to be 45 kDa. Enzyme kinetics and pattern of hydrolysis revealed the evidence for the selection of linear birchwood xylan with Vmax = 21.0 {+/-} 3.0 U/ml, Km = 1.25 mg/ml, Kcat = 1.75/s at optimum pH 7 and temperature 50{degrees}C also found significant statistically in Taguchis orthogonal design. Conversely, ruled out any exoacting activity against synthetic pNP-xylopyranoside substrate. Endo-xylanase isolated from Bacillus velezensis AG20 was moderately thermostable over temperatures 50 and 60{degrees}C. Time dependent hydrolysis of agro-waste sugar cane bagasse depicted the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) predominantly xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetrose. Purified mixed XOS hold their prebiotic potential by promoting the growth of probiotics Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus as well as high stability (~90%) against systemic fluids. Mixed XOS (300 g/ml) displayed anti-proliferation activities by reducing the growth of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells significantly 90% and 75%, respectively, after 48 h.

IMPORTANCEExtremophiles dwelling inside the caves have laden with the extraordinary capabilities of bioconversion by nature. The pristine ecological niche inside the cave, absence of proper light and air, supports the livelihood of novel microorganisms. In India, Meghalaya is hoisting longest caves in the East Khasi Hills, providing conducive environment for novel bacterial strains. With the prime objective of isolating novel bacterial strains that produce extracellular xylanase our studies have been carried out. Considering the present industrial demand for nutraceutical, prebiotics, anti-proliferating agents and biofuels by the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), novel enzymes are required. Xylanases from bacterial origin play a significant role in conversion of LCB into oligosaccharides. Therefore, exploration and characterization of xylanase producing novel isolate from cave may pave the new arena for the production of prebiotic and anti-inflammatory oligosaccharides from agro-waste.","Ghosh, A.; Mahanta, S.; Banerjee, S.; Baishya, D.",2020-04-07,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.04.06.028878,1,Debabrat  Baishya,Gauhati University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028878v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.06.028878v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Bacillus velezensis,162061,Surfactin stimulated by pectin molecular patterns and root exudates acts as a key driver of Bacillus-plant mutualistic interaction,"Bacillus velezensis is considered as model species belonging to the so-called B. subtilis complex that typically evolved to dwell in the soil rhizosphere niche and establish intimate association with plant roots. This bacterium provides protection to its natural host against diseases and represents one of the most promising biocontrol agents. However, the molecular basis of the cross-talk that this bacterium establishes with its natural host has been poorly investigated. We show here that these plant-associated bacteria have evolved some polymer-sensing system to perceive their host and that in response, they increase the production of the surfactin-type lipopeptide. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surfactin synthesis is favoured upon growth on root exudates and that this lipopeptide is a key component used by the bacterium to optimize biofilm formation, motility and early root colonization. In this specific nutritional context, the bacterium also modulates qualitatively the pattern of surfactin homologues co-produced in planta and mainly forms variants that are the most active at triggering plant immunity. Surfactin represents a shared good as it reinforces the defensive capacity of the host.

ImportanceWithin the plant-associated microbiome, some bacterial species are of particular interest due to the disease protective effect they provide via direct pathogen suppression and/or stimulation of host immunity. While these biocontrol mechanisms are quite well characterized, we still poorly understand the molecular basis of the cross talk these beneficial bacteria initiate with their host. Here we show that the model species Bacillus velezensis stimulates production of the surfactin lipopeptide upon sensing pectin as cell surface molecular pattern and upon feeding on root exudates. Surfactin favors bacterial rhizosphere fitness on one hand and primes the plant immune system on the other hand. Our data therefore illustrate how both partners use this multifunctional compound as unique shared good to sustain mutualistic interaction.","Hoff, G.; Arguelles Arias, A.; Boubsi, F.; Prsic, J.; Meyer, T.; Ibrahim, H.

Bacillus velezensis,176855,Bacillus velezensis stimulates resident rhizosphere Pseudomonas stutzeri for plant health through metabolic interactions,"Trophic interactions play a central role in driving microbial community assembly and function. In gut or soil ecosystems, successful inoculants are always facilitated by efficient colonization, however, the metabolite exchanges between inoculants and resident bacteria are rarely studied, particularly in the rhizosphere. Here, we used bioinformatic, genetic, transcriptomic and metabonomic analyses to uncover syntrophic cooperation between inoculant (Bacillus velezensis SQR9) and plant-beneficial indigenous Pseudomonas stutzeri in the cucumber rhizosphere. We found that the synergistic interaction of these two species is highly environmental dependent, the emergence of syntrophic cooperation was only evident in a static nutrient-rich niche, such as pellicle biofilm in addition to the rhizosphere. Our results identified branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) biosynthesis pathway involved in syntrophic cooperation when forming coculture biofilms. Assaying the metabolome further demonstrated metabolic facilitation among the bacterial strains. In addition, biofilm matrix components from Bacillus were essential for the interaction. Importantly, the two-species consortium promoted plant growth and helped plants alleviate salt stress. In summary, we propose a mechanism in which synergic interactions between a biocontrol bacterium and a partner species promote plant health.","Sun, X.; Xu, Z.; Xie, J.; Thomsen, V.

Bacillus velezensis,184728,The beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis acquires iron from roots via a type VII secretion system for colonization,"Niche colonization is the key for bacterial adaptation to the environment, and competition for iron largely determines root colonization by rhizosphere microbes. Pathogenic and beneficial symbiotic bacteria use various unique secretion systems to support plant colonization or acquire limited resources from the environment. However, ubiquitous nonsymbiotic beneficial rhizobacteria have never been reported to use a unique secretion system to facilitate colonization. Here, we show that the type VII secretion system (T7SS) of the beneficial rhizobacterium Bacillus velezensis SQR9 contributes to root colonization. Knocking out T7SS and the major secreted protein YukE in SQR9 caused a significant decrease in root colonization. Moreover, the T7SS and YukE caused iron loss in plant roots in the early stage after inoculation, which contributed to root colonization by SQR9. Interestingly, purified YukE, but not inactivated YukE, could change the permeability of root cells. We speculated that secreted YukE might be directly inserted into the root cell membrane to cause iron leakage, indicating that the bacterial protein and root cell membrane interact directly. Moreover, a bacterial siderophore and the T7SS may be coordinately involved in iron acquisition by B. velezensis SQR9 for efficient root colonization. We showed that the beneficial rhizobacterium B. velezensis SQR9 could acquire iron from roots via the T7SS for rapid colonization. These findings provide the first insight into the function of the unique secretion system in nonsymbiotic beneficial rhizobacteria and reveal a novel mutualism in which plants and bacteria might share iron in a sequential manner.","Liu, Y.; Shu, X.; Chen, L.; Zhang, H.; Feng, H.; Sun, X.; Xiong, Q.; Li, G.; Xun, W.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, N.; Pieterse, C.

Bacillus velezensis,192958,A unique genomic island-governed cannibalism in Bacillus enhanced biofilm formation through a novel regulation mechanism,"Cannibalism is a differentiation strategy and social multicellular behavior in biofilms. The novel factors and mechanisms to trigger the bacterial cannibalism remain scarce. Here, we report a novel bacillunoic acids-mediated strategy for manipulating cannibalism in Bacillus velezensis SQR9 biofilm formation. A subfraction of cells differentiate into cannibals that secrete toxic bacillunoic acids to lyse a fraction of their sensitive siblings, and the released nutrients enhance biofilm formation. Meanwhile, the self-immunity of cannibal cells was induced by bacillunoic acids. A two-component system, the OmpS-OmpR signal-transduction pathway, controls the expression of the ABC transporter BnaAB for self-immunity. Specifically, bacillunoic acids activate the autophosphorylation of OmpS, a transmembrane histidine kinase, which then transfers a phosphoryl group to its response regulator OmpR. The phosphorylation of OmpR activates the transcription of the transporter gene bnaAB by binding its promoter. Thus, bacillunoic acids are pumped out of cells by the ABC transporter BnaAB. Moreover, we discovered that strain SQR9 could use the bacillunoic acids-mediated cannibalism to optimize its community to produce more bacillunoic acids for bacterial competition. This study revealed that bacillunoic acids play a previously undiscovered dual role in both cannibalism during biofilm formation and interspecies competition, which has an important biological significance.","Huang, R.; Li, Q.; Wang, D.; Feng, H.; Zhang, N.; Shao, J.; Shen, Q.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, R.",2021-10-04,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.10.04.462985,1,Ruifu  Zhang,Nanjing Agricultural University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.462985v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.04.462985v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Bacillus velezensis,194342,Annulment of antagonism shifts properties that are beneficial to plants in two-member consortia of Bacillus velezensis,"Bacillus spp. strains that are beneficial to plants are widely used in commercial biofertilizers and biocontrol agents for sustainable agriculture. Generally, functional Bacillus strains are applied as single strain communities since the principles of synthetic microbial consortia constructed with Bacillus strains remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrated that the mutual compatibility directly affects the survival and function of two-member consortia composed of B. velezensis SQR9 and FZB42 in the rhizosphere. A mutation in the global regulator Spo0A of SQR9 markedly reduced the boundary phenotype with wild-type FZB42, and the combined use of the SQR9{triangleup}spo0A mutant and FZB42 improved biofilm formation, root colonization and the production of secondary metabolites that are beneficial to plants. We further confirmed the correlation between the swarm discrimination phenotype between the two consortia members and the effects that are beneficial to plants in a greenhouse experiment. Our results provide evidence that social interactions among bacteria could be an influencing factor in achieving a desired community-level function.

IMPORTANCEBacillus velezensis is one of the most widely applied bacteria in biofertilizers in China and Europe. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of plant growth promotion and disease suppression by representative model strains are well established, such as B. velezensis SQR9 and FZB42. However, it remains extremely challenging to design efficient consortia based on these model strains. Here, we showed that swarm discrimination phenotype is one of the major determinants affects the performance of two-member Bacillus consortia in vitro and in the rhizosphere. Deletion in global regulatory gene spo0A of SQR9 reduced the strength of boundary formation with FZB42, result in the improved plant growth promotion performance of dual consortium. This knowledge provides new insights into efficient probiotics consortia design in Bacillus.","Shao, J.; Liu, Y.; Xie, J.; Stefanic, P.; Lv, Y.; Fan, B.; Mandic-Mulec, I.; Zhang, R.; Xu, Z.; Shen, Q.",2021-10-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.10.13.464333,1,Zhihui  Xu,Nanjing Agricultural University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.13.464333v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.13.464333v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Bacillus velezensis,196567,Quorum sensing signal autoinducer-2 inhibits sporulation of Bacillus by interacting with RapC and functions across species,"Collective behavior of bacteria is regulated by quorum sensing (QS). Bacterial cells sense the density of the population and induce corresponding traits and developmental processes. Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a common QS signal that regulates behavior of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In spite of the plethora of processes described to be influenced by AI-2 in diverse Gram-negative bacteria, the AI-2-regulated processes in Bacilli are relatively unexplored. Previously, we demonstrated that AI-2 regulates root colonization of Bacillus velezensis SQR9, a well-studied plant beneficial rhizobacterium. Here, we describe a novel function for AI-2 in B. velezensis SQR9 related to development of dormant spores. AI-2 inhibited the initiation of spore development throught the phosphatase RapC and the DNA binding regulator ComA. Using mutant strains and protein-protein interaction studies, we demonstrate that AI-2 interacts with RapC to stimulate its binding to ComA and therefore inactive ComA. We further demonstrate that ComA is essential for Spo0A-regulated sporulation in B. velezensis SQR9. Finally, the AI-2 molecule could be shared cross species for inhibiting Bacillus sporulation. Our study revealed a novel function and regulation mechanism of AI-2 in sporulation inhibition of Bacilli that overall suggests sporulation to be a population-level decision process in Bacilli rather than just a individual cell behavior.

Author summaryQuorum sensing (QS) regulates many bacterial social behavior. Bacteria cells could moniter and respond cell density by sensing the self produced QS signals. While most QS signals are unique for either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, autoinducer-2 (AI-2) is a QS signal that could produced by both bacteria groups. However, knowledge of the mechanism of AI-2 affecting bacterial behavior is poorly understood. Here, we found AI-2 inhibite Bacillus velezensis SQR9 sporulation, a generally known bacterial individual behavior. We further revealed the mechanism of AI-2 influencing sporulation of B. velezensis SQR9 was dependent on RapC and ComA. AI-2 interacts with RapC to stimulate its binding to ComA and therefore inactive ComA, and then inhibited the Spo0A-regulated sporulation. Interestingly, we show B. velezensis SQR9 could also sense the AI-2 produced by other bacteria and reduce their own sporulation. Taken together we discovered the novel function of AI-2 in sporulation, which will expand the significance of QS signal that they regulate not only social behavior but also individual behavior of bacteria.","Xiong, Q.; Zhang, H.; Shu, X.; Sun, X.; Feng, H.; Xu, Z.; Kovacs, A.

Bacillus velezensis,219962,A toxin-mediated policing system in Bacillus improves population fitness via penalizing non-cooperating phenotypic cheaters,"Microbial cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by social cheaters. Although the strategies for controlling genotypic cheaters have been well investigated, the mechanism and significance of preventing phenotypic cheating remain largely unknown. Here, we revealed the molecular mechanism and ecological significance of a policing system for punishing phenotypic cheaters in the community of a plant beneficial strain Bacillus velezensis SQR9. Coordinated activation of extracellular matrix (ECM) production and autotoxin bacillunoic acids (BAs) biosynthesis/self-immunity, punished public goods-nonproducing cheaters in strain SQR9s community. Spo0A was identified to be the co-regulator for triggering both ECM production and BAs synthesis/immunity, which activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) to produce malonyl-CoA, an essential precursor for BAs biosynthesis, thereby stimulating BAs production and self-immunity. Elimination of phenotypic cheaters by this policing system, significantly enhanced population fitness under different stress conditions and in plant rhizosphere. This study provides insights into our understanding of maintenance and evolution of microbial cooperation.","Huang, R.; Shao, J.; Xu, Z.; Chen, Y.; Liu, Y.; Wang, D.; Feng, H.; Xun, W.; Shen, Q.; Zhang, N.; Zhang, R.",2022-05-14,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.05.14.491907,1,Nan  Zhang,Nanjing Agricultural University - Weigang Campus: Nanjing Agricultural University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.14.491907v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.14.491907v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Bacillus velezensis,37653,Inhibitory Effect of Bacillus velezensis on Biofilm Formation by Streptococcus mutans,"Streptococcus mutans plays a key role in the development of dental caries and promotes the formation of oral biofilm produced by glucosyltransferases (GTFs). Bacillus velezensis K68 was isolated from traditional fermented foods and inhibits biofilm formation mediated by S. mutans. Gene amplification results demonstrated that B. velezensis K68 contained genes for the biosynthesis of 1-deoxynojirimycin (1-DNJ), a known GTF expression inhibitor. The presence of the GabT1, Yktc1, and GutB1 genes required for 1-DNJ synthesis in B. velezensis K68 was confirmed. Supernatant from B. velezensis K68 culture medium inhibited biofilm formation by 84% when S. mutans was cultured for 48 h, and inhibited it maximally when 1% glucose was added to the S. mutans culture medium as a GTF substrate. In addition, supernatant from B. velezensis K68 medium containing 3 ppb 1- DNJ decreased S. mutans cell surface hydrophobicity by 79.0 {+/-} 0.8% compared with that of untreated control. The supernatant containing 1-DNJ decreased S. mutans adherence by 99.97% and 98.83% under sugar-dependent and sugar-independent conditions, respectively. S. mutans treated with the supernatant exhibited significantly reduced expression of the essential GTF genes gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD compared to that in the untreated group. Thus, B. velezensis inhibits the biofilm formation, adhesion, and GTF gene expression of S. mutans through 1- DNJ production.\n\nIMPORTANCEDental caries is among the most common infectious diseases worldwide, and its development is closely associated with physiological factors of bacteria, such as the biofilm formation and glucosyltransferase production of Streptococcus mutans. Biofilms are difficult to remove once they have formed due to the exopolysaccharide matrix produced by the microorganisms residing in them; thus, inhibiting biofilm formation is a current focal point of research into prevention of dental caries. This study describes the inhibitory properties of Bacillus velezensis K68, an organism isolated from traditional Korean fermented foods, against biofilm formation by S. mutans. Herein, we show that B. velezensis inhibits the biofilm formation, adherence to surfaces, and glucosyltransferase production of S. mutans.","Yoo, Y.; Seo, D.-H.; Lee, H.; Nam, Y.-D.; Seo, M.-J.",2018-05-04,Microbiology,10.1101/313965,1,Myung-Ji  Seo,Incheon National University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/313965v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/313965v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2019.04.009
Bacillus velezensis,55203,Plant Growth-Promoting Activity of Beta-Propeller Protein YxaL Secreted from Bacillus velezensis Strain GH1-13,"YxaL is conserved within Bacillus subtilis species complex associated with plant and soil. The mature protein YxaL contains a repeated beta-propeller domain, but the subcellular location and function of YxaL has not been determined. The gene encoding the mature YxaL protein was PCR amplified from genomic DNA of B. velezensis strain GH1-13 and used for recombinant protein production. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the purified YxaL was generated and used for western blotting to determine the constitutive expression and secretion of YxaL, which exhibited a half-life of 1.6 h in the culture medium of strain GH1-13. In this study, we show that seed treatments of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa L) with less than 1 mg L-1 of purified YxaL in a soaking solution were effective at improving the root growth of plants. The seedlings of the treated Arabidopsis seeds markedly increased transcription of a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthetase marker gene (ACS 11) but reduced expression of auxin-and abscisic acid-responsive marker genes (IAA1, GH3.3, and ABF4), especially when provided exogenous auxin. The horticulture experiments showed that pepper (Capsicum annum) seeds treated with 1 mg L-1 YxaL in soaking solution increased shoot growth and improved tolerance to drought stress. We hypothesize that YxaL secreted from plant growth-promoting Bacillus cells has a significant impact on plant roots, with the potential of improving plant growth and tolerance against stress.","Kim, Y.-H.; Choi, Y.; Oh, Y.

Bacillus paralicheniformis,213707,"Genome mining, phylogenetic, and functional analysis of arsenic (As) resistance operons in Bacillus strains, isolated from As-rich hot spring microbial mats","The geothermal zone of Araro, Mexico, is located within the trans-Mexican volcanic belt, an area with numerous arsenic (As)-rich hot springs. In this study, the draft genome sequence of two endemic Bacillus strains (ZAP17 and ZAP62) from Araro microbial mat hot springs was determined, which were able to grow on arsenate (up to 64 mM) and arsenite (up to 32 mM). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA and gyrB sequences, as well as genome sequence analysis based on average nucleotide identity (>96%) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (>70%), indicated that these strains belong to the Bacillus paralicheniformis ZAP17 and Bacillus altitudinis ZAP62. Furthermore, through genome mining, it was identified two arsenic resistance operons, arsRBC, and arsRBCDA in both strains as potential determinants of arsenic (As) resistance. Predicted ArsA (arsenial pump-driving ATPase), ArsB (Arsenical efflux pump protein), ArsC (Arsenate reductase), ArsD (Arsenical efflux pump protein) and ArsR (Metalloregulator/ars operon repressor) proteins, clearly grouped with their respective clades corresponding to other characterized bacterial species, mainly Firmicutes.

Finally, the presence of ars operons in the genome of Bacillus species residing in As-rich environments, such as the Araro hot springs, might be a potential mechanism to survive under such harsh conditions, as well as to design sustainable bioremediation strategies.","Flores, A.; Valencia-Marin, M.

Bacillus paralicheniformis,40567,"Biochemical, molecular and antibiotic resistance profile of multi-potential toluene metabolizing bacteria isolated from tannery effluents","The focus of present study was to isolate and characterize bacteria which can be effectively used for toluene, a highly recalcitrant pollutant, bioremediation. For isolation of bacteria from the tannery effluents selective enrichment and serial dilution methods were employed. The isolated bacteria were subjected to growth curve analysis, estimation of toluene removal efficiencies, biochemical tests, antibiotic sensitivity assays and molecular characterization based upon 16S rRNA gene. The rRNA genes sequences were analyzed through BLAST to determine similarity index of isolates with bacterial database sequences. To trace the evolutionary history, phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA version 7. Total twenty toluene metabolizing bacteria (IUBT1-2, 4-12, 16, 19, 21, 23-26, 28 and 30) were isolated and characterized. Their rRNA gene sequences have been submitted to Genbank. Fifteen of the twenty isolates showed homology to Brevibacillus agri strain NBRC 15538, four found similar to Bacillus paralicheniformis strain KJ-16 and one homologous to Burkholderia lata strain 383. All bacterial isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol but sensitive to teicoplanin and linezolid. However, few (i. e.; IUBT9 and 26) were sensitive to oxacillin. Biochemical characterization indicated all bacteria positive for alkaline phosphatases (100%). While many were found positive for p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl {beta}, D-glucosaminidase (35%), hydroxyproline {beta}-naphthylaminopeptidase (15%), esculinase (65%), mannitol (75%), sorbitol (95%) and inulin (90%) fermentation. Biochemical profile suggests the use of isolated bacteria for future exploitation in several fields like bioremediation of toluene, ethanol production, biomass hydrolysis, biosensors, biofertilizers, as a marker for milk pasteurization in dairy industries and evaluation of soil quality.\n\nImportanceToluene is a highly toxic environmental pollutant. We have isolated bacteria which can be effectively used for the removal of toluene from environmental resources. Moreover, these bacteria are capable to produce many valuable enzymes which can be used in many industrial processes for the production of a wide range of products. Further study may help to exploit these bacterial for the benefit of humanity.","Muccee, F.; Ejaz, S.",2018-06-06,Microbiology,10.1101/340240,1,Samina  Ejaz,"The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Pakistan",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/340240v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/340240v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1134/s0026261720050161

Bacillus megaterium,110832,A RNA-seq characterization of the porcine sperm microbiome.,"The microbiome plays a key role in homeostasis and health and it has been also linked to fertility and semen quality in several animal species including swine. Despite the more than likely importance of sperm bacteria on the boars reproductive ability and the dissemination of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance genes, a high throughput characterization of the swine sperm microbiome remains undone. The current study aimed at profiling the boar sperm bacterial population and its relationship with seven semen quality traits.

We carried RNA-seq on 40 ejaculates and we found that it contains a broad population of bacteria. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria (39.1%), Firmicutes (27.5%), Actinobacteria (14.9%) and Bacteroidetes (5.7%). The predominant species contaminated sperm after ejaculation from soil, faeces and water sources (Bacillus megaterium, Brachybacterium faecium, Bacillus coagulans). Some potential pathogens were also found but at relatively low levels (Escherichia coli, Clostridioides difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis). We also identified 3 potential antibiotic resistant genes from E. coli against chloramphenicol, Neisseria meningitidis against spectinomycin and Staphylococcus aureus against linezolid. None of these genes were highly abundant. Finally, we classified the ejaculates into categories according to their bacterial features and semen quality parameters and identified two categories that significantly differed for 5 semen quality traits and 13 bacterial features including the genera Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas and Rhodobacter. Our results show that boar semen contains a rich microbiome with potential pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes which may affect its reproductive performance.","Godia, M.; Ramayo-Caldas, Y.; Zingaretti, L.; Lopez, S.; Rodriguez-Gil, J.

Bacillus megaterium,132148,Ribosomal proteins could explain the phylogeny of Bacillus species,"Protein translation is a highly conserved process in biology. As participants of translation, ribosomal proteins in the large and small subunits of the ribosomes are likely to be highly conserved; thus, could they be endowed with sufficient sequence diversity to chronicle the evolutionary history of different species in the same or different genus? Using different Bacillus species as a model system, this study sought to examine if ribosomal proteins could reproduce the maximum likelihood phylogeny described by 16S rRNA of the investigated Bacillus species. Bacillus species investigated were Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacilluspumilus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis. Results revealed that ribosomal proteins could be categorized into four different groups depending on their extent in reproducing the 16S rRNA phylogeny of the different Bacillus species. The first group comprises ribosomal protein that could reproduce all the phylogenetic positions of the Bacillus species accurately. These ribosomal proteins were ribosomal protein L6, L7/12, L9, L13, L24, L32, S3, S9, S12, S15, S16, S17, and S18. Ribosomal proteins that hold partial phylogenetic significance constitutes the second group where the ribosomal proteins could reproduce the major branches of the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree but differ in the placement of one or two Bacillus species. In general, this group of ribosomal proteins had difficulty differentiating B. licheniformis and B. pumilus at the sequence level. Members of this group of ribosomal protein include ribosomal protein L22, L29, L30, L31 Type B, L33, L35, S1, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S11, S13, S19, and S20. The third group of ribosomal proteins were those which were highly conserved at the sequence level, and which could not differentiate the different Bacillus species. These ribosomal proteins were ribosomal protein L5, L36, S2, S10, and S21. Finally, there were also ribosomal proteins that randomly placed the different Bacillus species into phylogenetic positions not in sync with those depicted by the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. These ribosomal proteins were ribosomal protein L7Ae, L17, L20, L23, L27, L28, L31, L34 and S14 Type Z. Overall, members of all four groups of ribosomal proteins came from both the large and small ribosome subunits which meant that evolutionary forces exerted selective pressure on both subunits but at differing extents. Collectively, specific ribosomal proteins could reproduce the phylogeny of different Bacillus species as described by the gold standard phylogenetic marker, 16S rRNA, which highlighted that co-evolutionary processes could be at work in shaping the evolution of ribosomal proteins and rRNA in close contact with each other in the ribosome.

Significance of the work16S rRNA is the gold standard phylogenetic marker used to inform the evolutionary relationships between different species across the three domains of life. Given that 16S rRNA is nestled in the ribosomes together with a consortium of ribosomal proteins each with unique structural and enzymatic functions, could ribosomal proteins be used similarly as phylogenetic markers for informing species divergence and relationships? Specifically, as part of the highly conserved ribosome important to protein translation, do ribosomal proteins possess sufficient sequence diversity to help chronicle the evolutionary relationships between different species? By reconstructing the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of different Bacillus species, this study revealed that ribosomal proteins fall into four categories concerning their utility for informing phylogeny between different species of the same genus. Specifically, there existed ribosomal proteins able to accurately reproduce the phylogenetic tree described by 16S rRNA. On the other hand, there were ribosomal proteins that hold only partial phylogenetic significance where they could reproduce the major branches of the reference phylogenetic tree but differ in the placement of one or two species along the tree. Besides the above two categories, they were also ribosomal proteins whose sequence diversity was not sufficient to help differentiate between different Bacillus species. Finally, another class of ribosomal proteins did not chronicle the evolutionary trajectories of the different species resulting in phylogenetic tree with random placement of the different species. Overall, evolutionary forces likely exerted different selection forces on different ribosome subunits as well as individual ribosomal protein that resulted in the differentiation of their utility as phylogenetic markers of different species of the same genus. Co-evolution between ribosomal proteins as well as between ribosomal proteins and rRNA might underpin part of the evolutionary history chronicled by individual ribosomal proteins, thereby, endowing them with phylogenetic significance.

HighlightsO_LIRibosomal proteins were found to be useful in describing the phylogeny of different Bacillus species compared to the gold standard phylogenetic marker, 16S rRNA.
C_LIO_LIBy examining the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree reconstructed, ribosomal proteins could be categorized into four groups with differing phylogenetic significance.
C_LIO_LIThe first group comprises ribosomal proteins able to accurately reproduce all the phylogenetic positions of different Bacillus species relative to 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree. This group include ribosomal protein L6, L7/12, L9, L13, L24, L32, S3, S9, S12, S15, S16, S17, and S18.
C_LIO_LIThe second group refers to ribosomal proteins able to reproduce the major branches of the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree but lacks in the correct placement of one or two Bacillus species. These ribosomal proteins were L22, L29, L30, L31 Type B, L33, L35, SI, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, Sll, S13, S19, and S20.

Bacillus megaterium,132414,"Biological control of chili damping off disease, caused by Pythium myriotylum","Pythium myriotylum is a notorious soil-borne oomycete causes post-emergence damping off in chilli pepper. Of various disease management strategies, utilization of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in disease suppression and plant growth promotion is eye catching strategy. The present study was performed to isolate and characterize PGPR indigenous to chili rhizosphere in Pakistan, and to test their potential to suppress damping off and plant growth promotion in chilli. Out of total 28 antagonists, 8 bacterial isolates (4a2, JHL-8, JHL-12, 1C2, RH-24, 1D, 5C and RH-87) significantly suppressed the colony growth of P. myriotylum in dual culture experiment. All the tested bacterial isolates were characterized for biochemical attributes, and 16S rRNA sequence based phylogenetic analysis identified these isolates as Flavobacterium spp., Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas libanensis. All the tested bacterial isolates showed positive test results for ammonia production, starch hydrolase (except 4a2), and hydrogen cyanide production (except 4a2 and 1D). All the tested antagonists produced indole-3-acetic acid (13.4-39.0 g ml-1), solubilized inorganic phosphate (75-103 gml-1) and produced siderophores (17.1-23.7%) in vitro. All the tested bacterial isolates showed varied level of susceptibility and resistance response against different antibiotics and all these bacterial isolates were found non-pathogenic to chill seeds and notably enhanced percentage seed germination, plumule, redical length and vigor index over un-inoculated control. Additionally, under pathogen pressure, bacterization increased the defense related enzymes (PO, PPO and PAL) activates. Moreover, chilli seeds treatment with these bacterial isolates significantly suppressed damping-off caused by P. myriotylum, and improved PGP traits as compared to control. In addition, a positive correlation was noticed between shoot, root length and dry shoot and root weigh and a negative correlation was seen between dry shoot, root weight and seedling percentage mortality. These results showed that native PGPR possess multiple traits beneficial to the chilli plants and can be used to develop eco-friendly and effective seed treatment formulation as an alternative to synthetic chemical fungicides.","Hyder, S.; Gondal, A.

Bacillus megaterium,176975,Display of the self-sufficient CYP102A1 on the surface of E. coli-derived Outer Membrane Vesicles,"The cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase superfamily offers the unique ability to catalyze regio-and stereospecifical oxidation of a non-activated C-H bond. CYPs found applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and drug metabolites as well as in bioremediation. They are typically used in whole-cell bioconversion processes, due to their low stability and the need for a redox partner and cofactor. Unfortunately, substrate uptake and/or product transport limitations are frequently encountered and side reactions occur due to other enzymes in the cellular environment. Here, we present a proof-of-principle of a novel cell-free cytochrome P-450 nanocatalyst based on surface display on bacterial outer membrane vesicles. The self-sufficient CYP 102A1 from Bacillus megaterium was engineered to be translocated on the outer membrane vesicles of Escherichia coli. The resulting vesicles can simply be isolated from the culture supernatant. Moreover, no expensive and elaborate enzyme purification is required. This approach shows great promise as an alternative strategy to recombinantly produce CYP enzymes for a variety of applications, such as in fine chemical production and in the development of biosensors.","Devriese, D.; Surmont, P.; Lynen, F.; Devreese, B.",2021-06-03,Bioengineering,10.1101/2021.06.02.446438,1,Bart  Devreese,Ghent University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.02.446438v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.02.446438v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Bacillus megaterium,216371,"Housekeeping gene gyrA, a potential molecular marker for Bacillus ecology study","Bacillus is a ubiquitous microorganism and is one of the most commercially important species widely used in industry, agriculture and healthcare. Bacillus is relatively well understood at the single-cell level; however, molecular tools that determine diversity and ecology of Bacillus community are limited, which limits our understanding of how the Bacillus community works. In the present study, we investigated the potential of the housekeeping gene gyrA as a molecular marker for determining the diversity of Bacillus species. The amplification efficiency for Bacillus species diversity could be greatly improved by primer design. Therefore, we designed a novel primer pair gyrA3 that can detect at least 92 Bacillus species and related species. For Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus megaterium, we observed that the high variability of the gyrA gene allows for more detailed clustering at the subspecies level that cannot be achieved by the 16S rRNA gene. Since gyrA provides better phylogenetic resolution than 16S rRNA and informs on the diversity of the Bacillus community, we propose that gyrA gene may have broad application prospects in the study of Bacillus ecology.","Liu, Y.; Stefanic, P.; Miao, Y.; Xue, Y.; Xun, W.; Shen, Q.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, R.; Mulec, I.

New L-Asp-L-Asn (DN) extracted from Bacillus megaterium inhibited the growth of A. flavus had been elucidated in our laboratory. The genes encoding DN and binuclear zinc finger cluster protein of AflR were fused, then fusion protein could compete with the AflS-AflR complex for the AflR binding site and significantly improve anti-A. flavus activity of DN. The fusion gene dn-aflR was cloned into pET32a and recombinant plasmid was introduced into Escherichia coli BL21. The highest expression was observed after 10 h induction and purified by affinity chromatography column. Compared with DN, the novel fusion protein DN-AflR significantly inhibited the growth of A. flavus and biosynthesis of aflatoxin B1. This study promoted the use of competitive inhibition of fusion proteins to reduce the expression of regulatory genes in the biosynthetic pathway of aflatoxin.

Bacillus megaterium,42130,"Isolation, Development, and Genomic Analysis of Bacillus megaterium SR7 for Growth and Metabolite Production Under Supercritical Carbon Dioxide","Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) is an attractive substitute for conventional organic solvents due to its unique transport and thermodynamic properties, its renewability and labile nature, and its high solubility for compounds such as alcohols, ketones and aldehydes. However, biological systems that use scCO2 are mainly limited to in vitro processes due to its strong inhibition of cell viability and growth. To solve this problem, we used a bioprospecting approach to isolate a microbial strain with the natural ability to grow while exposed to scCO2. Enrichment culture and serial passaging of deep subsurface fluids from the McElmo Dome scCO2 reservoir in aqueous media under scCO2 headspace enabled the isolation of spore-forming strain Bacillus megaterium SR7. Sequencing and analysis of the complete 5.51 Mbp genome and physiological characterization revealed the capacity for facultative anaerobic metabolism, including fermentative growth on a diverse range of organic substrates. Supplementation of growth medium with O_SCPCAPLC_SCPCAP-alanine for chemical induction of spore germination significantly improved growth frequencies and biomass accumulation under scCO2 headspace. Detection of endogenous fermentative compounds in cultures grown under scCO2 represents the first observation of bioproduct generation and accumulation under this condition.

Bacillus megaterium,58786,Performance evaluation of biosurfactant stabilized microbubbles in enhanced oil recovery,"Microbubble technology is increasingly finding applications in biomedical engineering, soil remediation and wastewater treatment. Recently, the use of surfactant microbubbles has been studied as an alternate to aqueous solution in pollutant remediation since they have the advantage of improving the contact with the contaminant due to their surface properties. In this research endeavor, the application potential of microbubble suspension generated using a lipopeptide biosurfactant produced by a marine strain of Bacillus megaterium in tertiary oil recovery was investigated. The microbubbles were generated using a high speed homogenizer and their properties such as stability and size distribution were studied. The microbubble suspension was used as flooding agent to recover gear oil from an artificially saturated sand packed column. The performance of microbubbles in tertiary oil recovery was compared with that of aqueous biosurfactant solution. It was found that microbubble suspension generated using biosurfactant had higher oil recovery efficiency (46%) than aqueous solution (36%).\n\nMoreover, the pressure buildup across the sand packed column was fairly low while using microbubble suspension. The increased oil recovery using microbubbles can be attributed to their effective permeation through the pores of sand packed column and closer contact between biosurfactant molecules and oil. Thus, the results obtained in this study convincingly indicate that biosurfactant stabilized microbubble suspension, due to its higher performance and lower injection pressure requirement, can serve as a potentially efficient flooding agent for tertiary oil recovery.","Dhanarajana, G.; Perveen, S.; Roy, A.; De, S.; Sen, R.",2018-12-21,Bioengineering,10.1101/504431,1,Shaheen  Perveen,"Department of Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, West Bengal, 721302, India",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/504431v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/504431v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Bacillus megaterium,59726,Time- and size-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics in highly polluted air: new clues for haze formation mechanism,"Aerosol chemistry is often studied without considering microbial involvements. Here, we have applied a high-volume (1 m3/min) aerosol sampler and the Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor (NanoMoudi) along with molecular and microscopic methods to investigate time-and size-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics in air. Under high particulate matter (PM) polluted episodes, bacterial aerosols were detected to have a viability up to 50-70% in the 0.56-1 m size range, at which elevated levels of SO42-, NO3- and NH4+ were concurrently observed. Engineered or acclimated for both pharmaceuticals and wastewater treatment, bacteria such as Psychrobacter spp., Massilia spp., Acinetobacter lwoffii, Exiguobacterium aurantiacum, and Bacillus megaterium were shown to have experienced massive abundance shifts in polluted air on early mornings and late afternoons, on which were previously reported to witness rapid new particle formation events. For example, Acinetobacter spp. were shown to account for > 96% abundance at a corresponding PM2.5 level of 208 ng/m3. The bacterial aerosol changes corresponded to the observed PM2.5 mass peak shift from 3.2-5.6 m to the high viability size range of 0.56-1m. Additionally, it is interesting that elevated levels of soluble Na, Ca, Mg, K, Al, Fe and P elements that are required for bacterial growth were observed to co-occur with those significant bacterial aerosol structure shifts in the air. For particular time-resolved PM2.5 pollution episodes, Acinetobacter and Massilia were shown to alternate in dominating the time-resolved aerosol community structures. The results from a HYSPLIT trajectory model simulation suggested that the role by air mass transport in affecting the observed bacterial aerosol dynamics could be minor. As an evidence, we found that Acinetobacter, Psychrobacter, Exiguobacterium, and Bacillus genera were emitted into the air with a level of > 3000 CFU/m3 from a pharmaceutical plant. In addition, high level of VOCs up to 15,030 ppbv, mainly Acetone (61%) and Acetaldehyde (11%), were also detected in the air inside the plant. All the data including size-resolved viability and time-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics together with their growth conditions detected in the air suggested that airborne bacteria in the size range of 0.56- 1m could have played important roles for haze formation in Beijing. The results about time- and size-resolved bacterial aerosol dynamics from this work provide a fresh understanding of aerosol chemistry especially in highly polluted air. It is hoped that these findings could lend a support in future cost-effective air pollution control practices.","Zhang, T.; Li, X.; Wang, M.; Chen, H.; Yao, M.",2019-01-07,Microbiology,10.1101/513093,1,Maosheng  Yao,Peking University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513093v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513093v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Bacillus megaterium,86998,Enhancement of drought tolerance on guinea grass by dry alginate macrobeads as inoculant of Bacillus strains,"Drought is responsible for almost 70% of total crop damage in tropical and subtropical countries. In the Colombian Caribbean, drought has caused low availability of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) in forage amount and quality, generating increase in production costs in livestock systems. In this study, we aimed at designing and evaluating dry macro-polymeric inoculants of Bacillus strains and used them successfully to mitigate drought effect on Guinea grass (M. maximus). We chose Bacillus sp XT13 and Bacillus megaterium XT14 strains, previously selected for their capacity to mitigate drought stress on Guinea grass. For the inoculant formulation process, a concentration of 3.2% alginate was used for both microorganisms, selecting the polymer-bacterium ratio of 70:30 for XT13 and 80:20 for XT14. The results of the experiments in greenhouse showed that drought had a negative effect on Guinea grass growth, but the PGPB application with or without macro-polymeric dry matrix improved plant growth significantly. We also observed that co-inoculation of the strains generated a greater beneficial effect than individual inoculation. Interestingly, co-inoculation of XT13 and XT14 under the dry macro-polymeric formulation increased biomass production of the aerial part (7.32%), root biomass, (25.3%), nutritional quality parameters, such as digestibility (3.32%), protein (20.3%); proline accumulation increased (21.06%) and both neutral digestible fiber (2.43%) and APX antioxidant activity (24.2%) decreased with respect to co-inoculation of both bacteria without formulation. These findings have shown that dry macrobeads immobilization has a significantly positive influence on the capacity of XT13 and XT14 bacterial strains to induce drought stress tolerance in Guinea grass.","Mendoza, J.",2019-09-08,Microbiology,10.1101/761056,1,Jonathan  Mendoza,Agrosavia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/761056v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/761056v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Bacillus megaterium,97382,Construction of an inducible amyloid expression circuit in Bacillus megaterium: A case study with CsgA and TasA,"Environmental applications of synthetic biology such as water remediation require engineered strains to function robustly in a fluctuating and potentially hostile environment. The construction of synthetic biofilm formation circuits could potentially alleviate this issue by promoting cell survival. Towards this end, we construct a xylose-inducible system for the expression of the functional amyloids CsgA and TasA in the soil bacterium Bacillus megaterium. We find that although both amyloids are expressed, only TasA is successfully exported from the cells. Furthermore, expression of CsgA results in a significant growth penalty for the cells while expression of TasA does not. Finally, we show that TasA expression conveys a small but detectable increase in cells adhesion to nickel beads. These results suggest that TasA is a promising candidate for future work on synthetic biofilm formation in B. megaterium.","Larsson, E. M.; Mcmanus, J. B.; Murray, R.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,9717,"Functional analysis of a biosynthetic cluster essential for production of 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine, a germination-arrest factor from Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6","Rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6 produces the germination-arrest factor, 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG). FVG has previously been shown to both arrest the germination of weedy grasses and to inhibit the growth of the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Very little is known about the mechanism by which FVG is produced. Although a previous study identified a region of the genome that may be involved in FVG biosynthesis, it has not yet been determined which genes within that region are sufficient and necessary for FVG production. In the current study, we explored the role of each of the putative genes encoded in that region by constructing deletion mutations. Mutant strains were assayed for their ability to produce FVG with a combination of biological assays and thin-layer chromatographic analyses. This work defined the core FVG biosynthetic gene cluster and revealed several interesting characteristics of FVG production. We determined that FVG biosynthesis requires two small open reading frames of less than 150 nucleotides and that multiple transporters have overlapping but distinct functionality. In addition, two genes in the center of the biosynthetic gene cluster are not required for FVG production, suggesting that additional products may be produced from the cluster. Transcriptional analysis indicated that at least three active promoters play a role in the expression of genes within this cluster.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,11054,Adaptive evolution by spontaneous domain fusion and protein relocalisation,"Knowledge of adaptive processes encompasses understanding of the emergence of new genes. Computational analyses of genomes suggest that new genes can arise by domain swapping, however, empirical evidence has been lacking. Here we describe a set of nine independent deletion mutations that arose during the course of selection experiments with the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in which the membrane-spanning domain of a fatty acid desaturase became translationally fused to a cytosolic di-guanylate cyclase (DGC) generating an adaptive phenotype. Detailed genetic analysis of one chimeric fusion protein showed that the DGC domain had become membrane-localised resulting in a new biological function. The relative ease by which this new gene arose along with its profound functional and regulatory effects provides a glimpse of mutational events and their consequences that are likely to play a significant role in the evolution of new genes.","Farr, A.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,24124,A Multimodal Strategy Used By A Large c-di-GMP Network,"The Pseudomonas fluorescens genome encodes for 50+ proteins involved in -di-GMP signaling. Here, we demonstrate that when tested across 188 nutrients, these enzymes and effectors appear capable of impacting biofilm formation. Transcriptional analysis of network members across [~]50 nutrient conditions indicates that altered gene expression can explain a subset, but not all, of biofilm-formation responses to the nutrients. Additional organization of the network is likely achieved through physical interaction, as determined via probing [~]2000 interactions by bacterial two-hybrid assays. Our analysis revealed a multimodal regulatory strategy, using combinations of ligand-mediated signals, protein-protein interaction and/or transcriptional regulation to further fine-tune c-di-GMP-mediated responses. These results create a profile of a large c-di-GMP network that is used to make important cellular decisions, opening the door to future model building and the ability to engineer this complex circuitry in other bacteria.\n\nAbstract ImportanceCyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a key signalling molecule regulating bacterial biofilm formation, and many microbes have up to dozens of proteins that make, break or bind this dinucleotide. Thus, a major open question in the field is how signalling specificity is conferred in this context with a soluble signalling molecule. Here, we take a systems approach, using mutational analysis, transcriptional studies and bacterial two-hybrid analysis to interrogate this network. We find that the network typically combines two or more modes of regulation (i.e., transcriptional control with protein-protein interaction) to generate an observed output.","Dahlstrom, K.; Collins, A.; Doing, G.; Taroni, J.; Gauvin, T.; Greene, C.; Hogan, D.; O'toole, G.",2017-10-04,Microbiology,10.1101/198481,1,George  O'toole,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/198481v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/198481v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/JB.00703-17
Pseudomonas fluorescens,24230,Cell surface associated LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens is anchored inside its Type-1 Secretion TolC-like Pore,"The type-1 secretion system (T1SS) of gram-negative bacteria enables a one-step translocation strategy known to move functionally diverse proteins from the cytoplasm into the extracellular environment without a periplasmic intermediate. LapA of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 is a giant type-1 secreted (T1S) adhesin that facilitates biofilm formation only when displayed at the cell surface. A LapA-targeting periplasmic protease, LapG, connects intracellular cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels with cell surface-associated LapA by cleaving and absolving LapA from the cell surface under conditions unsuitable for biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that LapA contains a novel N-terminal element, called the retention module (RM), which prohibits classical one-step T1S of LapA. We provide evidence that the RM of LapA tethers LapA at the cell surface through its outer membrane TolC-like pore, LapE, where LapA is accessible to the periplasmic protease LapG. We also demonstrate that this unusual retention strategy is likely conserved among LapA-like proteins and represents a new subclass of T1SS ABC transporters exclusively involved in transporting LapA-like adhesins.\n\nSignificance StatementBacteria have evolved multiple secretion strategies to interact with their environment. For many bacteria, the secretion of cell surface associated adhesins is often key for initiating contact with a preferred substrate to facilitate biofilm formation. Our work demonstrates that P. fluorescens uses a previously unrecognized secretion strategy to retain the giant adhesin LapA at its cell surface. Further, we identify likely LapA-like adhesins in various pathogenic and commensal Proteobacteria and provide phylogenetic evidence these adhesins are secreted by a new subclass of T1SS ABC transporters.","Smith, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,99674,"Relationships between community composition, productivity and invasion resistance in semi-natural bacterial microcosms","Experiments with artificial communities have suggested that invasion resistance in microbial communities is often a side-effect of community members contribution towards overall community productivity (broadly defined as cumulative cell density and/or growth rate). However, few experiments have investigated this in natural microbial communities. We conducted experimental invasions of two bacterial species (Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida) into laboratory microcosms inoculated with 680 different mixtures of bacteria derived from naturally-occurring microbial communities collected in the field. Using 16S amplicon sequencing to characterise microcosm starting composition, and high-throughput assays of community phenotypes including productivity and invader survival, we determined that productivity is a key predictor of invasion resistance in natural microbial communities, substantially mediating the effect of composition on invasion resistance. The results suggest that similar general principles govern invasion in artificial and natural communities, and that factors affecting resident community productivity should be a focal point for future microbial invasion experiments.","Jones, M.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,106223,Second messenger control of mRNA translation by dynamic ribosome modification,"Control of mRNA translation is a crucial regulatory mechanism used by bacteria to respond to their environment. In the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, RimK modifies the C-terminus of ribosomal protein RpsF to influence important aspects of rhizosphere colonisation through proteome remodelling. In this study, we show that RimK activity is itself under complex, multifactorial control by the co-transcribed phosphodiesterase trigger enzyme (RimA) and a polyglutamate-specific protease (RimB). Furthermore, biochemical experimentation and mathematical modelling reveal a role for the nucleotide second messenger cyclic-di-GMP in coordinating these activities. Active ribosome regulation by RimK occurs by two main routes: indirectly, through changes in the abundance of the global translational regulator Hfq and directly, with translation of surface attachment factors, amino acid transporters and key secreted molecules linked specifically to RpsF modification. Our findings show that post-translational ribosomal modification functions as a rapid-response mechanism that tunes global gene translation in response to environmental signals.","Grenga, L.; Little, R.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,108768,Experimental evolution of nascent multicellularity: Recognizing a Darwinian transition in individuality,"Major evolutionary transitions in individuality, at any level of the biological hierarchy, occur when groups participate in Darwinian processes as units of selection in their own right. Identifying transitions in individuality can be problematic because apparent selection at one level of the biological hierarchy may be a by-product of selection occurring at another level. Here we discuss approaches to this ""levels-of-selection"" problem and apply them to a previously published experimental exploration of the evolutionary transition to multicellularity. In these experiments groups of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens were required to reproduce via life cycles involving soma- and germline-like phases. The rate of transition between the two cell types was a focus of selection, and might be regarded as a property of groups, cells, or even genes. By examining the experimental data under several established philosophical frameworks, we argue that in the Pseudomonas experiments, bacterial groups acquired Darwinian properties sufficient to allow the evolution of traits adaptive at the group level.","Rose, C.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,109637,"The birth of a bacterial tRNA gene by large-scale, tandem duplication events","Organisms differ in the types and numbers of tRNA genes that they carry. While the evolutionary mechanisms behind tRNA gene set evolution have been investigated theoretically and computationally, direct observations of tRNA gene set evolution remain rare. Here, we report the evolution of a tRNA gene set in laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25. The growth defect caused by deleting the single-copy tRNA gene, serCGA, is rapidly compensated by large-scale (45-290 kb) duplications in the chromosome. Each duplication encompasses a second, compensatory tRNA gene (serTGA) and is associated with a rise in tRNA-Ser(UGA) in the mature tRNA pool. We postulate that tRNA-Ser(CGA) elimination increases the translational demand for tRNA-Ser(UGA), a pressure relieved by increasing serTGA copy number. This work demonstrates that tRNA gene sets can evolve through duplication of existing tRNA genes, a phenomenon that may contribute to the presence of multiple, identical tRNA gene copies within genomes.","Ayan, G.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,119259,"MapA, a second large RTX adhesin, contributes to biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens","Mechanisms by which cells attach to a surface and form a biofilm are diverse and differ greatly between organisms. The Gram-negative, Gammaproteobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens attaches to a surface through the localization of the large type 1-secreted RTX adhesin LapA to the outer surface of the cell. LapA localization to the cell surface is controlled by the activities of a periplasmic protease, LapG and an inner-membrane spanning cyclic di-GMP responsive effector protein, LapD. A previous study identified a second, LapA-like protein encoded in the P. fluorescens Pf0-1 genome: Pfl01_1463. However, deletion of this gene had no discernible phenotype under our standard laboratory growth conditions. Here, we identified specific growth conditions wherein, Pfl01_1463, hereafter called MapA (Medium Adhesion Protein A) is a functional adhesin contributing to biofilm formation. This adhesin, like LapA, appears to be secreted through a Lap-related type 1 secretion machinery. We show MapA involvement in biofilm formation is also controlled by LapD and LapG, and that the differing roles of LapA and MapA in biofilm formation are achieved, at least in part, through the differences in the sequences of the two adhesins and their differential, cyclic di-GMP-dependent transcriptional regulation. This differential regulation appears to lead to different distributions of the expression of lapA and mapA within a biofilm. Our data indicate that the mechanisms by which a cell forms a biofilm and the components of a biofilm matrix can differ depending on growth conditions in the biofilm.

ImportanceAdhesins are critical for the formation and maturation of bacterial biofilms. We identify a second adhesin in P. fluorescens, called MapA, which appears to play a role in biofilm maturation and whose regulation is distinct from the previously reported LapA adhesin, which is critical for biofilm initiation. Analysis of bacterial adhesins show that LapA-like and MapA-like adhesins are found broadly in Pseudomonads and related organisms, indicating that the utilization of different suites of adhesins may be broadly important in the Gammaproteobacteria.","Collins, A.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,120934,Field evaluation of biocontrol agents against black-foot and Petri diseases of grapevine,"BACKGROUNDBlack-foot and Petri diseases are the main fungal diseases associated with young grapevine decline. Two field experiments were established to evaluate the preventive effect of two potential biocontrol agents (BCAs), i.e. Streptomyces sp. E1 + R4 and Pythium oligandrum Po37, and three BCA-commercial products containing Trichoderma atroviride SC1, Trichoderma koningii TK7 and Pseudomonas fluorescens+Bacillus atrophaeus on fungal infection in grafted plants and plant growth parameters.

RESULTSThe effectiveness of some BCA in reducing the incidence and severity of both diseases was dependent on the plant part analyzed and the plant age. No single BCA application was able to control both diseases. Streptomyces sp. E1+R4 were able to reduce significantly black-foot disease infection while P. oligandrum Po37 and Trichoderma spp. were able to reduce significantly Petri disease infection. BCA treatments had no effect on the shoot weight, and root weight was significantly lower in all BCA treatments with respect to the control.

CONCLUSIONSThe combination of the disease-suppressive activity of two or more beneficial microbes in a biocontrol preparation is required to prevent infection by black-foot and Petri disease fungi in vineyards.","Martinez-Diz, M.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,128594,In-vitro evaluation of Pseudomonas fluorescens antibacterial activity against Listeria spp. isolated from New Zealand horticultural environments,"Beneficial bacteria with antibacterial properties are an attractive alternative to chemical-based antibacterial or bactericidal agents. The aim of our study was to source such bacteria from horticultural produce and environments and to explore the mechanisms of their antimicrobial properties. Four strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens were isolated that possessed antibacterial activity against the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. These strains (PFR46H06, PFR46H07, PFR46H08 and PFR46H09) were tested against L. monocytogenes (n=31), L. seeligeri (n=1) and L. innocua (n=1) isolated from seafood and horticultural sources, and two L. monocytogenes from clinical cases (Scott A and ATCC 49594, n=2). All Listeria strains were inhibited by the three strains PFR46H07, PFR46H08 and PFR46H09 with average zones of inhibition of 14.8, 15.1 and 18.2 mm, respectively, with PFR46H09 having significantly more inhibition than the other two (p<0.05). PFR46H06 showed minimal inhibition towards the L. seeligeri and L. innocua isolates and no inhibition towards most of the L. monocytogenes isolates. In order to investigate the functional protein differences between these strains, all four strains were subjected to whole cell lysate proteomics; data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019965. We found significant differences in the peptide profiles and protein summaries between these isolates. The total number of proteins identified was 1781 in PFR46H06, 2030 in PFR46H07, 2228 in PFR46H08 and 1994 in PFR46H09. We paid special attention to secretion system proteins as these play a main role in the defense mechanisms of bacteria, particularly those of the type VI secretion system (T6SS) and found that they varied significantly (p<0.001) among the four isolates. PFR46H06 and PFR46H07 possessed the fewest secretion system structural proteins (12 and 11 respectively) while PFR46H08 and PFR46H09 each had 18. PFR46H09, which showed the greatest antimicrobial effect, had nine T6SS proteins compared to just four in the other three strains.","Mohan, V.; Fletcher, G.; Leroi, F.",2020-07-03,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.07.03.183277,1,Vathsala  Mohan,Plant and Food Research,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.183277v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.03.183277v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,131912,Protective Plant Immune Responses are Elicited by Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles,"Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) perform a variety of functions in bacterial survival and virulence. In mammalian systems, OMVs activate immune responses and have been exploited as vaccines. However, little work has focused on the role that OMVs play during interactions with plant hosts. Here we report that OMVs from the pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae and the beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens activate plant immune responses that protect against bacterial and oomycete pathogens. OMVs from these two species display different sensitivity to biochemical stressors, which could indicate differences in OMV cargo packaging. Furthermore, our study shows that OMV-induced protective immune responses are T3SS- and protein-independent, while OMV-mediated seedling growth inhibition largely depends on protein cargo. Importantly, OMV-mediated plant responses are distinct from those triggered by PAMP/MAMPs or effector molecules alone. OMVs provide a unique opportunity to study virulence factors in combination and add a new layer of interaction and complexity to host-microbe interactions.","Mcmillan, H. M.; Zebell, S.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,132156,"Bioremediation Potential of Select Bacterial Species for the Neonicotinoid Insecticides, Thiamethoxam and Imidacloprid","The neonicotinoid insecticides, including thiamethoxam (THM) and imidacloprid (IMI), have become increasingly favored in the past decade due to their specificity as insect neurotoxicants. However, neonicotinoids have been implicated as a potential contributing factor in Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the widespread disappearance of honey bees, which affects produce production on a global scale. The environmental persistence of neonicotinoids underscores the importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-friendly remediation technique to remove residual insecticides from the environment. The present study characterizes the neonicotinoid bioremediation potential of six bacterial species: Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus lactis. In Phase I, we evaluated the utilization of IMI or THM as the sole carbon or nitrogen source by P. fluorescens, P. putida, and P. aeruginosa. All three species were better able to utilize THM over IMI as their sole carbon or nitrogen source, and better growth was noted when THM was used as the sole nitrogen source compared to the sole carbon source. Thus, further studies proceeded with THM only. In Phase II, we assessed the kinetics of THM removal from aqueous media by the six species. Significant (p<0.0001) reductions in 70 mg/L THM concentration were observed for P. fluorescens (67%), P. putida (65%), P. aeruginosa (52%), and A. faecalis (39%) over the 24-day study period, and for E. coli (60%) and S. lactis (12%) over the 14-day study period. The amount of time required to remove 50% of the THM in the media (T50) was: 12 days (d) (E. coli), 18 d (P. fluorescens), 19 d (P. putida), and 23 d (P. aeruginosa). Neither A. faecalis nor S. lactis achieved 50% removal during the study periods. The THM removal by all species followed a first-order kinetic reaction and half-lives were calculated accordingly. HPLC chromatograms of P. fluorescens, P. putida, and E. coli cultures revealed that as the area of the THM peak decreased over time, the area of an unidentified metabolite peak increased. In Phase II, we sought to characterize this metabolite and the overall metabolic efficiency of these three species. Maximal THM removal occurred at 30{degrees}C for all bacterial species assessed. Identification of the metabolite is currently underway, which will allow determination of whether the metabolite is less toxic than the parent compound, a prerequisite for this remediation technique to be viable. If the metabolite is found to be less hazardous than THM, further testing will follow to evaluate the use of this bioremediation technique in the field.","Zamule, S.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,135506,Host auxin machinery is important in mediating root architecture changes induced by Pseudomonas fluorescens GM30 and Serendipita indica,"Auxin is a key phytohormone that is integral to plant developmental processes including those underlying root initiation, elongation, and branching. Beneficial microbes have been shown to have an impact on root development, potentially mediated through auxin. In this study, we explore the role of host auxin signaling and transport components in mediating the root growth promoting effects of beneficial microbes. Towards this end, we undertook co-culture studies of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with microbes previously reported to promote lateral root proliferation and produce auxin. Two types of beneficial microbes were included in the present study; a plant growth promoting bacterial species of interest, Pseudomonas fluorescens GM30, and a well-studied plant growth promoting fungal species, Serendipita indica (Piriformospora indica). Following co-culture, lateral root production was found restored in auxin transport inhibitor-treated plants, suggesting involvement of microbe and/or microbially-produced auxin in altering plant auxin levels. In order to clarify the role of host auxin signaling and transport pathways in mediating interactions with bacterial and fungal species, we employed a suite of auxin genetic mutants as hosts in co-culture screens. Our result show that the transport proteins PIN2, PIN3, and PIN7 and the signaling protein ARF19, are required for mediating root architecture effects by the bacterial and/or fungal species. Mutants corresponding to these proteins did not significantly respond to co-culture treatment and did not show increases in lateral root production and lateral root density.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,146436,Loss of a plant receptor kinase recruits beneficial rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas,"Maintaining microbiome structure is critical for the health of both plants1 and animals2. In plants, enrichment of beneficial bacteria is associated with advantageous outcomes including protection from biotic and abiotic stress3,4. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which plants enrich for specific beneficial microbes without general dysbiosis have remained elusive. Here we show that through regulation of NADPH oxidase, FERONIA kinase negatively regulates beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens in the Arabidopsis rhizosphere microbiome. By rescreening a collection of Arabidopsis mutants that affect root immunity under gnotobiotic conditions, followed by microbiome sequencing in natural soil, we identified a FERONIA mutant (fer-8) with a rhizosphere microbiome enriched in P. fluorescens without phylum-level dysbiosis. Using microbiome transplant experiments, we found that the fer-8 microbiome was beneficial and promoted plant growth. The effect of FER on rhizosphere Pseudomonads was independent of its immune coreceptor function, role in development, and jasmonic acid autoimmunity. We found that the fer-8 mutant has reduced basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots and that mutants deficient in NADPH oxidase showed elevated rhizosphere Pseudomonad levels. Overexpression of the ROP2 gene (encoding a client of FER and positive regulator of NADPH oxidase5) in fer-8 plants suppressed Pseudomonad overgrowth. This work shows that FER-mediated ROS production regulates levels of beneficial Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere microbiome.","Song, Y.; Wilson, A.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,149655,Specific quorum sensing molecules are possibly associated with responses to herbicide toxicity in a Pseudomonas strain,"Pesticides contribute to pest control and increased agricultural production; however, they are toxic to non-target organisms and they contaminate the environment. The exposure of bacteria to these substances can lead to the need for physiological and structural changes for survival, which can be determined by genes whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing (QS). However, it is not yet clear whether these processes can be induced by herbicides. Thus, the aim of this work was to determine whether there is a QS response system in a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain that is modulated by herbicides. This strain was isolated from water storage tanks used for washing pesticide packaging and was tested against herbicides containing saflufenacil, glyphosate, sulfentrazone, 2,4-D, and dicamba as active molecules. We found that this strain possibly uses QS signaling molecules to control the production of reactive oxygen species, whether those produced by the bacteriums energy generating system or by molecules induced by the presence of saflufenacil and glyphosate. This strain used other signaling molecules for various stages of biofilm formation in the presence of herbicides containing sulfentrazone, 2,4-D, and dicamba. These findings, as an initial screening which will guide new studies, suggest that this strain has a flexibility in gene expression that allows survival in the presence of several stress-inducing molecules, regardless of previous exposure. This represents a model of metabolic and physiological plasticity. Biofilms made up of several bacterial species can use this model in agricultural environments, increasing the potential for degradation of xenobiotics, but with impacts on diversity and functionality of microbiotas in these environments.","Pileggi, M.; Freitas, P.; Rovida, A.; Silva, C.; Pileggi, S.; Olchanheski, L.",2020-11-24,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.24.395699,1,Marcos  Pileggi,Universidade Estadual de Ponta Grossa,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.395699v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.395699v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.envpol.2021.117896
Pseudomonas fluorescens,154892,A mutational hotspot that determines highly repeatable evolution can be built and broken by silent genetic changes,"Mutational hotspots can determine evolutionary outcomes and make evolution repeatable. Hotspots are products of multiple evolutionary forces including mutation rate heterogeneity, but this variable is often hard to identify. In this work we reveal that a powerfully deterministic genetic hotspot can be built and broken by a handful of silent mutations. We observed this when studying homologous immotile variants of the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, AR2 and Pf0-2x. AR2 resurrects motility through highly repeatable de novo mutation of the same nucleotide in >95% lines in minimal media (ntrB A289C). Pf0-2x, however, evolves via a number of mutations meaning the two strains diverge significantly during adaptation. We determined that this evolutionary disparity was owed to just 6 synonymous variations within the ntrB locus, which we demonstrated by swapping the sites and observing that we were able to both break (>95% to 0% in AR2) and build (0% to 80% in Pf0-2x) a powerfully deterministic mutational hotspot. Our work reveals a fundamental role for silent genetic variation in determining adaptive outcomes.","Horton, J. S.; Flanagan, L. M.; Jackson, R. W.; Priest, N. K.; Taylor, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,155676,The effect of root exudates on the transcriptome of rhizosphere Pseudomonas spp.,"Plants live in association with microorganisms that positively influence plant development, vigor, and fitness in response to pathogens and abiotic stressors. The bulk of the plant microbiome is concentrated belowground at the plant root-soil interface. Plant roots secrete carbon-rich rhizodeposits containing primary and secondary low molecular-weight metabolites, lysates, and mucilages. These exudates provide nutrients for soil microorganisms and modulate their affinity to host plants, but molecular details of this process are largely unresolved. We addressed this gap by focusing on the molecular dialogue between eight well-characterized beneficial strains of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group and Brachypodium distachyon, a model for economically important food, feed, forage, and biomass crops of the grass family. We collected and analyzed root exudates of B. distachyon and demonstrated the presence of multiple carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids and phenolic compounds. The subsequent screening of bacteria by Biolog Phenotype MicroArrays revealed that many of these metabolites provide carbon and energy for the Pseudomonas strains. RNA-seq profiling of bacterial cultures amended with root exudates revealed changes in the expression of genes encoding numerous catabolic and anabolic enzymes, transporters, transcriptional regulators, stress response, and conserved hypothetical proteins. Almost half of the differentially expressed genes mapped to the variable part of the strains pangenome, reflecting the importance of the variable gene content in the adaptation of P. fluorescens to the rhizosphere lifestyle. Our results collectively reveal the diversity of cellular pathways and physiological responses underlying the establishment of mutualistic interactions between these beneficial rhizobacteria and their plant hosts.","Mavrodi, O.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,159998,Unexpected distribution of the 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG) biosynthetic pathway in Pseudomonas and beyond,"The biological herbicide and antibiotic 4-formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG) was originally isolated from several rhizosphere-associated strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Biosynthesis of FVG is dependent on the gvg biosynthetic gene cluster in P. fluorescens. In this investigation, we used comparative genomics to identify strains with the genetic potential to produce FVG due to presence of a gvg gene cluster. These strains primarily belong to two groups of Pseudomonas, P. fluorescens and P. syringae, however, a few strains with the gvg cluster were found outside of Pseudomonas. Mass spectrometry confirmed that all tested strains of the P. fluorescens species group produced FVG. However, P. syringae strains did not produce FVG under standard conditions. Several lines of evidence regarding the transmission of the gvg cluster including a robust phylogenetic analysis suggest that it was introduced multiple times through horizontal gene transfer within the Pseudomonas lineage as well as in select lineages of Thiomonas, Burkholderia and Pantoea. Together, these data broaden our understanding of the evolution and diversity of FVG biosynthesis. In the course of this investigation, additional gene clusters containing only a subset of the genes required to produce FVG were identified in a broad range of bacteria, including many non-pseudomonads.","Davis, E.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,169092,Plasmid fitness costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts,"Plasmids play an important role in bacterial genome evolution by transferring genes between lineages. Fitness costs associated with plasmid acquisition are expected to be a barrier to gene exchange, but the causes of plasmid fitness costs are poorly understood. Single compensatory mutations are often sufficient to completely ameliorate plasmid fitness costs, suggesting that such costs are caused by specific genetic conflicts rather than generic properties of plasmids, such as their size, metabolic burden, or expression level. Here we show -- using a combination of experimental evolution, reverse genetics, and transcriptomics -- that fitness costs of two divergent large plasmids in Pseudomonas fluorescens are caused by inducing maladaptive expression of a chromosomal tailocin toxin operon. Mutations in single genes unrelated to the toxin operon, and located on either the chromosome or the plasmid, ameliorated the disruption associated with plasmid acquisition. We identify one of these compensatory loci, the chromosomal gene PFLU4242, as the key mediator of the fitness costs of both plasmids, with the other compensatory loci either reducing expression of this gene or mitigating its deleterious effects by upregulating a putative plasmid-borne ParAB operon. The chromosomal mobile genetic element Tn6291, which uses plasmids for transmission, remained upregulated even in compensated strains, suggesting that mobile genetic elements communicate through pathways independent of general physiological disruption. Plasmid fitness costs caused by specific genetic conflicts are unlikely to act as a long-term barrier to horizontal gene transfer due to their propensity for amelioration by single compensatory mutations, explaining why plasmids are so common in bacterial genomes.","Hall, J.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,170116,4 SPECIES OF BACTERIA DETERMINISTICALLY FORM A STABLE BIOFILM IN A MILLIFLUIDIC CHANNEL: ASSEMBLY PRINCIPLES,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMultispecies microbial adherent communities are widespread in nature and organisms but the principles of their assembly and development remain unclear. Yet, the demand to understand and predict the responses of such living communities to environmental changes is increasing, calling for new approaches. Here, we test the possibility to establish a simplified but relevant model of multispecies biofilm in a laboratory setup enabling in situ real-time monitoring of the community development and control of the environmental parameters in order to decipher the mechanisms underlying the formation of the community. Using video-microscopy and species combinatorial approach, we assess the global and individual species spatiotemporal development in millifluidic channels under constant flow of nutrients. Based on quantitative measurements of expansion kinetics, local dynamics and spatial distribution, we demonstrate that the four chosen species (Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Kocuria varians and Rhodocyclus sp.) form a dynamical community that deterministically reaches its equilibrium after about 30 hours of growth. We evidence the emergence of complexity in this simplified community as reported by spatial heterogeneity rise and non-monotonic developmental kinetics. We find interspecies interactions consisting in competition for resources -- in particular oxygen -- and both direct and indirect physical interactions but no positive feedback. Thereby, we introduce a model of multispecies adherent community where effective couplings result from individual species quest for fitness optimization in a moving and heterogenous environment. This control and the understanding of this simplified experimental model shall open new avenues to apprehend adherent bacterial communities behavior in a context of rapid global change.","Monmeyran, A.; Benyoussef, W.; Thomen, P.; Dahmane, N.; Baliarda, A.; Jules, M.; Aymeric, S.; Henry, N.",2021-04-16,Biophysics,10.1101/2021.04.16.440159,1,Nelly  Henry,"Sorbonne Universite, CNRS, Laboratoire Jean Perrin (UMR 8237), 4 place Jussieu, F-75005 Paris, France",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.16.440159v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.16.440159v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,182253,Protozoan predation drives adaptive divergence in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25; ecology meets experimental evolution.,"Protozoan predators can affect the structure of bacterial communities, but investigations of how predation might influence bacterial evolution and antagonistic behaviours are scarce. Here, we performed a 20-day predator-prey evolution experiment on solid media to investigate the effect of continuous protozoan predation on bacterial traits using Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 as prey and Naegleria gruberi as an amoeboid predator. We observed the divergence of colony morphotypes coincident with an increase in bacterial grazing resistance and relative prey fitness in selected bacterial isolates. When subjected to these resistant prey, N. gruberi show reduced activity (increased encystment) and limited replication. An investigation of the mutations responsible for predation resistance reveals mutations in wspF and amrZ genes, affecting biofilm formation and motility. The bacterial mutants in the wspF gene successfully colonise the air-liquid interface and produce robust cellulose biofilms that prevent predation. The mutation in the amrZ mutant withstands predation but this variant produces low levels of cellulose and limited swarming motility. Our findings suggest that protozoan predation can profoundly influence the course of genetic and phenotypic evolution in a short period.","Golzar, F. S.; Ferguson, G. C.; Hendrickson, H.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,184049,Single-cell imaging of Pseudomonas reveals dynamic polar accumulation of the extracellular iron-scavenger pyoverdin,"Pyoverdin is a water-soluble metal-chelator synthesized by members of the genus Pseudomonas and used for the acquisition of insoluble ferric iron. Although freely diffusible in aqueous environments, preferential dissemination of pyoverdin among adjacent cells, fine-tuning of intracellular siderophore concentrations, and fitness advantages to pyoverdin-producing versus nonproducing cells, indicate control of location and release. Here, using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to track single cells in growing microcolonies of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, we show accumulation of pyoverdin at cell poles. Accumulation is induced by arrest of cell division, is achieved by cross-feeding in pyoverdin-nonproducing mutants, is independent of cell shape, and is reversible. Furthermore, it occurs in multi-species communities. Analysis of the performance of pyoverdin-producing and nonproducing cells under conditions promoting polar localization shows an advantage to accumulation on resumption of growth after stress. While the genetic basis of polarization remains unclear, evaluation of deletion mutants of pyoverdin transporters (opmQ, fpvA) establishes non-involvement of these candidate loci. Examination of pyoverdin polar accumulation in a model community and in a range of laboratory and natural species of Pseudomonas, including P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. putida KT2440, confirms that the phenotype is characteristic of Pseudomonas.

SignificanceBacteria secrete extracellular products that enable nutrients to be obtained from the environment. A secreted product of relevance for medicine, agriculture and biotechnology is the iron-chelating siderophore, pyoverdin, which is produced by members of the genus Pseudomonas. By analyzing the behavior of single cells we show that on cessation of cell division, pyoverdin localizes to cell poles, but is then released to the environment prior to resumption of cell growth. Of particular significance is the ecological relevance of this behavior: cells that accumulate the siderophore resume growth with minimal delay. Our study reveals a hitherto unrecognized dimension to the biology of Pseudomonas that may prove central to understanding the broader ecological and physiological relevance of pyoverdin.","Moreno-Fenoll, C.; Ardre, M.; Rainey, P.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,184888,Biofilm Interaction Mapping and Analysis (BIMA): A tool for deconstructing interspecific interactions in co-culture biofilms,"Pseudomonas species are ubiquitous in nature and include numerous medically, agriculturally and technologically beneficial strains of which the interspecific interactions are of great interest for biotechnologies. Specifically, co-cultures containing Pseudomonas stutzeri have been used for bioremediation, biocontrol, aquaculture management and wastewater denitrification. Furthermore, the use of P. stutzeri biofilms, in combination with consortia based approaches, may offer advantages for these processes. Understanding the interspecific interaction within biofilm co-cultures or consortia provides a means for improvement of current technologies. However, the investigation of biofilm based consortia has been limited. We present an adaptable and scalable method for the analysis of macroscopic interactions (colony morphology, inhibition and invasion) between colony forming bacterial strains using an automated printing method followed by analysis of the genes and metabolites involved in the interactions. Using Biofilm Interaction Mapping and Analysis (BIMA), these interactions were investigated between P. stutzeri strain RCH2, a denitrifier isolated from chromium (VI) contaminated soil, and thirteen other species of pseudomonas isolated from non-contaminated soil. The metabolites and genes associated with both active co-culture growth and inhibitory growth were investigated using mass spectrometry based metabolomics and mutant fitness profiling of a DNA-barcoded mutant library. One interaction partner, Pseudomonas fluorescens N1B4 was selected for mutant fitness profiling; with this approach four genes of importance were identified and the effects on interactions were evaluated with deletion mutants and metabolomics.

IMPORTANCEThe Biofilm Interaction Mapping and Analysis (BIMA) methodology provides a way to rapidly screen for positive and negative interspecific interactions, followed by an analysis of the genes and metabolites that may be involved. Knowledge of these may offer opportunities for engineered strains with improved function in biotechnology systems. P. stutzeri, an organism with wide-spread utilization in consortia based biotechnologies, was used to demonstrate the utility of this approach.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,185013,Evolutionary flexibility in routes to mat formation by Pseudomonas,"Many bacteria form mats at the air-liquid interface of static microcosms. These structures typically involve the secretion of exopolysaccharide(s), the production of which is often controlled by the secondary messenger c-di-GMP. Mechanisms of mat formation have been particularly well characterized in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25; mutations that lead to an increase in c-di-GMP production by diguanylate cyclases (WspR, AwsR, or MwsR) result in the secretion of cellulose, and mat formation. Here, we characterize and compare mat formation in two close relatives of SBW25: Pseudomonas simiae PICF7 and Pseudomonas fluorescens A506. We find that PICF7 - the strain more closely related to SBW25 - can form mats through mutations affecting the activity of the same three diguanylate cyclases as SBW25. However, instead of cellulose, these mutations activate the production of the Pel exopolysaccharide. We also provide evidence for at least two further - as yet uncharacterized - routes to PICF7 mat formation. P. fluorescens A506, while retaining the same mutational routes to mat formation as SBW25 and PICF7, forms mats by a semi-heritable mechanism that likely culminates in Pga and/or Psl production. Overall, our results demonstrate a high level of evolutionary flexibility in the molecular and structural routes to mat formation, even among close relatives.","Mukherjee, A.; Gallie, J.",2021-08-04,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2021.08.03.454897,1,Jenna  Gallie,Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.03.454897v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.03.454897v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1111/mmi.14855
Pseudomonas fluorescens,188657,Commensal Pseudomonas fluorescens protect Arabidopsis from closely-related Pseudomonas pathogens in a colonization-dependent manner,"Plants form commensal associations with soil microorganisms, creating a root microbiome that provides benefits to the host including protection against pathogens. While bacteria can inhibit pathogens through production of antimicrobial compounds in vitro, it is largely unknown how microbiota contribute to pathogen protection in planta. We developed a gnotobiotic model system consisting of Arabidopsis thaliana, and an opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas sp. N2C3, to identify mechanisms that determine the outcome of plant-pathogen-microbiome interactions in the rhizosphere. We screened 25 phylogenetically diverse Pseudomonas strains for their ability to protect against N2C3 and found that commensal strains closely related to N2C3 were more likely to protect against pathogenesis. We used a comparative genomics approach to identify unique genes in the protective strains that revealed no genes that correlate with protection, suggesting that variable regulation of components of the core Pseudomonas genome may contribute to pathogen protection. We found that commensal colonization level was highly predictive of protection and so tested deletions in genes previously shown to be required for Arabidopsis rhizosphere colonization. We identified a response regulator colR that is required for Pseudomonas protection from N2C3 and fitness in competition with N2C3 indicating that competitive exclusion may contribute to pathogen protection. We found that Pseudomonas WCS365 also protects against the agricultural pathogen Pseudomonas fuscovaginae SE-1, the causal agent of bacterial sheath brown rot of rice. This work establishes a gnotobiotic model to uncover mechanisms by which members of the microbiome can protect hosts from pathogens and informs our understanding of the use of beneficial strains for microbiome engineering in dysbiotic soil systems.","Wang, N.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,192100,Spatial structure affects evolutionary dynamics and drives genomic diversity in experimental populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens,"Most populations live in spatially structured environments and that structure has the potential to impact the evolutionary dynamics in a number of important ways. Theoretical models tracking evolution in structured environments using a range of different approaches, suggest that local interactions and spatial heterogeneity can increase the adaptive benefits of motility, impact both the rate and extent of adaptation, and increase the probability of parallel evolution. We test these general predictions in a microbial evolution experiment tracking phenotypic and genomic changes in replicate populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens evolved in both well-mixed and spatially-structured environments, where spatial structure was generated through the addition of semi-solid agar. In contrast to the well-mixed environment, populations evolved in the spatially-structured environment adapted more slowly, retained the ability to disperse more rapidly, and had a greater putatively neutral population genomic diversity. The degree of parallel evolution measured at the gene-level, did not differ across these two types of experimental environments, perhaps because the populations had not evolved for long enough to near their fitness optima. These results confirm important general impacts of spatial structure on evolutionary dynamics at both the phenotypic and genomic level.","Bailey, S.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,202272,The ColR/S two-component system is a conserved determinant of host association across Pseudomonas species,"Members of the bacterial genus Pseudomonas form mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic associations with diverse hosts. The prevalence of host association across the genus suggests that symbiosis may be a conserved ancestral trait and that distinct symbiotic lifestyles may be more recently evolved. Here we show that the ColR/S two-component system, part of the Pseudomonas core genome, is functionally conserved between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Using plant rhizosphere colonization and virulence in a murine abscess model, we show that colR is required for commensalism with plants and virulence in animals. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that the ColR regulon has diverged between P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens and deleting components of the ColR regulon revealed strain-specific, but not hostspecific, requirements for ColR-dependent genes. Collectively, our results suggest that ColR/S allows Pseudomonas to sense and respond to a host, but that the ColR-regulon has diverged between Pseudomonas strains with distinct lifestyles.","Wiesmann, C.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,206917,Interaction among bacterial cells triggers exit from lag phase,"The relationship between the number of cells colonizing a new environment and time for resumption of growth is a subject of long-standing interest. In microbiology this is known as the ""inoculum effect"". Its mechanistic basis is unclear with possible explanations ranging from the independent actions of individual cells, to collective actions of populations of cells. Progress requires precise measurement of lag time distributions while at the same time, experimentally controlling inoculum size. Here we use a millifluidic droplet device in which the growth dynamics of hundreds of populations founded by different numbers of Pseudomonas fluorescens cells, ranging from a single cell, to one thousand cells, were followed in real time. Our data show that lag phase decreases with inoculum size. The average decrease, variance across droplets, and distribution shapes, follow predictions of extreme value theory, where the inoculum lag time is determined by the minimum value sampled from the single-cell distribution. Our experimental results show that exit from lag phase depends on strong interactions among cells, consistent with a ""leader-cell"" triggering end of lag phase for the entire population.","Ardre, M.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,219453,Identification of cyclic-di-GMP-modulating protein residues by bi-directionally evolving a social trait in Pseudomonas fluorescens,"Modulation of the intracellular cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) pool is central to the formation of structured bacterial communities. Genome annotations predict the presence of dozens of conserved c-di-GMP catalytic enzymes in many bacterial species, but the functionality and regulatory control of the vast majority remain underexplored. Here, we begin to fill this gap by utilizing an experimental evolution system in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, which repeatedly produces a unique social trait through bidirectional transitions between two distinct phenotypes converging on c-di-GMP modulation. Parallel evolution of 33 lineages captured 147 unique mutations among 191 evolved isolates in genes that are empirically demonstrated, bioinformatically predicted, or previously unknown to impact the intracellular pool of c-di-GMP. Quantitative chemistry confirmed that each mutation causing the phenotypic shift predictably amplifies or reduces c-di-GMP production. We integrate our mutation, phenotype, and quantification data with current models of known regulatory and catalytic systems, describe a previously unknown relationship between a regulatory component of branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis and c-di-GMP production, and predict functions of unexpected proteins that clearly impact c-di-GMP production. Sequential mutations that continuously disrupt or recover c-di-GMP production across discrete functional elements suggest a complex and underappreciated interconnectivity within the c-di-GMP regulome of P. fluorescens.

ImportanceMicrobial communities comprise densely packed cells where competition for space and resources is fierce. In our model system, mutant cells with a dry (D) phenotype are selected from a population with a mucoid (M) phenotype, and vice versa, because M and D cells physically work together to spread away from the overcrowded colony. D cells produce high levels of c-di-GMP and M cells produce low levels, so each mutation impacts c-di-GMP production. C-di-GMP is a second messenger which regulates diverse bacterial phenotypes that cause tremendous clinical and environmental problems. Many bacteria possess dozens of enzymes that are predicted to produce c-di-GMP, but most are considered to be non-functional. Here, we take advantage of the bi-directional selection of M and D phenotypes to identify key residues that could force these enzymes to turn on or off. Several unexpected proteins also participate in this process, but very little is known about them.","Kessler, C.; Kim, W.",2022-08-02,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.05.10.491292,3,Wook  Kim,Duquesne University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.491292v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.10.491292v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,221571,Learning transcriptome dynamics for discovery of optimal genetic reporters of novel compounds,"Accelerating the design of synthetic biological circuits requires expanding the currently available genetic toolkit. Although whole-cell biosensors have been successfully engineered and deployed, particularly in applications such as environmental and medical diagnostics, novel sensing applications necessitate the discovery and optimization of novel biosensors. Here, we address this issue of the limited repertoire of biosensors by developing a data-driven, transcriptome-wide approach to discover perturbation-inducible genes from time-series RNA sequencing data, guiding the design of synthetic transcriptional reporters. By combining techniques from dynamical systems and control theory, we show that high-dimensional transcriptome dynamics can be efficiently represented and used to rank genes based on their ability to report the perturbation-specific cell state. We extract, construct, and validate 15 functional biosensors for the organophosphate malathion in the underutilized host organism Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, provide a computational approach to aggregate individual biosensor responses to facilitate enhanced reporting, and exemplify their ability to be useful outside the lab by detecting malathion in the environment. The library of living malathion sensors can be optimized for use in environmental diagnostics while the developed machine learning tool can be applied to discover perturbation-inducible gene expression systems in the compendium of host organisms.","Hasnain, A.; Balakrishnan, S.; Joshy, D.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,222315,Tomato brassinosteroid-signaling kinase Bsk830 is a component of flagellin signaling that regulates pre-invasion immunity,"Detection of bacterial flagellin by the tomato receptors Flagellin sensing 2 (Fls2) and Fls3 triggers activation of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Tomato signaling components associated or downstream of flagellin receptors are largely unknown. We investigated the involvement of tomato brassinosteroid-signaling kinase 830 (Bsk830) in PTI triggered by flagellin perception. Bsk830 localized to the plasma membrane and interacted with Fls2 and Fls3. Consistent with a role in flagellin- induced signaling, CRISPR/Cas9-generated tomato bsk830 mutants were impaired in ROS accumulation induced by the flagellin-derived flg22 and flgII-28 peptides. In addition, bsk830 mutants developed larger populations of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) strain DC3000 than wild-type plants, whereas no differences were observed in plants infected with the flagellin deficient Pst DC3000{Delta}fliC. bsk830 mutants failed to close stomata when infected with Pst DC3000 and Pseudomonas fluorescens, and were more susceptible to Pst DC3000 than wild-type plants when inoculated by dipping, but not by vacuum-infiltration, indicating involvement of Bsk830 in pre-invasion immunity. Analysis of gene expression profiles in bsk830 mutants detected a reduced number of differentially expressed genes and altered expression of jasmonic acid (JA)-related genes. In support of deregulation of JA response in bsk830 mutants, these plants were similarly susceptible to Pst DC3000 and to the Pst DC3118 strain, which is deficient in coronatine production, and more resistant to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea following PTI activation. These results indicate that tomato Bsk830 is required for a subset of flagellin-triggered PTI responses and support a model in which Bsk830 negatively regulates JA signaling during PTI activation.","Sobol, G.; Majhi, B.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,224364,Corner flows induced by surfactant-producing bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens,"Mechanistic understanding of bacterial spreading in soil is critical to control pathogenic contamination of groundwater and soil as well as design bioremediation projects. However, our understanding is currently limited by the lack of direct bacterial imaging in soil conditions. Here, we overcome this limitation by directly observing the spread of bacterial solution in a transparent chamber with varying corner angles designed to replicate soil-like conditions. We show that two common soil bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens, generate flows along sharp corners (< 60{degrees}) by producing surfactants that turn nonwetting solid surfaces into wetting surfaces. We further show that a surfactant-deficient mutant of B. subtilis cannot generate corner flows along sharp corners, confirming that the bacteria-generated corner flows require the production of bacterial surfactants. The speed of biosurfactant-induced corner flow at the sharp corner is about several millimeters per hour, similar to that of bacterial swarming, the fastest mode of known bacterial surface translocation. We further demonstrate that the bacteria-generated corner flow only occurs when the corner angle is less than a critical value, which can be predicted from the contact angle of the bacterial solution. Furthermore, we show that the corner flow has a maximum height due to the roundness or cutoff of corners. The mechanistic understanding and mathematical theories of bacterial spreading presented in this study will help improve predictions of bacterial spreading in soil, where corners are ubiquitous, and facilitate future designs of soil contamination mitigation and other bioremediation projects.

ImportanceThe spread of bacterial cells in soil regulates soil biogeochemical cycles, increases the possibility of soil and groundwater contamination, and controls the efficiency of many bacteria-based bioremediation projects. However, mechanistic understanding of bacterial spreading in soil remains incomplete due to a lack of direct or in-situ observations. Here, we simulate confined spaces of soil using a transparent material with similar hydrophobicity as hydrocarbon-covered soil and directly visualize the spread of two common soil bacteria, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens. We show that both bacteria can generate vertical flows along sharp corners of the transparent chamber. The velocity of the bacterial corner flow is several millimeters per hour. We further demonstrate that the corner flow was generated by bacteria-produced bio-surfactants, which are soap-like chemicals and turn nonwetting solid surfaces into wetting surfaces. Our results will help improve predictions of bacterial spreading in soil and facilitate designs of soil-related bioremediation projects.","Li, Y.; Sanfilippo, J.; Yang, J.",2022-06-21,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.06.20.496927,1,Judy  Yang,University of Minnesota-Twin Cities,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496927v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.20.496927v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,224965,Plasmid manipulation of bacterial behaviour through translational regulatory crosstalk,"Beyond their role in horizontal gene transfer, conjugative plasmids commonly encode homologues of bacterial regulators. Known plasmid regulator homologues have highly targeted effects upon the transcription of specific bacterial traits. Here, we characterise a plasmid translational regulator, RsmQ, capable of taking global regulatory control in Pseudomonas fluorescens and causing a behavioural switch from motile to sessile lifestyle. RsmQ acts as a global regulator controlling the host proteome through direct interaction with host mRNAs and interference with the hosts translational regulatory network. This mRNA interference leads to largescale proteomic changes in metabolic genes, key regulators and genes involved in chemotaxis, thus controlling bacterial metabolism and motility. Moreover, comparative analyses found RsmQ on a large number of divergent plasmids isolated from multiple bacterial host taxa, suggesting the widespread importance of RsmQ for manipulating bacterial behaviour across clinical, environmental, and agricultural niches. RsmQ is a widespread plasmid global translational regulator primarily evolved for host chromosomal control to manipulate bacterial behaviour and lifestyle.

Significance StatementPlasmids are recognised for their important role in bacterial evolution as drivers of horizontal gene transfer. Less well understood are the effects of plasmids upon bacterial behaviours by manipulating the expression of key bacterial phenotypes. Until now, examples of plasmid manipulation of their bacterial hosts were limited to highly targeted transcriptional control of a few related traits. In contrast, here we describe the first plasmid global translational regulator evolved to control the bacterial behavioural switch from a motile to a sessile lifestyle and bacterial metabolism, mediated through manipulation of the bacterial proteome. Moreover, this global translational regulator is common across divergent plasmids in a wide range of bacterial host taxa, suggesting that plasmids may commonly control bacterial lifestyle in the clinic, agricultural fields, and beyond.","Thompson, C.; Hall, J.; Chandra, G.; Martins, C.; Saalbach, G.; Bird, S.; Ford, S.; Little, R.; Piazza, A.; Harrison, E.; Jackson, R.; Brockhurst, M.; Malone, J.",2022-06-27,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.06.27.497698,1,Jacob  Malone,John Innes Centre/University of East Anglia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497698v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.27.497698v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,227488,"Comprehensive analysis of kill switch toxins in plant-beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens reveals drivers of lethality, stability, and escape","Kill switches provide a biocontainment strategy in which unwanted growth of an engineered microorganism is prevented by expression of a toxin gene. A major challenge in kill switch engineering is balancing evolutionary stability with robust cell killing activity in application relevant host strains. Understanding host-specific containment dynamics and modes of failure helps to develop potent yet stable kill switches. To guide the design of robust kill switches in the agriculturally relevant strain Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, we present a comparison of lethality, stability, and genetic escape of eight different toxic effectors in the presence of their cognate inactivators (i.e., toxin-antitoxin modules, polymorphic exotoxin-immunity systems, restriction endonuclease-methyltransferase pair). We find that cell killing capacity and evolutionary stability are inversely correlated and dependent on the level of protection provided by the inactivator gene. Decreasing the proteolytic stability of the inactivator protein can increase cell killing capacity, but at the cost of long-term circuit stability. By comparing toxins within the same genetic context, we determine that modes of genetic escape increase with circuit complexity and are driven by toxin activity, the protective capacity of the inactivator, and the presence of mutation-prone sequences within the circuit. Collectively, our study reveals that circuit complexity, toxin choice, inactivator stability, and DNA sequence design are powerful drivers of kill switch stability and valuable targets for optimization of biocontainment systems.","Halvorsen, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,228470,Spatial structure formation by RsmE-regulated extracellular secretions in Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1,"Cells in microbial communities on surfaces live and divide in close proximity, which greatly enhances the potential for social interactions. Spatiogenetic structures manifest through competitive and cooperative interactions among the same and different genotypes within a shared space, and extracellular secretions appear to function dynamically at the forefront. A previous experimental evolution study utilizing Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 colonies demonstrated that diverse mutations in the rsmE gene are repeatedly and exclusively selected through the formation of a dominant spatial structure. RsmEs primary molecular function is translation repression, and its homologs regulate various social and virulence phenotypes. Pseudomonas spp. possess multiple paralogs of Rsm proteins, and RsmA, RsmE, and RsmI are the most prevalent. Here, we demonstrate that the production of a mucoid polymer and a biosurfactant are exclusively regulated through RsmE, contradicting the generalized notion of functional redundancy among the Rsm paralogs. Furthermore, we identify the biosurfactant as the cyclic lipopeptide gacamide A. Competition and microscopy analyses show that the mucoid polymer is solely responsible for creating a space of low cellular density, which is shared exclusively by the same genotype. Gacamide A and other RsmE-regulated products appear to establish a physical boundary that prevents the encroachment of the competing genotype into the newly created space. Although cyclic lipopeptides and other biosurfactants are best known for their antimicrobial properties and reducing surface tension to promote the spreading of cells on various surfaces, they also appear to help define spatial structure formation within a dense community.

IMPORTANCEIn densely populated colonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, diverse mutations in the rsmE gene are naturally selected by solving the problem of overcrowding. Here, we show that RsmE-regulated secretions function together to create and protect space of low cell density. A biosurfactant generally promotes the spreading of bacterial cells on abiotic surfaces, however, it appears to function atypically within a crowded population by physically defining genotypic boundaries. Another significant finding is that these secretions are not regulated by RsmEs paralogs that share high sequence similarity. The experimental pipeline described in this study is highly tractable and should facilitate future studies to explore additional RsmE-regulated products and address why RsmE is functionally unique from its paralogs.","Evans, A.; Wells, M.; Denk, J.; Mazza, W.; Santos, R.; Delprince, A.; Kim, W.",2022-07-27,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.07.26.501654,1,Wook Kim,Duquesne University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501654v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.26.501654v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,228848,Compensatory mutations reducing the fitness cost of plasmid carriage occur in plant rhizosphere communities,"Plasmids drive bacterial evolutionary innovation by transferring ecologically important functions between lineages, but acquiring a plasmid often comes at a fitness cost to the host cell. Compensatory mutations, which ameliorate the cost of plasmid carriage, promote plasmid maintenance in simplified laboratory media across diverse plasmid-host associations. Whether such compensatory evolution can occur in more complex communities inhabiting natural environmental niches where evolutionary paths may be more constrained is, however, unclear. Here we show a substantial fitness cost of carrying the large conjugative plasmid pQBR103 in Pseudomonas fluorescens in the plant rhizosphere. This plasmid fitness cost could be ameliorated by compensatory mutations affecting the chromosomal global regulatory system gacA/gacS, which arose rapidly in plant rhizosphere communities and were exclusive to plasmid carriers. These findings expand our understanding of the importance of compensatory evolution in plasmid dynamics beyond simplified lab media. Compensatory mutations contribute to plasmid survival in bacterial populations living within complex microbial communities in their natural environmental niche.","Bird, S.; Ford, S.; Thompson, C. M.

Here, strategies are described for barcoding populations of the model bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, including the design and cloning of barcoded regions, preparation of libraries for amplicon sequencing, and quantification of resulting barcoded lineages.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,29535,Ribosome provisioning activates a bistable switch coupled to fast exit from stationary phase,"Observations of bacteria at the single-cell level have revealed many instances of phenotypic heterogeneity within otherwise clonal populations, but the selective causes, molecular bases and broader ecological relevance remain poorly understood. In an earlier experiment in which the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 was propagated under a selective regime that mimicked the host immune response, a genotype evolved that stochastically switched between capsulation states. The genetic cause was a mutation in carB that decreased the pyrimidine pool (and growth rate), lowering the activation threshold of a pre-existing but hitherto unrecognised phenotypic switch. Genetic components surrounding bifurcation of UTP flux towards DNA/RNA or UDP-glucose (a precursor of colanic acid forming the capsules) were implicated as key components. Extending these molecular analyses - and based on a combination of genetics, transcriptomics, biochemistry and mathematical modelling - we show that pyrimidine limitation triggers an increase in ribosome biosynthesis and that switching is caused by competition between ribosomes and CsrA/RsmA proteins for the mRNA transcript of a feed-forward regulator of colanic acid biosynthesis. We additionally show that in the ancestral bacterium the switch is part of a programme that determines stochastic entry into the semi-quiescent capsulated state, ensures that such cells are provisioned with excess ribosomes, and enables provisioned cells to exit rapidly from stationary phase under permissive conditions.","Remigi, P.; Ferguson, G.

Here, we deleted the mreB homolog from rod-shaped bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and found that{Delta} mreB cells are viable, spherical cells with a 20% reduction in competitive fitness and high variability in cell size. We show that cell death, correlated with increased levels of elongation asymmetry between sister cells, accounts for the large fitness reduction. After a thousand generations in rich media, the fitness of evolved{Delta} mreB lines was restored to ancestral levels and cells regained symmetry and ancestral size, while maintaining spherical shape. Using population sequencing, we identified pbp1A, coding for a protein involved in cell wall synthesis, as the primary target for compensatory mutations of the{Delta} mreB genotype. Our findings suggest that reducing elongasome associated PBPs aids in the production of symmetric cells when MreB is absent.","Yulo, P. R.; Desprat, N.; Gerth, M.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,34807,Characterizing Genetic Circuit Components in E. coli towards a Campylobacter jejuni Biosensor.,"Campylobacter jejuni is responsible for most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis (food poisoning) in the United Kingdom. The most common routes of transmission are by contact with raw poultry. Current detection systems for the pathogen are time-consuming, expensive or inaccessible for everyday users. In this article we propose a cheaper and faster system for detection of C. jejuni using a synthetic biology approach. We aimed to detect C. jejuni by the presence of xylulose, an uncommon bacterial capsular saccharide. We characterized two sugar-based regulatory systems that displayed potential to act as tools for detection of xylulose. Using a two-plasmid reporter system in Escherichia coli, we investigated the regulatory protein component (MtlR) of the mannitol operon from Pseudomonas fluorescens. Our findings suggest that the promoter of mtlE is activated by MtlR in the presence of a variety of sugar inducer molecules, and may exhibit cross-activity with a native regulator of E. coli. Additionally, we engineered the L-arabinose transcriptional activator (AraC) of E. coli for altered ligand specificity. We performed site-specific saturation mutagenesis to generate AraC variants with altered effector specificity, with an aim to generate a mutant activated by xylulose. We characterized several mutant AraC variants which have lost the ability to respond specifically to the native L-arabinose effector. We promote this technique as a powerful tool for future iGEM teams to create regulatory circuits activated by novel small molecule ligands.","Brzozowska, N.; Gourlay, J.; O'sullivan, A.; Buchanan, F.; Hannah, R.; Stewart, A.; Taylor, H.; Docea, R.; Mclay, G.; Giuliano, A.; Provan, J.; Baker, K.; Abioye, J.; Reboud, J.; Colloms, S.",2018-03-27,Synthetic Biology,10.1101/290155,1,Natalia  Brzozowska,University of Glasgow,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/290155v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/290155v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas fluorescens,35215,Consumption of carotenoids not increased by bacterial infection in brown trout embryos (Salmo trutta),"Carotenoids are organic pigment molecules that play important roles in signalling, control of oxidative stress, and immunity. Fish allocate carotenoids to their eggs, which gives them the typical yellow to red colouration and supports their resistance against microbial infections. However, it is still unclear whether carotenoids act mainly as a shield against infection or are used up during the embryos immune defence. We investigated this question with experimental families produced from wild-caught brown trout (Salmo trutta). Singly raised embryos were either exposed to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas fluorescens or sham-treated at one of two stages during their development. A previous study on these experimental families reported positive effects of egg carotenoids on embryo growth and resistance against the infection. Here, we quantified carotenoid consumption in these infected and sham-infected maternal sib groups. We found that carotenoid contents mostly decreased during embryogenesis. However, these decreases were neither linked to the virulence induced by the pathogen nor dependent on the time point of infection. We conclude that egg carotenoids are not significantly used up by the embryos immune defence.","Marques Da Cunha, L.; Wilkins, L. G.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,35566,Interspecies Social Spreading: Interaction between two sessile soil bacteria leads to emergence of surface motility,"Bacteria often live in complex communities in which they interact with other organisms. Consideration of the social environment of bacteria can reveal emergent traits and behaviors that would be overlooked by studying bacteria in isolation. Here we characterize a social trait which emerges upon interaction between the distantly-related soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48. On hard agar, which is not permissive for motility of the mono-culture of either species, co-culture reveals an emergent phenotype we term  interspecies social spreading, where the mixed colony spreads across the hard surface. We show that initiation of social spreading requires close association between the two species of bacteria. Both species remain associated throughout the spreading colony, with reproducible and non-homogenous patterns of distribution. The nutritional environment influences social spreading; no social behavior is observed under high nutrient conditions, but low nutrient conditions are insufficient to promote social spreading without high salt concentrations. This simple two-species consortium is a tractable model system that will facilitate mechanistic investigations of interspecies interactions and provide insight into emergent properties of interacting species. These studies will contribute to the broader knowledge of how bacterial interactions influence the functions of communities they inhabit.\n\nImportanceThe wealth of studies on microbial communities has revealed the complexity and dynamics of the composition of communities in many ecological settings. Fewer studies probe the functional interactions of the community members. Function of the community as a whole may not be fully revealed by characterizing the individuals. In our two-species model community, we find an emergent trait resulting from the interaction of the soil bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48. Observation of emergent traits suggests there may be many functions of a community that are not predicted based on a priori knowledge of the community members. These types of studies will provide a more holistic understanding of microbial communities, allowing us to connect information about community composition with behaviors determined by interspecific interactions. These studies increase our ability to understand communities, such as the soil microbiome, plant-root microbiome, and human gut microbiome, with the final goal of being able to manipulate and rationally improve these communities.","Mccully, L.

Structure-guided mutagenesis and library screening led to a usable iGABASnFR ({Delta}F/Fmax ~ 2.5, Kd ~ 9 M, good specificity, adequate kinetics). iGABASnFR is genetically encoded, detects single action potential-evoked GABA release events in culture, and produces readily detectable fluorescence increases in vivo in mice and zebrafish. iGABASnFR enabled tracking of: (1) mitochondrial GABA content and its modulation by an anticonvulsant; (2) swimming-evoked GABAergic transmission in zebrafish cerebellum; (3) GABA release events during inter-ictal spikes and seizures in awake mice; and (4) GABAergic tone decreases during isoflurane anesthesia. iGABASnFR will permit high spatiotemporal resolution of GABA signaling in intact preparations.","Looger, L.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,40294,Predicting mutational routes to new adaptive phenotypes,"Predicting evolutionary change poses numerous challenges. Here we take advantage of the model bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in which the genotype-to-phenotype map determining evolution of the adaptive \""wrinkly spreader\"" (WS) type is known. We present mathematical descriptions of three necessary regulatory pathways and use these to predict both the rate at which each mutational route is used and the expected mutational targets. To test predictions, mutation rates and targets were determined for each pathway. Unanticipated mutational hotspots caused experimental observations to depart from predictions but additional data led to refined models. A mismatch was observed between the spectra of WS-causing mutations obtained with and without selection due to low fitness of previously undetected WS-causing mutations. Our findings contribute toward the development of mechanistic models for forecasting evolution, highlight current limitations, and draw attention to challenges in predicting locus-specific mutational biases and fitness effects.\n\nImpact statementA combination of genetics, experimental evolution and mathematical modelling defines information necessary to predict the outcome of short-term adaptive evolution.","Lind, P.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,40874,Evolutionary forecasting of phenotypic and genetic outcomes of experimental evolution in Pseudomonas protegens,"Experimental evolution with microbes is often highly repeatable under identical conditions, suggesting the possibility to predict short-term evolution. However, it is not clear to what degree evolutionary forecasts can be extended to related species in non-identical environments, which would allow testing of general predictive models and fundamental biological assumptions. To develop an extended model system for evolutionary forecasting, we used previous data and models of the genotype-to-phenotype map from the wrinkly spreader system in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 to make predictions of evolutionary outcomes on different biological levels for Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5. In addition to sequence divergence (78% amino acid and 81% nucleotide identity) for the genes targeted by mutations, these species also differ in the inability of Pf-5 to make cellulose, which is the main structural basis for the adaptive phenotype in SBW25. The experimental conditions were also changed compared to the SBW25 system to test the robustness of forecasts to environmental variation. Forty-three mutants with increased ability to colonize the air-liquid interface were isolated, and the majority had reduced motility and was partly dependent on the pel exopolysaccharide as a structural component. Most (38/43) mutations are expected to disrupt negative regulation of the same three diguanylate cyclases as in SBW25, with a smaller number of mutations in promoter regions, including that of an uncharacterized polysaccharide operon. A mathematical model developed for SBW25 predicted the order of the three main pathways and the genes targeted by mutations, but differences in fitness between mutants and mutational biases also appear to influence outcomes. Mutated regions in proteins could be predicted in most cases (16/22), but parallelism at the nucleotide level was low and mutational hot spots were not conserved. This study demonstrates the potential of short-term evolutionary forecasting in experimental populations and provides testable predictions for evolutionary outcomes in other Pseudomonas species.

Author SummaryBiological evolution is often repeatable in the short-term suggesting the possibility of forecasting and controlling evolutionary outcomes. In addition to its fundamental importance for biology, evolutionary processes are at the core of several major societal problems, including infectious diseases, cancer and adaptation to climate change. Experimental evolution allows study of evolutionary processes in real time and seems like an ideal way to test the predictability of evolution and our ability to make forecasts. However, lack of model systems where forecasts can be extended to other species evolving under different conditions has prevented studies that first predict evolutionary outcomes followed by direct testing. We showed that a well-characterized bacterial experimental evolution system, based on biofilm formation by Pseudomonas fluorescens at the surface of static growth tubes, can be extended to the related species Pseudomonas protegens. We tested evolutionary forecasts experimentally and showed that mutations mainly appear in the predicted genes resulting in similar phenotypes. We also identified factors that we cannot yet predict, such as variation in mutation rates and differences in fitness. Finally, we make forecasts for other Pseudomonas species to be tested in future experiments.","Pentz, J. T.; Lind, P.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,41159,Convergent gain and loss of genomic islands drives lifestyle changes in plant-associated Pseudomonas,"Host-associated bacteria can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on host health. While some of the molecular mechanisms that determine these outcomes are known, little is known about the evolutionary histories of pathogenic or mutualistic lifestyles. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we found that closely related strains within the Pseudomonas fluorescens species complex promote plant growth and occasionally cause disease. To elucidate the genetic basis of the transition between commensalism and pathogenesis, we developed a computational pipeline and identified genomic islands that correlate with outcomes for plant health. One island containing genes for lipopeptide biosynthesis and quorum sensing is required for pathogenesis. Conservation of the quorum sensing machinery in this island allows pathogenic strains to eavesdrop on quorum signals in the environment and coordinate pathogenic behavior. We found that genomic loci associated with both pathogenic and commensal lifestyles were convergently gained and lost in multiple lineages through homologous recombination, possibly constituting an early step in the differentiation of pathogenic and commensal lifestyles. Collectively this work provides novel insights into the evolution of commensal and pathogenic lifestyles within a single clade of host-associated bacteria.","Melnyk, R. A.; Hossain, S. S.; Haney, C.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,42586,Coopting the Lap system of Pseudomonas fluorescens to reversibly customize bacterial cell surfaces,"Initialattachment to a surface is a key and highly regulated step in biofilm formation. In this study, we present a platform for reversibly functionalizing bacterial cell surfaces, with an emphasis on designing biofilms. We engineered the Lap system of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, which is normally used to regulate initial cell surface attachment, to display various protein cargo at the bacterial cell surface and control extracellular release of the cargo in response to changing levels of the second messenger cdi-GMP. To accomplish this goal, we fused the protein cargo between the N-terminal retention module and C-terminal secretion signal of LapA, and controlled surface localization of the cargo with natural signals known to stimulate or deplete c-di-GMP levels in P. fluorescens Pf0-1. We show this system can tolerate large cargo in excess of 500 amino acids, direct P. fluorescens Pf0-1 to surfaces it does not typically colonize, and program this microbe to sequester the toxic medal cadmium.","Smith, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,43916,A broad-host-range event detector: expanding and quantifying performance across bacterial species,"Modern microbial biodesign relies on the principle that well-characterized genetic parts can be reused and reconfigured for different functions. However, this paradigm has only been successful in a limited set of hosts, mostly comprised from common lab strains of Escherichia coli. It is clear that new applications - such as chemical sensing and event logging in complex environments - will benefit from new host chassis. This study quantitatively compared how a chemical event logger performed across multiple microbial species. An integrase-based sensor and memory device was operated by two representative soil Pseudomonads - Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 and Pseudomonas putida DSM 291. Quantitative comparisons were made between these two non-traditional hosts and two bench-mark Escherichia coli chassis including the probiotic Nissle 1917 and common cloning strain DH5. The performance of sensor and memory components changed according to each host, such that a clear chassis effect was observed and quantified. These results were obtained via fluorescence from reporter proteins that were transcriptionally fused to the integrase and down-stream recombinant region and via data-driven kinetic models. The Pseudomonads proved to be acceptable chassis for the operation of this event logger, which outperformed the common E. coli DH5 in many ways. This study advances an emerging frontier in synthetic biology that aims to build broad-host-range devices and understand the context by which different species can execute programmable genetic operations.","Khan, N.; Yeung, E.; Farris, Y.; Fansler, S.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,44560,A genome-wide screen identifies genes in rhizosphere-associated Pseudomonas required to evade plant defenses,"Pseudomonas fluorescens and related plant root- (\""rhizosphere\"") associated species contribute to plant health by modulating defenses and facilitating nutrient uptake. To identify bacterial fitness determinants in the rhizosphere of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed a Tn-Seq screen using the biocontrol and growth-promoting strain Pseudomonas sp. WCS365. The screen, which was performed in parallel on wild-type and an immunocompromised Arabidopsis, identified 231 genes that positively affect fitness in the rhizosphere of wild-type plants. A subset of these genes negatively affect fitness in the rhizosphere of immunocompromised plants. We postulated that these genes might be involved in avoiding plant defenses and verified 7 Pseudomonas sp. WCS365 candidate genes by generating clean deletions. We found that two of these deletion strains, {Delta}morA (encodes a putative diguanylate cyclase/phosphodiesterase) and {Delta}spuC (encodes a putrescine aminotransferase) formed enhanced biofilms and inhibited plant growth. Inhibition of plant growth by {Delta}spuC and {Delta}morA was the result of pattern triggered immunity (PTI) as measured by induction of an Arabidopsis PTI reporter and FLS2/BAK1-dependent inhibition of plant growth. We found that MorA acts as a phosphodiesterase to inhibit biofilm formation suggesting a possible role in biofilm dispersal. We found that both putrescine and its precursor arginine promote biofilm formation that is enhanced in the {Delta}spuC mutant, which cannot break down putrescine suggesting that putrescine might serve as a signaling molecule in the rhizosphere. Collectively, this work identified novel bacterial factors required to evade plant defenses in the rhizosphere.\n\nImportanceWhile rhizosphere bacteria hold the potential to improve plant health and fitness, little is known about the bacterial genes required to evade host immunity. Using a model system consisting of Arabidopsis and a beneficial Pseudomonas sp. isolate, we identified bacterial genes required for both rhizosphere fitness and for evading host immune responses. This work advances our understanding of how evasion of host defenses contributes to survival in the rhizosphere.","Liu, Z.; Beskrovnaya, P.; Melnyk, R. A.; Hossain, S.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,48080,Meta-population structure and the evolutionary transition to multicellularity,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe evolutionary transition to multicellularity has occurred on numerous occasions, but transitions to complex life forms are rare. While the reasons are unclear, relevant factors include the intensity of within-versus between-group selection that are likely to have shaped the course of life cycle evolution. A highly structured environment eliminates the possibility of mixing between evolving lineages, thus ensuring strong competition between groups. Less structure intensifies competition within groups, decreasing opportunity for group-level evolution. Here, using populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we report the results of experiments that explore the effect of lineage mixing on the evolution of nascent multicellular groups. Groups were propagated under regimes requiring reproduction via a life cycle replete with developmental and dispersal (propagule) phases, but in one treatment lineages never mixed, whereas in a second treatment, cells from different lineages experienced intense competition during the dispersal phase. The latter treatment favoured traits promoting cell growth at the expense of traits underlying group fitness - a finding that is supported by results from a mathematical model. Together our results show that the transition to multicellularity benefits from ecological conditions that maintain discreteness not just of the group (soma) phase, but also of the dispersal (germline) phase.","Rose, C.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,49608,Repeated phenotypic evolution by different genetic routes: the evolution of colony switching in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25,"Repeated evolution of functionally similar phenotypes is observed throughout the tree of life. The extent to which the underlying genetics are conserved remains an area of considerable interest. Previously, we reported the evolution of colony switching in two independent lineages of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 (Beaumont et al., 2009). The phenotypic and genotypic bases of colony switching in the first lineage (Line 1) have been described elsewhere (Beaumont et al., 2009; Gallie et al., 2015). Here, we deconstruct the evolution of colony switching in the second lineage (Line 6). We show that, as for Line 1, Line 6 colony switching results from an increase in the expression of a colanic acid-like polymer (CAP). At the genetic level, nine mutations occur in Line 6. Only one of these - a non-synonymous point mutation in the housekeeping sigma factor rpoD - is required for colony switching. In contrast, the genetic basis of colony switching in Line 1 is a mutation in the metabolic gene carB (Beaumont et al., 2009). A molecular model has recently been proposed whereby the carB mutation increases capsulation by redressing the intracellular balance of positive (ribosomes) and negative (RsmAE/CsrA) regulators of a positive feedback loop in capsule expression (Remigi et al., 2018). We show that Line 6 colony switching is consistent with this model; the rpoD mutation generates an increase in ribosome expression, and ultimately an increase in CAP expression.","Gallie, J.; Bertels, F.; Remigi, P.; Ferguson, G.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,55683,Interrogation of genes controlling biofilm formation using CRISPR interference in Pseudomonas fluorescens,"Bacterial biofilm formation involves multigenic signaling and regulatory pathways that control the transition from motile to sessile lifestyle, production of extracellular polymeric matrix, and maturation of the biofilm complex 3D structure. Biofilms are extensively studied because of their importance in biomedical, ecological and industrial settings. Genetic approaches based on gene inactivation are powerful for mechanistic studies but often are labor intensive, limiting systematic gene surveys to the most tractable bacterial hosts. Here, we adapted the CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system for use in P. fluorescens. We found that CRISPRi is applicable to three genetically and physiologically diverse species, SBW25, WH6 and Pf0-1 and affords extended periods of time to study complex phenotypes such as cell morphology, motility and biofilm formation. In SBW25, CRISPRi-mediated silencing of the GacA/S two-component system and genes regulated by cylic-di-GMP produced phenotypes similar to those previously described after gene inactivation in various Pseudomonas. Combined with detailed confocal microscopy of biofilms, our study also revealed novel phenotypes associated with biofilm architecture and extracellular matrix biosynthesis as well as the potent inhibition of SBW25 biofilm formation mediated by the PFLU1114 protein. Thus, CRISPRi is a reliable and scalable approach to interrogate gene networks in the diverse P. fluorescens group.","Noirot-Gros, M.-F.; Forrester, S.; Malato, G.; Larsen, P.; Noirot, P.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,59070,Functional imaging of microbial interactions with tree roots using a microfluidics setup,"Coupling microfludics with microscopy has emerged as a powerful approach to study at cellular resolution the dynamics in plant physiology and root-microbe interactions. Most devices have been designed to study the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana at higher throughput than conventional methods. However, there is a need for microfluidic devices which enable in vivo studies of root development and root-microbe interactions in woody plants. Here, we developed the RMI-chip, a simple microfluidic setup in which Populus tremuloides (aspen tree) seedlings can grow for over a month, allowing continuous microscopic observation of interactions between live roots and rhizobacteria. We find that the colonization of growing aspen roots by Pseudomonas fluorescens in the RMI-chip involves dynamic biofilm formation and dispersal, in keeping with previous observations in a different experimental set-up. Also, we find that whole-cell biosensors based on the rhizobacterium Bacillus subtilis can be used to monitor compositional changes in the rhizosphere but that the application of these biosensors is limited by their efficiency at colonizing aspen roots and persisting. These results indicate that functional imaging of dynamic root-bacteria interactions in the RMI-chip requires careful matching between the host plant and the bacterial root colonizer.","Noirot-Gros, M.-F.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,59954,EvolvingSTEM: A microbial evolution-in-action curriculum that enhances learning of evolutionary biology and biotechnology,"Evolution is a central, unifying theory for all of life science, yet the subject is poorly represented in most secondary-school biology courses, especially in the United States. One challenge to learning evolution is that it is taught as a conceptual, retrospective subject with few tangible outcomes for students. These typical passive learning strategies lead to student disengagement with the material and misunderstanding of evolutionary concepts. To promote greater investment and comprehension, we developed EvolvingSTEM, an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum that demonstrates concepts of natural selection, heredity, and ecological diversity through experimental evolution of a benign bacterium. Students transfer populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens growing on plastic beads, which selects for biofilm formation and mutants with new, conspicuous phenotypes. We introduced our curriculum to four introductory high school biology classes alongside their standard curriculum materials and found that students who learned evolution through EvolvingSTEM scored significantly better on a common assessment targeted to Next Generation Science Standards than students taught only the standard curriculum. This latter group subsequently achieved similar scores once they too completed our curriculum. Our work demonstrates that inquiry-based, hands-on experiences with evolving bacterial populations can greatly enhance student learning of evolutionary concepts.","Cooper, V. S.; Warren, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,62560,Causes and biophysical consequences of cellulose production by Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 at the air-liquid interface,"Cellulose over-producing wrinkly spreader mutants of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 have been the focus of much investigation, but conditions promoting the production of cellulose in ancestral SBW25, its effects and consequences have escaped investigation through lack of in vitro phenotype. Here, using a custom built device, we reveal that in static broth microcosms ancestral SBW25 encounters environmental signals at the air-liquid interface that activate, via three diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways (Wsp, Aws and Mws), production of cellulose. Secretion of the polymer at the meniscus leads to modification of the environment and growth of numerous micro-colonies that extend out from the surface. Accumulation of cellulose and associated microbial growth leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability resulting in bioconvection and rapid transport of water-soluble products over tens of millimetres. Drawing upon data we build a mathematical model that recapitulates experimental results and captures the interactions between biological, chemical and physical processes.

IMPORTANCEThis work reveals a new bacterial behaviour that manifests at the air-liquid interface, which depends on production of cellulose, and hints to hitherto unrecognised dimensions to bacterial life at surfaces. Additionally, the study links activation of known diguanylate cyclase-encoding pathways to cellulose expression and to signals encountered at the air-liquid interface. Further significance stems from recognition of the consequences of fluid instabilities arising from surface production of cellulose for transport of water-soluble products over large distances.","Ardre, M.; Dufour, D.; Rainey, P.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,64352,Temperature-dependent changes to host-parasite interactions alter the thermal performance of a bacterial host.,"Thermal performance curves (TPCs) are used to predict changes in species interactions, and hence range shifts, disease dynamics and community composition, under forecasted climate change. Species interactions might in turn affect TPCs. Here, we investigate whether temperature-dependent changes in a microbial host-parasite interaction (the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, and its bacteriophage, SBW[FE]2) changes the host TPC. The bacteriophage had a narrower infectivity range, with their critical thermal maximum [~]6{degrees}C lower than those at which the bacteria still had high growth. Consequently, in the presence of phage, the host TPC had a higher optimum temperature and a lower maximum growth rate. These changes were driven by a temperature-dependent evolution, and cost, of resistance; the largest cost of resistance occurring where bacteria grew best in the absence of phage. Our work highlights how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms can alter the effect of a parasite on host thermal performance, even over very short timescales.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,65866,"Field trial of a probiotic bacteria and a chemical, chitosan, to protect bats from white-nose syndrome","Tools for reducing wildlife disease impacts are needed to conserve biodiversity. White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has caused widespread declines in North American bat populations and threatens several species with extinction. Few tools exist for managers to reduce WNS impacts. We tested the efficacy of two treatments, a probiotic bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and a chemical, chitosan, to reduce impacts of WNS in two simultaneous experiments conducted with caged and free-flying Myotis lucifugus bats at a mine in Wisconsin, USA. In the free-flying experiment, treatment with P. fluorescens increased apparent overwinter survival five-fold compared to the control group (from 8.4% to 46.2%) by delaying emergence of bats from the site by 30 days. Apparent overwinter survival for free-flying chitosan-treated bats was 18.0%, which did not differ significantly from control bats. In the cage experiment, chitosan-treated bats had significantly higher survival until release on March 8 (53%) than control and P. fluorescens-treated bats (both 27%). However, these differences were likely due to within-cage disturbance and not reduced WNS impacts, because chitosan-treated bats actually had significantly higher UV-fluorescence (a measure of disease severity), and body mass, not infection intensity, predicted mortality. Further, few of the bats released from the cage experiment were detected emerging from the mine, indicating that the survival estimates at the time of release did not carryover to overwinter survival. These results suggest that treatment of bats may reduce WNS mortality, but additional measures are needed to prevent declines.","Hoyt, J. R.; Langwig, K. E.; White, J. P.; Kaarakka, H. M.; Redell, J.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,68182,Two forms of phosphomannomutase in gammaproteobacteria: The overlooked membrane-bound form of AlgC is required for twitching motility of Lysobacter enzymogenes,"Lysobacter enzymogenes, a member of Xanthomonadaceae, is a promising tool to control crop-destroying fungal pathogens. One of its key antifungal virulence factors is the type IV pili that are required for twitching motility. Transposon mutagenesis of L. enzymogenes revealed that production of type IV pili required the presence of the Le2152 gene, which encodes an AlgC-type phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM). However, in addition to the cytoplasmic PMM domain, the Le2152 gene product contains a ca. 200-aa N-terminal periplasmic domain that is anchored in the membrane by two transmembrane segments and belongs to the dCache superfamily of periplasmic sensor domains. Sequence analysis identified similar membrane-anchored PMMs, encoded in conserved coaBC-dut-algC gene clusters, in a variety of gammaproteobacteria, either as the sole PMM gene in the entire genome or in addition to the gene encoding the stand-alone enzymatic domain. Previously overlooked N-terminal periplasmic sensor domains were detected in the well-characterized PMMs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas campestris, albeit not in the enzymes from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida or Azotobacter vinelandii. It appears that after the initial cloning of the enzymatically active soluble part of P. aeruginosa AlgC in 1991, all subsequent studies utilized N-terminally truncated open reading frames. The N-terminal dCache sensor domain of AlgC is predicted to modulate the PMM activity of the cytoplasmic domain in response to as yet unidentified environmental signal(s).

Pseudomonas fluorescens,75072,Root morphology and exudate availability is shaped by particle size and chemistry in Brachypodium distachyon,"Root morphology and exudation define a plants sphere of influence in soils, and are in turn shaped by the physiochemical characteristics of soil. We explored how particle size and chemistry of growth substrates affect root morphology and exudation of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. Root fresh weight and root lengths were correlated with particle size, whereas root number and shoot weight remained constant. Mass spectrometry imaging suggested that both, root length and number shape root exudation. Exudate metabolite profiles detected with liquid chromatography / mass spectrometry were comparable for plants growing in glass beads or sand with various particles sizes, but distinct for plants growing in clay. However, when exudates of clay-grown plants were collected by removing the plants from the substrate, their exudate profile was similar to sand- or glass beads-grown plants. Clay particles sorbed 20% of compounds exuded by clay-grown plants, and 70% of compounds of a defined exudate medium. The sorbed compounds belonged to a range of chemical classes, among them nucleosides/nucleotides, organic acids, sugars, and amino acids. Some of the sorbed compounds could be de-sorbed by a rhizobacterium (Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS415), supporting its growth. We show that root morphology is affected by substrate size, and that root exudation in contrast is not affected by substrate size or chemistry. The availability of exuded compounds, however, depends on the substrate present. These findings further support the critical importance of the physiochemical properties of soils are crucial to consider when investigating plant morphology, exudation, and plant-microbe interactions.","Sasse Schlaepfer, J.; Jordan, J.; De Raad, M.; Whiting, K.; Zhalnina, K.; Northen, T.",2019-05-27,Plant Biology,10.1101/651570,1,Joelle  Sasse Schlaepfer,Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/651570v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/651570v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1002/pld3.207
Pseudomonas fluorescens,76360,Bacterial survival in microscopic droplets,"Plant leaves constitute a huge microbial habitat of global importance. How microorganisms survive the dry daytime on leaves and avoid desiccation is not well-understood. There is evidence that microscopic wetness in the form of thin films and micrometer-sized droplets, invisible to the naked eye, persists on leaves during daytime due to deliquescence - the absorption of water until dissolution - of hygroscopic aerosols. Here we study how such microscopic wetness affects cell survival. We show that, on surfaces drying under moderate humidity, stable microdroplets form around bacterial aggregates due to deliquescence and capillary pinning. Notably, droplet-size increases with aggregate-size and the survival of cells is higher the larger the droplet. This phenomenon was observed for 13 different bacterial species, two of which - Pseudomonas fluorescens and P. putida - were studied in depth. Microdroplet formation around aggregates are likely key to bacterial survival in a variety of unsaturated microbial habitats, including leaf surfaces.","Grinberg, M.; Orevi, T.; Steinberg, S.; Kashtan, N.",2019-06-06,Microbiology,10.1101/662437,1,Nadav  Kashtan,The Hebrew University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/662437v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/662437v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.7554/eLife.48508
Pseudomonas fluorescens,79894,Two-way microscale interactions between immigrant bacteria and plant leaf microbiota as revealed by live imaging,"The phyllosphere - the aerial parts of plants - is an important microbial habitat that is home to diverse microbial communities. The spatial organization of bacterial cells on leaf surfaces is non-random, and correlates with leaf microscopic features. Yet, the role of microscale interactions between bacterial cells therein is not well understood. Here, we ask how interactions between immigrant bacteria and resident microbiota affect the spatial organization of the combined community. By means of live imaging in a simplified in vitro system, we studied the spatial organization, at the micrometer scale, of the bio-control agent Pseudomonas fluorescens A506 and the plant pathogen P. syringae B728a when introduced to pear and bean leaf microbiota (the corresponding native plants of these strains). We found significant co-localization of immigrant and resident microbial cells at distances of a few micrometers, for both strains. Interestingly, this co-localization was in part due to preferential attachment of microbiota cells near newly formed P. fluorescens aggregates. Our results indicate that two-way immigrant bacteria - resident microbiota interactions affect the leafs microscale spatial organization, and possibly that of other surface-related microbial communities.","Steinberg, S.; Grinberg, M.; Beitelman, M.; Peixoto, J.; Orevi, T.; Kashtan, N.",2020-06-17,Microbiology,10.1101/695734,2,Nadav  Kashtan,The Hebrew University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695734v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695734v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1038/s41396-020-00767-z
Pseudomonas fluorescens,81109,"Self-immunity guided identification of threonyl-tRNA synthetase as the molecular target of obafluorin, a β-lactone antibiotic","To meet the ever-growing demand of antibiotic discovery, new chemical matter and antibiotic targets are urgently needed. Many potent natural product antibiotics which were previously discarded can also provide lead molecules and drug targets. One such example is the structurally unique {beta}-lactone obafluorin, produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 39502. Obafluorin is active against both Grampositive and -negative pathogens, however the biological target was unknown. We now report that obafluorin targets threonyl-tRNA-synthetase and we identify a homologue, ObaO, which confers self-immunity to the obafluorin producer. Disruption of obaO in P. fluorescens ATCC 39502 results in obafluorin sensitivity, whereas expression in sensitive E. coli strains confers resistance. Enzyme assays demonstrate that E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase is fully inhibited by obafluorin, whereas ObaO is only partly susceptible, exhibiting a very unusual partial inhibition mechanism. Altogether, our data highlight the utility of a self-immunity guided approach for the identification of an antibiotic target de novo and will ultimately enable the generation of improved obafluorin variants.","Scott, T.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,86734,"Exploration of social spreading reveals behavior is prevalent among Pedobacter and P. fluorescens isolates, and shows variations in induction of phenotype","Within soil, bacteria are naturally found in multi-species communities, where interactions can lead to emergent community properties. It is critical that we study bacteria in a social context to investigate community-level functions. We previously showed that when co-cultured, Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48 engage in interspecies social spreading on a hard agar surface, a behavior which required close contact and was dependent on the nutritional environment. In this study, we investigate whether the ability to participate in social spreading is widespread among P. fluorescens and Pedobacter isolates, and whether the requirements for interaction vary. We find that this phenotype is not restricted to the interaction between P. fluorescens Pf0-1 and Pedobacter sp. V48, but is a more prevalent behavior found in one clade in the P. fluorescens group and two clades in the Pedobacter genus. We also discovered that the interaction with certain Pedobacter isolates occurred without close contact, indicating induction of spreading by a putative diffusible signal. As is the case for ISS by Pf0-1+V48, motility of all interacting pairs is influenced by the environment, with no spreading behaviors observed under high nutrient conditions. While Pf0-1+V48 require low nutrient but high NaCl conditions, in the broader range of interacting pairs this requirement for low nutrient and high salt was variable. The prevalence of motility phenotypes observed in this study and found within the literature indicates that community-induced locomotion in general, and social spreading in particular, is likely important within the environment. It is crucial that we continue to study microbial interactions and their emergent properties to gain a fuller understanding of the functions of microbial communities.","Mccully, L.

Pseudomonas fluorescens,87856,Plant-microbe co-evolution: allicin resistance in a Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (PfAR-1) isolated from garlic,"The antibiotic defense substance allicin (diallylthiosulfinate) is produced by garlic (Allium sativum L.) after tissue damage, giving garlic its characteristic odor. Allicin is a redox-toxin that oxidizes thiols in glutathione and cellular proteins. A highly allicin-resistant Pseudomonas fluorescens strain (PfAR-1) was isolated from garlic, and genomic clones were shotgun electroporated into an allicin-susceptible P. syringae strain (Ps4612). Recipients showing allicin-resistance had all inherited a group of genes from one of three similar genomic islands (GI), that had been identified in an in silico analysis of the PfAR-1 genome. A core fragment of 8-10 congruent genes with redox-related functions, present in each GI, was shown to confer allicin-specific resistance to P. syringae, and even to an unrelated E. coli strain. Transposon mutagenesis and overexpression analyses revealed the contribution of individual candidate genes to allicin-resistance. Moreover, PfAR-1 was unusual in having 3 glutathione reductase (glr) genes, two copies in two of the GIs, but outside of the core group, and one copy in the PfAR-1 genome. Glr activity was approximately 2-fold higher in PfAR-1 than in related susceptible Pf0-1, with only a single glr gene. Moreover, an E. coli {Delta}glr mutant showed increased susceptibility to allicin, which was complemented by PfAR-1 glr1. Taken together, our data support a multi-component resistance mechanism against allicin, achieved through horizontal gene transfer during coevolution, and allowing exploitation of the garlic ecological niche. GI regions syntenic with PfAR-1 GIs are present in other plant-associated bacterial species, perhaps suggesting a wider role in adaptation to plants per se.","Borlinghaus, J.; Bolger, A.; Schier, C.; Vogel, A.; Gruhlke, M.

Pseudomonas spp. are one of the most abundant bacterial genera in the soil and rhizosphere and play important roles in promoting plant health. However, the genetic determinants of this beneficial activity are only partially understood. Here, we genetically and phenotypically characterize the Pseudomonas fluorescens population in a commercial potato field, where we identify strong correlations between specialized metabolite biosynthesis and antagonism of the potato pathogens Streptomyces scabies and Phytophthora infestans. Genetic and chemical analyses identified hydrogen cyanide and cyclic lipopeptides as key specialized metabolites associated with S. scabies inhibition, which was supported by in planta biocontrol experiments. We show that a single potato field contains a hugely diverse and dynamic population of Pseudomonas bacteria, whose capacity to produce specialized metabolites is shaped both by plant colonization and defined environmental inputs.","Pacheco-Moreno, A.; Stefanato, F.

Here we address how spatial structure, through its effect on resource heterogeneity, alters diversification and adaptive evolution of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in an ecologically relevant context: soil-based compost. Our data show that environmental heterogeneity can both promote phenotypic diversification and accelerate adaptation.

Our results showed that highest removal percentage of PHE and PYR in contaminated soil as well as biomass of tall fescue were observed in GVPS. PHE and PYR accumulation by tall fescue roots were higher than shoots, the mycorrhizal status was best manifested in the roots of tall fescue inoculated with GVPS, and GVPS significantly increased the number of PGPR colonization in tall fescue rhizosphere soil. And paired-end Illumina HiSeq analysis of 16S rRNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene amplicons were also employed to study change of bacterial and fungal communities structure in four treatments. GVPS positively affected the speices and abundance of bacteria and fungi in PHE and PYR contaminated soil, an average of 71,144 high quality bacterial 16S rDNA tags and 102,455 ITS tags were obtained in GVPS, and all of them were assigned to 6,327 and 825 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 97% similarity, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum, Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum in all treatments, whereas Proteobacteria and Glomeromycota were the most prevalent bacterial and fungal phyla in GVPS, respectively. And in the generic level, Planctomyces is the richest bacterial genus, and Meyerozyma is the richest fungal genus in all treatments, whereas Sphingomona was the dominant bacterial genus, while the dominant fungi was Fusarium in GVPS.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2465,Pangenome-wide and molecular evolution analyses of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa species,"BackgroundDrug treatments and vaccine designs against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have multiple issues, all associated with the diverse genetic traits present in this pathogen, ranging from multi-drug resistant genes to the molecular machinery for the biosynthesis of biofilms. Several candidate vaccines against P. aeruginosa have been developed, which target the outer membrane proteins; however, major issues arise when attempting to establish complete protection against this pathogen due to its presumably genotypic variation at the strain level. To shed light on this concern, we proposed this study to assess the P. aeruginosa pangenome and its molecular evolution across multiple strains.\n\nResultsThe P. aeruginosa pangenome was estimated to contain more than 16,000 non-redundant genes, and approximately 15% of these constituted the core genome. Functional analyses of the accessory genome indicated a wide presence of genetic elements directly associated with pathogenicity. An in-depth molecular evolution analysis revealed the full landscape of selection forces acting on the P. aeruginosa pangenome, in which purifying selection drives evolution in the genome of this human pathogen. We also detected distinctive positive selection in a wide variety of outer membrane proteins, with the data supporting the concept of substantial genetic variation in proteins probably recognized as antigens. Approaching the evolutionary information of genes under extremely positive selection, we designed a new Multi-Locus Sequencing Typing assay for an informative, rapid, and cost-effective genotyping of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates.\n\nConclusionsWe report the unprecedented pangenome characterization of P. aeruginosa on a large scale, which included almost 200 bacterial genomes from one single species and a molecular evolutionary analysis at the pangenome scale. Evolutionary information presented here provides a clear explanation of the issues associated with the use of protein conjugates from pili, flagella, or secretion systems as antigens for vaccine design, which exhibit high genetic variation in terms of non-synonymous substitutions in P. aeruginosa strains.",Jeanneth Mosquera-Rendon;Ana M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,2478,Single Cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exhibit Electrotaxis and Durotaxis Behaviours,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently associated with nosocomial infections, including polymicrobial wound infections and the complex biofilm communities that reside within the cystic fibrosis lung. P. aeruginosa utilizes flagellum-mediated motility to approach, attach to, and spread across a surface using a combination of swimming, swarming and twitching (type IV pili extension and retraction) motility. We report an innovative approach to study the motility of single P. aeruginosa cells in microfluidic channels possessing different structural geometry, all with the flexibility of being able to manipulate stiffness gradients and electric fields to investigate changes in motility in response to specific stimuli. P. aeruginosa cells exhibit restricted motility in reduced microchannel spaces, with preferential migration toward a stiffer region in a rigidness gradient of substrate medium and preferential migration toward a positive electrode in presence of a pulsed or successive electric field. This single-cue environmental study using microfluidic technology lays the groundwork for multi-cue experimentation to more faithfully mimic conditions in vivo, demonstrating just some of the advantages of this technique.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,3202,Cationic Peptides Facilitate Iron-induced Mutagenesis in Bacteria,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative agent of chronic respiratory infections and is an important pathogen of cystic fibrosis patients. Adaptive mutations play an essential role for antimicrobial resistance and persistence. The factors that contribute to bacterial mutagenesis in this environment are not clear. Recently it has been proposed that cationic antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 could act as a mutagen in P. aeruginosa. Here we provide experimental evidence that mutagenesis is the product of a joint action of LL-37 and free iron. By estimating mutation rate, mutant frequencies and assessing mutational spectra in P. aeruginosa treated either with LL-37, iron or a combination of both we demonstrate that mutation rate and mutant frequency were increased only when free iron and LL-37 were present simultaneously. The addition of an iron chelator completely abolished this mutagenic effect, suggesting that LL-37 enables iron to enter the cells resulting in DNA damage by Fenton reactions. This was also supported by the observation that the mutational spectrum of the bacteria under LL-37-iron regime showed one of the characteristic Fenton reaction fingerprints: C to T transitions. Free iron concentration in nature and within hosts is kept at a very low level, but the situation in infected lungs of cystic fibrosis patients is different. Intermittent bleeding and damage to the epithelial cells in lungs may contribute to the release of free iron that in turn leads to generation of reactive oxygen species and deterioration of the respiratory tract, making it more susceptible to the infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryCationic antimicrobial peptides (cAMPs) are small proteins naturally produced by the immune system to limit bacterial growth mainly through pore formation in the membrane. It has recently been suggested that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs promote bacterial mutagenesis, similarly to antibiotics. However, we previously reported that cAMPs do not increase mutation rate and do not activate bacterial stress responses. Here we resolve this contradiction. We report that free iron in the culture medium increases mutagenesis in the presence of cAMPs. We show that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs facilitate entry of free iron into bacterial cells, where it interacts with hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species and increased mutagenesis. Moreover, these results may have clinically-relevant implications: while very little free iron is normally present in healthy individuals, this is not the case in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, where elevated bacterial mutagenesis promotes antibiotic resistance and contributes to persistence and severity of infection. Thus, an intervention aimed at reduction of free iron in the lungs could reduce the cAMPs-facilitation of iron-mediated mutagenesis; hence antibiotic resistance and pathoadaptation.",Alexandro Rodriguez-Rojas;Olga Makarova;Uta Mueller;Jens Rolff;,2015-09-03,Microbiology ,10.1101/026112,1,Alexandro  Rodriguez-Rojas,Free University of Berlin,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/026112v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/026112v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pgen.1005546

In post-hoc positive control analyses using curated knowledge, the P. aeruginosa ADAGE model found that co-operonic genes often participated in similar processes and accurately predicted which genes had similar functions. By analyzing newly generated data and previously published microarray and RNA-seq data, the ADAGE model identified gene expression differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes despite low level expression differences in directly involved genes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,3788,Dynamical Model of Drug Accumulation in Bacteria: Sensitivity Analysis and Experimentally Testable Predictions,"We present a dynamical model of drug accumulation in bacteria. The model captures key features in experimental time courses on ofloxacin accumulation: initial uptake; two-phase response; and long-term acclimation. In combination with experimental data, the model provides estimates of import and export rates in each phase, the time of entry into the second phase, and the decrease of internal drug during acclimation. Global sensitivity analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the model provide information about the robustness of these estimates, and about the relative importance of different parameters in determining the features of the accumulation time courses in three different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results lead to experimentally testable predictions of the effects of membrane permeability, drug efflux and trapping (e.g., by DNA binding) on drug accumulation. A key prediction is that a sudden increase in ofloxacin accumulation in both E. coli and S. aureus is accompanied by a decrease in membrane permeability.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacteria live or die depending on how much antibiotic gets inside them. Using a simple mathematical model, detailed information about drug import and export can be teased out of time courses of internal drug levels after a sudden exposure. The results suggest that membrane permeability can suddenly decrease during exposure to drug, accompanied by an increase, rather than a decrease, in the internal drug level.","Vesselinova, N.; Alexandrov, B.

The nucleotidyl cyclase toxin ExoY is a virulence factors injected by the pathogen and associated with severe damage to lung tissue. ExoY-like cyclases are also found in other Gram-negative pathogens and shown to contribute to virulence, although they remained poorly characterized. Here we demonstrate that filamentous actin (F-actin) is the hitherto unknown co-factor that activates P. aeruginosa ExoY within host target cells. Highly purified actin, when polymerized into filaments, potently stimulates (>10,000 fold) ExoY activity. ExoY co-localizes in vivo with actin filaments in transfected cells and, in vitro, it interferes with the regulation of actin assembly/disassembly-dynamics mediated by important F-actin-binding proteins. We further show that actin also activates an ExoY-like adenylate cyclase from a Vibrio species.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,4012,Exopolysaccharide biosynthetic glycoside hydrolases can be utilized to disrupt and prevent Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms,"Bacterial biofilms are a significant medical challenge as they are recalcitrant to current therapeutic regimes. A key component of biofilm formation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides Pel and Psl, which are involved in the formation and maintenance of the structural biofilm scaffold and protection against antimicrobials and host defenses. Given that the glycoside hydrolases - PelAh and PslGh - encoded in the pel and psl biosynthetic operons, respectively, are utilized for in vivo exopolysaccharide processing, we reasoned that these would provide specificity to target P. aeruginosa biofilms. Evaluating these enzymes as potential therapeutics, we demonstrate that these glycoside hydrolases selectively target and degrade the exopolysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix and that nanomolar concentrations of these enzymes can both prevent biofilm formation as well as rapidly disrupt preexisting biofilms in vitro. This treatment was effective against clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa isolates and reduced biofilm biomass by 58-94%.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,5556,Investigation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Soy Peptides by Developing a High Throughput Drug Screening Assay,"BackgroundAntimicrobial resistance is a great concern in the medical community, as well as food industry. Soy peptides were tested against bacterial biofilms for their antimicrobial activity. A high throughput drug screening assay was developed using microfluidic technology, RAMAN spectroscopy, and optical microscopy for rapid screening of antimicrobials and rapid identification of pathogens.\n\nMethodsSynthesized PGTAVFK and IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA soy peptides were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes using a microdilution assay. Microfluidic technology in combination with Surface Enhanced RAMAN Spectroscopy (SERS) and optical microscopy was used for rapid screening of soy peptides, pathogen identification, and to visualize the impact of selected peptides.\n\nResultsThe PGTAVFK peptide did not significantly affect P. aeruginosa, although it had an inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes above a concentration of 625 {micro}M. IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA was effective against both P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes above a concentration of 37.2 {micro}M. High throughput drug screening assays were able to reduce the screening and bacterial detection time to 4 h. SERS spectra was used to distinguish the two bacterial species.\n\nConclusionsPGTAVFK and IKAFKEATKVDKVVVLWTA soy peptides showed antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes. Development of high throughput assays could streamline the drug screening and bacterial detection process. General significance: The results of this study show that the antimicrobial properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of soy peptides could possibly make them an alternative to the ineffective antimicrobials and antibiotics currently used in the food and medical fields.

Wolbachia-mediated protection is associated with increased early expression of the antimicrobial peptide attacinA, followed by increased expression of a ROS detoxification gene (gstD8), and other tissue damage repair genes which together contribute to greater host resistance and disease tolerance. These results highlight that the route of infection is important for symbiont-mediated protection from infection, that Wolbachia can protect hosts by eliciting a combination of resistance and disease tolerance mechanisms, and that these effects are sexually dimorphic.",Radhakrishnan B Vasanthakrishnan;Gupta Vanika;Jonathon A Siva-Jothy;Katy M Monteith;Sam P Brown;Pedro F Vale;,2016-04-04,Microbiology ,10.1101/045757,2,Pedro F Vale,University of Edinburgh,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/045757v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/045757v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,6134,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PSL polysaccharide is a social but non-cheatable trait in biofilms,"Extracellular polysaccharides are compounds secreted by microorganisms into the surrounding environment and which are important for surface attachment and maintaining structural integrity within biofilms. The social nature of many extracellular polysaccharides remains unclear, and it has been suggested that they could function as either co-operative public goods, or as traits that provide a competitive advantage. Here we empirically test the co-operative nature of the PSL polysaccharide, which is crucial for the formation of biofilms in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that: (1) PSL is not metabolically costly to produce; (2) PSL provides population level benefits in biofilms, for both growth and antibiotic tolerance; (3) the benefits of PSL production are social and are shared with other cells; (4) the benefits of PSL production appear to be preferentially directed towards cells which produce PSL; (5) cells which do not produce PSL are unable to successfully exploit cells which produce PSL. Taken together, this suggests that PSL is a social but relatively non-exploitable trait, and that growth within biofilms selects for PSL-producing strains, even when multiple strains can interact (low relatedness).",Yasuhiko Irie;Aled Roberts;Kasper N Kragh;Vernita D Gordon;Jamie Hutchison;Rosalind J Allen;Gavin Melaugh;Thomas Bjarnsholt;Stuart A West;Stephen P Diggle;,2016-09-29,Microbiology ,10.1101/049783,6,Stephen P Diggle,University of Nottingham,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/049783v6?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/049783v6.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1128/mBio.00374-17
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,6496,Antibiotic Stress Selects against Cooperation in a Pathogenic Bacterium,"Ecological antagonisms such as predation, parasitism, competition, and abiotic environmental stress play key roles in shaping population biology, in particular by inducing stress responses and selecting for tolerant or resistant phenotypes. Little is known, however, about their impact on social traits, such as the production of public goods. Evolutionary trade-off theory predicts that adaptation to stresses should lessen investments in costly helping behaviours when cooperation does not increase resistance or tolerance, but support for this prediction is scarce. We employed theory and experiments to investigate how ecological antagonism influences social dynamics and resistance evolution in the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We subjected two clones of bacterium to four doses of antibiotics and assessed growth and frequencies of public goods producing and non-producing genotypes. Our results show that abiotic stress selects against public goods production. Specifically, we found that non-producers of costly iron chelating molecules (siderophores) most rapidly increased in frequency under intermediate antibiotic pressure. Moreover, the dominance of non-producers in mixed cultures was associated with higher survival and resistance to antibiotics than in either producer or non-producer monocultures. Mathematical modelling explains this counterintuitive result, and shows how these qualitative patterns are predicted to generalise to many other systems. Our results shed light on the complex interactions between social traits and ecological antagonisms, and in particular the consequences for bacterial social evolution and antibiotic resistance.",Marie Vasse;Robert Noble;Andrei R Akhmetzhanov;Clara Torres-Barceló;James Gurney;Simon Benateau;Claire Gougat-Barbera;Oliver Kaltz;Michael E Hochberg;,2016-05-12,Microbiology ,10.1101/053066,1,Michael E Hochberg,University of Montpellier,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/053066v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/053066v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1073/pnas.1612522114
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,6598,Environmental modification via a quorum sensing molecule influences the social landscape of siderophore production,"Bacteria produce a wide variety of exoproducts that favourably modify their environment and increase their fitness. These are often termed  public goods because they are costly for individuals to produce and can be exploited by non-producers ( cheats). The outcome of conflict over public goods is dependent upon the prevailing environment and the phenotype of the individuals in competition. Many bacterial species use quorum sensing (QS) signalling molecules to regulate the production of public goods. QS therefore determines the cooperative phenotype of individuals, and influences conflict over public goods. In addition to their regulatory functions, many QS molecules have additional properties that directly modify the prevailing environment. This leads to the possibility that QS molecules could influence conflict over public goods indirectly through non-signalling effects, and the impact of this on social competition has not previously been explored. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS signal molecule PQS is a powerful chelator of iron which can cause an iron starvation response. Here we show that PQS stimulates a concentration-dependent increase in the cooperative production of iron scavenging siderophores, resulting in an increase in the relative fitness of non-producing siderophore cheats. This is likely due to an increased cost of siderophore output by producing cells and a concurrent increase in the shared benefits, which accrue to both producers and cheats. Although PQS can be a beneficial signalling molecule for P.aeruginosa, our data suggests that it can also render a siderophore-producing population vulnerable to competition from cheating strains. More generally our results indicate that the production of one social trait can indirectly affect the costs and benefits of another social trait.","Popat, R.; Harrison, F.; Da Silva, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,7480,When is a bacterial &quot;virulence factor&quot; really virulent?,"Bacterial traits that contribute to disease are termed  virulence factors and there is much interest in therapeutic approaches that disrupt such traits. However, ecological theory predicts disease severity to be multifactorial and context dependent, which might complicate our efforts to identify the most generally important virulence factors. Here, we use meta-analysis to quantify disease outcomes associated with one well-studied virulence factor - pyoverdine, an iron-scavenging compound secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Consistent with ecological theory, we found that the effect of pyoverdine, albeit frequently contributing to disease, varied considerably across infection models. In many cases its effect was relatively minor, suggesting that pyoverdine is rarely essential for infections. Our work demonstrates the utility of meta-analysis as a tool to quantify variation and overall effects of purported virulence factors across different infection models. This standardised approach will help us to evaluate promising targets for anti-virulence approaches.",Elisa T Granato;Freya Harrison;Rolf Kümmerli;Adin Ross-Gillespie;,2016-06-29,Microbiology ,10.1101/061317,1,Elisa T Granato,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/061317v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/061317v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01952
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,7635,Manipulating virulence factor availability can have complex consequences for infections,"Given the rise of bacterial resistance against antibiotics, we urgently need alternative strategies to fight infections. Some propose we should disarm rather than kill bacteria, through targeted disruption of their virulence factors. It is assumed that this approach (i) induces weak selection for resistance because it should only minimally impact bacterial fitness, and (ii) is specific, only interfering with the virulence factor in question. Given that pathogenicity emerges from complex interactions between pathogens, hosts, and their environment, such assumptions may be unrealistic. To address this issue in a test case, we conducted experiments with the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where we manipulated the availability of a virulence factor, the iron-scavenging pyoverdine, within the insect host Galleria mellonella. We observed that pyoverdine availability was not stringently predictive of virulence, and affected bacterial fitness in non-linear ways. We show that this complexity could partly arise because pyoverdine availability affects host responses and alters the expression of regulatorily linked virulence factors. Our results reveal that virulence-factor manipulation feeds back on pathogen and host behavior, which in turn affects virulence. Our findings highlight that realizing effective and evolutionarily robust anti-virulence therapies will ultimately require deeper engagement with the intrinsic complexity of host-pathogen systems.",Michael Weigert;Adin Ross-Gillespie;Anne Leinweber;Gabriella Pessi;Sam P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,8156,"Small molecules with antibiofilm, antivirulence and antibiotic synergy activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Biofilm formation is a universal bacterial strategy for long-term survival in nature and during infections. Biofilms are dense microbial communities enmeshed within a polymeric extracellular matrix that protects bacteria from antibiotic exposure and the immune system and thus contribute to chronic infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an archetypal biofilm-forming organism that utilizes a biofilm growth strategy to cause chronic lung infections in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients. The extracellular matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms is comprised mainly of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and DNA. Both mucoid and non-mucoid isolates of P. aeruginosa produces the Pel and Psl EPS, each of which have important roles in antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation and immune evasion. Given the central importance of the Pel and Psl EPS in biofilm structure, they are attractive targets for novel anti-infective compounds. In this study we used a high throughput gene expression screen to identify compounds that repress expression of pel and psl genes as measured by transcriptional lux fusions. Testing of the pel/psl repressors demonstrated an antibiofilm activity against microplate and flow chamber biofilms formed by wild type and hyperbiofilm forming strains. To determine the potential role of EPS in virulence, mutants in pel/psl were shown to have reduced virulence in the feeding behavior and slow killing virulence assays in Caenorhabditis elegans. The antibiofilm molecules also reduced P. aeruginosa PAO1 virulence in the nematode slow killing model. Importantly, the combination of antibiotics and antibiofilm compounds were synergistic in killing P. aeruginosa biofilms. These small molecules represent a novel anti-infective strategy for the possible treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa infections.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria use the strategy of growing as a biofilm to promote long-term survival and therefore to cause chronic infections. One of the best examples is Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the chronic lung infections in individuals with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Biofilms are generally a dense community of bacteria enmeshed in an extracellular matrix that protects bacteria from numerous environmental stresses, including antibiotics and the immune system. In this study we developed an approach to identify P. aeruginosa biofilm inhibitors by repressing the production of the matrix exopolysaccharide (EPS) polymers. Bacteria treated with compounds and then fed to the nematode also had showed reduced virulence by promoting nematode survival. To tackle the problem of biofilm tolerance of antibiotics, the compounds identified here also had the beneficial property of increasing the biofilm sensitivity to different classes of antibiotics. The compounds disarm bacteria but they do not kill or limit growth like antibiotics. We provide further support that disarming P. aeruginosa may be a critical anti-infective strategy that limits the development of antibiotic resistance, and provides a new way for treating chronic infections.",Erik Van Tilburg Bernardes;Laetitia Charron-Mazenod;David Reading;Shauna L Reckseidler-Zenteno;Shawn Lewenza;,2016-08-01,Microbiology ,10.1101/067074,1,Shawn  Lewenza,Athabasca University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/067074v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/067074v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1128/aac.01997-16

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,8948,High-throughput detection of RNA processing in bacteria,"BackgroundUnderstanding the RNA processing of an organism's transcriptome is an essential but challenging step in understanding its biology. Here we investigate with unprecedented detail the transcriptome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, a medically important and innately multi-drug resistant bacterium. We systematically mapped RNA cleavage and dephosphorylation sites that result in 5'-monophosphate terminated RNA using a new high-throughput methodology called monophosphate RNA-Seq (pRNA-Seq). Transcriptional start sites (TSS) were also mapped using differential RNA-Seq (dRNA-Seq) and both datasets were compared to conventional RNA-Seq performed in a variety of growth conditions.\n\nResultsThe pRNA-Seq transcript library revealed known tRNA, rRNA and tmRNA processing sites, together with previously uncharacterized RNA cleavage events that were found disproportionately near the 5' ends of transcripts associated with basic bacterial functions such as oxidative phosphorylation and purine metabolism. The majority (97%) of the processed mRNAs were cleaved at precise codon positions within defined sequence motifs indicative of distinct endonucleolytic activities. The most abundant of these motifs corresponded closely to an E. coli RNase E site previously established in vitro. Using the dRNA-Seq library, we performed an operon analysis and predicted 3,159 potential TSS. A correlation analysis uncovered 105 antiparallel pairs of TSS that were separated by 18 bp from each other and that were centered on a palindromic TAT(A/T)ATA motif, suggesting that such sites may provide a novel form of transcriptional regulation. TSS and RNA-Seq analysis allowed us to confirm expression of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which are differentially expressed in swarming and biofilm formation conditions.\n\nConclusionsThis study introduces pRNA-Seq methodology, which provides the first comprehensive, genome-wide survey of RNA processing in any organism. As a proof of concept, we have employed this technique to study the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and have discovered extensive transcript processing not previously appreciated.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,9346,Flow environment and matrix structure interact to determine spatial competition in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms,"Bacteria often live in biofilms, which are microbial communities surrounded by a secreted extracellular matrix. Here, we demonstrate that hydrodynamic flow and matrix organization interact to shape competitive dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Irrespective of initial frequency, in competition with matrix mutants, wild type cells always increase in relative abundance in straight-tunnel microfluidic devices under simple flow regimes. By contrast, in microenvironments with complex, irregular flow profiles - which are common in natural environments - wild type matrix-producing and isogenic non-producing strains can coexist. This result stems from local obstruction of flow by wild-type matrix producers, which generates regions of near-zero flow speed that allow matrix mutants to locally accumulate. Our findings connect the evolutionary stability of matrix production with the hydrodynamics and spatial structure of the surrounding environment, providing a potential explanation for the variation in biofilm matrix secretion observed among bacteria in natural environments.\n\nImpact StatementThe feedback between hydrodynamic flow conditions and biofilm spatial architecture drives competition in P. aeruginosa biofilms, and can explain the variation in biofilm production observed among bacteria in natural environments.",Carey Nadell;Deirdre Ricaurte;Jing Yan;Knut Drescher;Bonnie Bassler;,2016-10-07,Microbiology ,10.1101/077354,2,Bonnie  Bassler,Princeton University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/077354v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/077354v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.7554/eLife.21855
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,9366,Managing Uncertainty in Metabolic Network Structure and Improving Predictions Using EnsembleFBA,"Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are repositories of knowledge about the metabolic processes that occur in an organism. GENREs have been used to discover and interpret metabolic functions, and to engineer novel network structures. A major barrier preventing more widespread use of GENREs, particularly to study non-model organisms, is the extensive time required to produce a high-quality GENRE. Many automated approaches have been developed which reduce this time requirement, but automatically-reconstructed draft GENREs still require curation before useful predictions can be made. We present a novel ensemble approach to the analysis of GENREs which improves the predictive capabilities of draft GENREs and is compatible with many automated reconstruction approaches. We refer to this new approach as Ensemble Flux Balance Analysis (EnsembleFBA). We validate EnsembleFBA by predicting growth and gene essentiality in the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa UCBPP-PA14. We demonstrate how EnsembleFBA can be included in a systems biology workflow by predicting essential genes in six Streptococcus species and mapping the essential genes to small molecule ligands from DrugBank. We found that some metabolic subsystems contribute disproportionately to the set of predicted essential reactions in a way that is unique to each Streptococcus species. These species-specific network structures lead to species-specific outcomes from small molecule interactions. Through these analyses of P. aeruginosa and six Streptococci, we show that ensembles increase the quality of predictions without drastically increasing reconstruction time, thus making GENRE approaches more practical for applications which require predictions for many non-model organisms. All of our functions and accompanying example code are available in an open online repository.\n\nAuthor SummaryMetabolism is the driving force behind all biological activity. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are representations of metabolic systems that can be analyzed mathematically to make predictions about how a biochemical system will behave as well as to design biochemical systems with new properties. GENREs have traditionally been reconstructed manually, which can require extensive time and effort. Recent software solutions automate the process (drastically reducing the required effort) but the resulting GENREs are of lower quality and produce less reliable predictions than the manually-curated versions. We present a novel method (\""EnsembleFBA\"") which overcomes uncertainties involved in automated reconstruction by pooling many different draft GENREs together into an ensemble. We tested EnsembleFBA by predicting the growth and essential genes of the common pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that when predicting growth or essential genes, ensembles of GENREs achieved much better precision or captured many more essential genes than any of the individual GENREs within the ensemble. By improving the predictions that can be made with automatically-generated GENREs, we open the door to studying systems which would otherwise be infeasible.",Matthew Biggs;Jason A Papin;,2016-09-26,Systems Biology ,10.1101/077636,1,Jason A Papin,University of Virginia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/077636v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/077636v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005413
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,9526,Unsupervised extraction of stable expression signatures from public compendia with eADAGE,"Cross experiment comparisons in public data compendia are challenged by unmatched conditions and technical noise. The ADAGE method, which performs unsupervised integration with neural networks, can effectively identify biological patterns, but because ADAGE models, like many neural networks, are over-parameterized, different ADAGE models perform equally well. To enhance model robustness and better build signatures consistent with biological pathways, we developed an ensemble ADAGE (eADAGE) that integrated stable signatures across models. We applied eADAGE to a Pseudomonas aeruginosa compendium containing experiments performed in 78 media. eADAGE revealed a phosphate starvation response controlled by PhoB.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,9783,Rapid and consistent evolution of colistin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during morbidostat culture,"Colistin is a last resort antibiotic commonly used against multidrug-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate the potential for in-situ evolution of resistance against colistin and map the molecular targets of colistin resistance, we exposed two P. aeruginosa isolates to colistin using a continuous culture device known as morbidostat. Colistin resistance emerged within two weeks along with highly stereotypic yet strain specific mutation patterns. The majority of mutations hit the prmAB two component signaling system and genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis, including lpxC, pmrE, and migA. In seven out of 18 cultures, we observed mutations in mutS along with a mutator phenotype that seemed to facilitate resistance evolution.","Regenbogen, B.; Willmann, M.; Steglich, M.; Bunk, B.; Nubel, U.; Peter, S.; Neher, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,9938,The fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing signal cheats is influenced by the diffusivity of the environment,"Experiments examining the social dynamics of bacterial quorum sensing (QS) have focused on mutants which do not respond to signals, and the role of QS-regulated exoproducts as public goods. The potential for QS signal molecules to themselves be social public goods has received much less attention. Here, we analyse how signal-deficient (lasI-) mutants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa interact with wild-type cells in an environment where QS is required for growth. We show that when growth requires a  private intracellular metabolic mechanism activated by the presence of QS signal, lasI- mutants act as social cheats and outcompete signal-producing wild-type bacteria in mixed cultures, because they can use the signals produced by wild type cells. However, reducing the ability of signal molecules to diffuse through the growth medium, results in signal molecules becoming less accessible to mutants, leading to reduced cheating. Our results indicate that QS signal molecules can be considered as social public goods in a way that has been previously described for other exoproducts, but that spatial structuring of populations reduces exploitation by non-cooperative signal cheats.\n\nImportanceBacteria communicate via signaling molecules to regulate the expression of a whole range of genes. This process, termed quorum sensing (QS), moderates bacterial metabolism in many environmental conditions, from soil and water (where QS-regulated genes influence nutrient cycling) to animal hosts (where QS-regulated genes determine pathogen virulence). Understanding the ecology of QS could therefore yield vital clues as to how we might modify bacterial behaviour for environmental or clinical gains. Here, we demonstrate that QS signals act as shareable public goods. This means that their evolution, and therefore population-level responses to interference with QS, will be constrained by population structure. Further, we show that environmental structure (constraints on signal diffusion) alters the accessibility of QS signals and demonstrates that we need to consider population and environmental structure to help us further our understanding of QS signaling systems.","Mund, A.; Diggle, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10622,Electroceutical disinfection strategies impair the motility of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli,"Electrotaxis or galvanotaxis refers to the migration pattern of cells induced in response to electrical potential. Although it has been extensively studied in mammalian cells, electrotaxis has not been explored in detail in bacterial cells; information regarding the impact of current on pathogenic bacteria is severely lacking. Therefore, we designed a series of single and multi-cue experiments to assess the impact of varying currents on bacterial motility dynamics in pathogenic multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli using a microfluidic platform. Motility plays key roles in bacterial migration and the colonization of surfaces during the formation of biofilms, which are inherently recalcitrant to removal and resistant to traditional disinfection strategies (e.g. antibiotics). Use of the microfluidic platform allows for exposure to current, which can be supplied at a range that is biocidal to bacteria, yet physiologically safe in humans (single cue). This system also allows for multi-cue experiments where acetic acid, a relatively safe compound with anti-fouling/antimicrobial properties, can be combined with current to enhance disinfection. These strategies may offer substantial therapeutic benefits, specifically for the treatment of biofilm infections, such as those found in the wound environment. Furthermore, microfluidic systems have been successfully used to model the unique microfluidic dynamics present in the wound environment, suggesting that these investigations could be extended to more complex biological systems. Our results showed that the application of current in combination with acetic acid has profound inhibitory effects on MDR strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli, even with brief applications. Specifically, E. coli motility dynamics and cell survival were significantly impaired starting at a concentration of 125 A DC and 0.31% acetic acid, while P. aeruginosa was impaired at 70 A and 0.31% acetic acid. As these strains are relevant wound pathogens, it is likely that this strategy would be effective against similar strains in vivo and could represent a new approach to hasten wound healing.","Doxsee, K.; Berthelot, R.; Neethirajan, S.",2016-11-16,Bioengineering,10.1101/088120,1,Suresh  Neethirajan,University of Guelph,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088120v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/088120v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/mi8070207
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10785,History of Antibiotic Adaptation Influences Microbial Evolutionary Dynamics During Subsequent Treatment,"Antibiotic regimens often include the sequential changing of drugs to limit development and evolution of resistance of bacterial pathogens. It remains unclear how history of adaptation to one antibiotic can influence the resistance profiles when bacteria subsequently adapt to a different antibiotic. Here, we experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa to six two-drug sequences. We observed drug order-specific effects whereby: adaptation to the first drug can limit subsequent adaptation to the second drug, adaptation to the second drug can restore susceptibility to the first drug, or final resistance levels depend on the order of the two-drug sequence. These findings demonstrate how resistance not only depends on the current drug regimen but also history of past regimens. These order-specific effects have profound clinical implications and provide support for the need to consider history of past drug exposure when designing strategies to mitigate resistance and combat bacterial infections.","Yen, P.; Papin, J.",2016-11-23,Systems Biology,10.1101/089334,1,Jason  Papin,University of Virginia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/089334v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/089334v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pbio.2001586
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,10822,Heat-stable preservation of protein expression systems for portable therapeutics production,"Many biotechnology capabilities are limited by stringent storage needs of reagents, largely prohibiting use outside of specialized laboratories. Focusing on a large class of protein-based biotechnology applications, we address this issue by developing a method for preserving cell-free protein expression systems under months of heat stress. Our approach realizes an unprecedented degree of long term heat stability by leveraging the sugar alcohol trehalose, a simple, low-cost, open-air drying step, and strategic separation of sets of reaction components during drying. The resulting preservation capacity opens the door for efficient production of a wide range of on-demand proteins under adverse conditions, for instance during emergency outbreaks or in remote or otherwise inaccessible locations. As such, our preservation method stands to advance a great number of different cell-free technologies, including remediation efforts, point of care therapeutics, and large-scale biosensing. To demonstrate this application potential, we use cell-free reagents subjected to months of heat stress and atmospheric conditions to produce sufficient concentrations of a pyocin protein to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most troublesome pathogens for traumatic and burn wound injuries. Our work makes possible new biotechnology applications that demand both ruggedness and scalability.","Karig, D.; Bessling, S.; Thielen, P.; Zhang, S.; Wolfe, J.",2016-11-26,Synthetic Biology,10.1101/089664,1,David  Karig,Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/089664v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/089664v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1098/rsif.2016.1039
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11026,Genome-wide survey of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 reveals a role for the glyoxylate pathway and extracellular proteases in the limited utilization of mucin,"Chronic airway infections by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are major cause of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. While this bacterium has been extensively studied for its virulence mechanisms, biofilm growth and immune evasion within the CF airways, comparatively little is known about the nutrient sources that sustain its growth in vivo. Respiratory mucins represent a potentially abundant bioavailable nutrient source, though we have recently shown that canonical pathogens inefficiently use these host glycoproteins as a growth substrate. Yet, given that P. aeruginosa, particularly in its biofilm mode of growth is thought to grow slowly in vivo, the inefficient use of mucin glycoproteins may have relevance to its persistence within the CF airways. To this end, here we use whole genome fitness analysis combining transposon mutagenesis with high throughput sequencing (TnSeq) to identify genetic determinants required for P. aeruginosa growth using intact purified mucins as a sole carbon source. Our analysis reveals a biphasic growth phenotype, during which the glyoxylate pathway and amino acid biosynthetic machinery are required for mucin utilization. Secondary analyses confirmed the simultaneous liberation and consumption of acetate during mucin degradation and revealed a central role for the extracellular proteases LasB and AprA. Together, these studies identified the P. aeruginosa genes required for mucin-based nutrient acquisition and reveal a host-pathogen dynamic that may contribute to its persistence within the CF airways.","Flynn, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11360,Individual- versus group-optimality in the production of secreted bacterial compounds,"How unicellular organisms optimize the production of compounds is a fundamental biological question. While it is typically thought that production is optimized at the individual-cell level, secreted compounds could also allow for optimization at the group level, leading to a division of labor where a subset of cells produces and shares the compound with everyone. Using mathematical modelling, we show that the evolution of such division of labor depends on the cost function of compound production. Specifically, for any trait with saturating benefits, linear costs promote the evolution of uniform production levels across cells. Conversely, production costs that diminish with higher output levels favor the evolution of specialization - especially when compound shareability is high. When experimentally testing these predictions with pyoverdine, a secreted iron-scavenging compound produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we found linear costs and, consistent with our model, detected uniform pyoverdine production levels across cells. We conclude that for shared compounds with saturating benefits, the evolution of division of labor is facilitated by a diminishing cost function. More generally, we note that shifts in the level of selection from individuals to groups do not solely require cooperation, but critically depend on mechanistic factors, including the distribution of compound synthesis costs.","Schiessl, K.; Ross-Gillespie, A.; Cornforth, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11379,Magnitude and mechanism of siderophore-mediated competition in bacterial interactions,"Whether microbial interactions are predominantly cooperative or competitive is a central question in microbial ecology, and determines the composition and stability of microbial communities. The secretion of iron chelators called siderophores is a model system for cooperative interactions, even though these chelators can also mediate competition by depriving competitors of iron. Using a genetically engineered experimental system based on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa siderophore pyochelin, we found that secreting siderophores to inhibit a competitor can lead to higher benefits than secreting siderophores to make iron available. Based on thermodynamic modeling, we propose that competitive inhibition by siderophores is efficient in kinetically controlled saturated systems, where dissolution of precipitated iron phases is slow. Under these conditions, met in many natural environments, secreted siderophores temporarily reduce the concentration of available iron and can thus induce growth inhibition in a competing strain, even at high iron concentrations. These findings give insight into the function of siderophores: In addition to its cooperative nature, siderophore secretion could also be a widespread mechanism for mediating competitive interactions. Our functional investigation reveals a complexity in microbial interaction networks that would remain hidden when focusing on genomic information alone.","Schiessl, K.; Janssen, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11520,The social evolution of siderophore production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is environmentally determined.,"Bacteria secrete various exoproducts whose benefits can be shared by all cells in the vicinity. The potential importance of these \""public goods\"" in bacterial evolutionary ecology has been extensively studied. Cheating by siderophore-null mutants of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has received particular attention. The potential of siderophore mutants to attenuate virulence, and the possibility of exploiting this for clinical ends, have generated a wealth of publications. However, the possibility that genotype {middle dot} environment interactions govern the evolutionary consequences of siderophore loss has been almost entirely ignored. A review of the available literature revealed (i) widespread use of an undefined mutant as a siderophore cheat; and (ii) a reliance on experiments conducted in iron-limited minimal medium. Whole genome sequencing of the undefined mutant revealed a range of mutations affecting phenotypes other than siderophore production. We then conducted cheating assays using defined deletion mutants, grown in conditions designed to model infected fluids and tissue in CF lung infection and non-healing wounds. Depending on the environment, we found that siderophore loss could lead to cheating, simple fitness defects, or no fitness effect at all. It is therefore crucial to develop appropriate in vitro growth conditions in order to better predict the social evolution of traits in vivo.","Harrison, F.; Mcnally, A.; Da Silva, A. C.; Diggle, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11974,Cyclic-di-GMP is required for corneal infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and modulates host immunity,"Biofilms are extremely tolerant toward antimicrobial treatment and host immune clearance due to their distinct physiology and protection by extracellular polymeric substances. Bis-(3{acute}-5{acute})-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is an essential messenger that regulates biofilm formation by a wide range of bacteria. However, there is a lack of physiological characterization of biofilms in vivo as well as the roles of c-di-GMP signaling in mediating host-biofilm interactions. Here, we employed dual RNA-Seq to characterize the host and pathogen transcriptomes during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection using a mouse keratitis model. In vivo P. aeruginosa biofilms maintained a distinct physiology compared with in vitro P. aeruginosa biofilms, with enhanced virulence and iron uptake capacity. C-di-GMP synthesis was enhanced in P. aeruginosa cells in vivo, potentially due to down-regulation of the expression of several phosphodiesterases (e.g., DipA, NbdA). Increased intracellular c-di-GMP levels were required for long-term ocular colonization of P. aeruginosa and impaired host innate immunity.","Yam, J. K. H.; Aung, T. T.; Chua, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,11992,Epidemiological and ecological modelling reveal diversity in microbial population structures from a cross-sectional community swabbing study,"Respiratory tract infections (RTI) are responsible for over 4 million deaths per year worldwide with pathobiont carriage a required precursor to infection. Through a cross-sectional community-based nasal self-swabbing study we sought to determine carriage epidemiology for respiratory pathogens amongst bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria meningitidis) and viruses (RSV, Influenza viruses A and B, Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Coronavirus, Parainfluenza viruses 1-3 and Adenovirus (ADV)). Carriage of bacterial and viral species was shown to vary with participant age, recent RTI and the presence of other species. The spatial structure of microbial respiratory communities was less nested (more disordered) in the young (0-4 years) and those with recent RTI. Species frequency distributions were flatter than random expectation in young individuals (X2 = 20.42, p = 0.002), indicating spatial clumping of species consistent with facilitative relationships amongst them. Deviations from a neutral model of ecological niches were observed for samples collected in the summer and from older individuals (those aged 5-17, 18-64 and [&ge;]65 years) but not in samples collected from winter, younger individuals (those aged 0-4 years), individuals with recent RTI and individuals without recent RTI, demonstrating the importance of both neutral and niche processes in respiratory community assembly.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,13864,Microbial glycoside hydrolases as antibiofilm agents with cross-kingdom activity,"Galactosaminogalactan and Pel are cationic heteropolysaccharides produced by the opportunistic pathogens, Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. These exopolysaccharides both contain 1,4-linked N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and play an important role in biofilm formation by these organisms. Proteins containing glycoside hydrolase domains have recently been identified within the biosynthetic pathway of each exopolysaccharide. Recombinant hydrolase domains from these proteins (Sph3h from A. fumigatus and PelAh from P. aeruginosa) were found to degrade their respective polysaccharides in vitro. We therefore hypothesized that these glycoside hydrolases could exhibit anti-biofilm activity, and further, given the chemical similarity between galactosaminogalactan and Pel, that they might display cross-species activity. Treatment of A. fumigatus with Sph3h disrupted A. fumigatus biofilms with an EC50 of 0.4 nM. PelAh treatment also disrupted pre-formed A. fumigatus biofilms with EC50 values similar to those obtained for Sph3h. In contrast, Sph3h was unable to disrupt P. aeruginosa Pel-based biofilms, despite being able to bind to the exopolysaccharide. Treatment of A. fumigatus hyphae with either Sph3h or PelAh significantly enhanced the activity of the antifungals posaconazole, amphotericin B and caspofungin, likely through increasing antifungal penetration of hyphae. Both enzymes were non-cytotoxic and protected A549 pulmonary epithelial cells from A. fumigatus-induced cell damage for up to 24 hours. Intratracheal administration of Sph3h was well tolerated, and reduced pulmonary fungal burden in a neutropenic mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. These findings suggest that glycoside hydrolases can exhibit activity against diverse microorganisms and may be useful as therapeutic agents by degrading biofilms and attenuating virulence.\n\nSignificanceThe production of biofilms is an important strategy used by both bacteria and fungi to colonize surfaces and to enhance resistance to killing by immune cells and antimicrobial agents. We demonstrate that glycoside hydrolases derived from the opportunistic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus and Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be exploited to disrupt pre-formed fungal biofilms and reduce virulence. Additionally, these glycoside hydrolases can be utilized to potentiate antifungal drugs by increasing their hyphal penetration, to protect human cells from fungal-induced injury and to attenuate virulence of A. fumigatus in a mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. The findings of this study identify recombinant microbial glycoside hydrolases as promising therapeutics with the potential for anti-biofilm activity against pathogens across different taxonomic kingdoms.","Snarr, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,14304,cAMP-Independent Control Of Twitching Motility In Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"FimV is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane hub protein that modulates levels of the second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), through activation of the adenylate cyclase, CyaB. Although type IVa pilus (T4aP)-dependent twitching motility is modulated by cAMP levels, mutants lacking FimV are twitching impaired, even when exogenous cAMP is provided. Here we further define FimVs cAMP-dependent and -independent regulation of twitching. We confirmed that the response regulator of the T4aP-associated Chp chemotaxis system, PilG, required both FimV and the CyaB regulator, FimL, to activate CyaB. However, in cAMP-replete backgrounds - lacking the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA or the CheY-like protein PilH, or expressing constitutively-active CyaB - pilG and fimV mutants failed to twitch. Both cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains of FimV were important for its cAMP-dependent and -independent roles, while its septal peptidoglycan-targeting LysM motif was required only for twitching motility. Polar localization of the sensor kinase PilS, a key regulator of transcription of the major pilin, was FimV-dependent. However, unlike its homologues in other species that localize flagellar system components, FimV was not required for swimming motility. These data provide further evidence to support FimVs role as a key hub protein that coordinates the polar localization and function of multiple structural and regulatory proteins involved in P. aeruginosa twitching motility.\n\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious opportunistic pathogen. Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important for its virulence, because they mediate dissemination and invasion via twitching motility, and are involved in surface sensing which modulates pathogenicity via changes in cAMP levels. Here we show that the hub protein FimV and the response regulator of the Chp system, PilG, regulate twitching independently of their roles in modulation of cAMP synthesis. These functions do not require the putative scaffold protein FimL, proposed to link PilG with FimV. PilG may regulate asymmetric functioning of the T4aP system to allow for directional movement, while FimV appears to localize both structural and regulatory elements - including the PilSR two-component system - to cell poles for optimal function.","Buensuceso, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,14544,Divergent In vitro MIC Characteristics and underlying isogenic mutations in host-specialized Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are known to differ from those associated with infections of non-CF hosts in colony morphology, drug susceptibility patterns, and genomic hypermutability. Although Pa isolates from CF have long been recognized for their overall higher resistance rate calculated generally by reduced \""percent susceptible\"", this study takes the approach to compare and contrast Etest MIC distributions between two distinct cohorts of clinical strains (n=224 from 56 CF patients and n=130 from 68 non-CF patients respectively) isolated in 2013. Logarithmic transformed MIC (logMIC) values of 11 antimicrobial agents were compared between the two groups. CF isolates tended to produce heterogeneous and widely dispersed MICs compared to non-CF isolates. By applying a test for equality of variances, we were able to confirm that the MICs generated from CF isolates against 9 out of the 11 agents were significantly more dispersed than those from non-CF (p<0.02-<0.001). Quantile-quantiles plots indicated little agreement between the two cohorts of isolates. Based on whole genome sequencing of 19 representative CF Pa isolates, divergent gain- or loss-of-function mutations in efflux and porin genes and their regulators between isogenic or intra-clonal associates were evident. Not one, not a few, but the net effect all adaptive mutational changes in the genomes of CF Pa, both shared and unshared between isogenic strains, are responsible for the divergent heteroresistance patterns. Moreover, the isogenic variations are suggestive of a bacterial syntrophic lifestyle when \""lockedo inside a host focal airway environment over prolonged periods.\n\nSignificance statementBacterial heteroresistance is associated with niche specialized organisms interacting with host species for prolonged period of time, medically characterized by \""chronic focal infections\"". A prime example is found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isogenic/non-homogeneous isolates from patient airways with cystic fibrosis. The development of pseudomonal polarizing MICs in vitro to many actively used antimicrobial agents among isogenic isolates and \""Eagle-type\"" heteroresistance patterns are common and characteristic. Widespread isogenic gene lesions were evident for defects in drug transporters, DNA mismatch repair, and many other structural or cellular functions--a result of pseudomonal symbiotic response to host selection. Co-isolation of extremely susceptible and resistant isogenic Pa strains suggests intra-airway evolution of a multicellular syntrophic bacterial lifestyle, which has laboratory interpretation and clinical treatment implications.","Qin, X.; Greninger, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,14456,Cheating on cheaters dramatically affects social interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacterial cooperation can be disrupted by non-producers, which can profit from public goods without paying their production cost. A cheater can increase in frequency, exhausting the public good and causing a population collapse. Here we investigate how interactions among two cheaters for distinct social traits influence the short and long-term dynamics of polymorphic populations. Using as a model Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its extensively studied social traits, production of the siderophore pyoverdine and the quorum sensing regulated elastase, we analyzed the social dynamics of polymorphic populations under conditions where the two traits are required for optimal growth. We show that cheaters for either trait compete with both the wild type and each other, and that mutants for pyoverdine production can prevent a drastic population collapse caused by quorum sensing cheaters. A simple mathematical model suggests that the observed social dynamics are determined by the ratio of the costs of each social trait, such that the mutant which avoids paying the highest cost dominates the population. Finally, we demonstrate how quorum sensing regulation can avoid the full loss of cooperation.","Özkaya, O.; Balbontin, R.; Gordo, I.; Xavier, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,14556,The physical boundaries of public goods cooperation between surface-attached bacterial cells,"Bacteria secrete a variety of compounds important for nutrient scavenging, competition mediation and infection establishment. While there is a general consensus that secreted compounds can be shared and therefore have social consequences for the bacterial collective, we know little about the physical limits of such bacterial social interactions. Here, we address this issue by studying the sharing of iron-scavenging siderophores between surface-attached microcolonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using single-cell fluorescent microscopy, we show that siderophores, secreted by producers, quickly reach non-producers within a range of 100 m, and significantly boost their fitness. Producers in turn respond to variation in sharing efficiency by adjusting their pyoverdine investment levels. These social effects wane with larger cell-to-cell distances and on hard surfaces. Thus, our findings reveal the boundaries of compound sharing, and show that sharing is particularly relevant between nearby yet physically separated bacteria on soft surfaces, matching realistic natural conditions such as those encountered in soft tissue infections.","Weigert, M.; Kümmerli, R.",2017-06-14,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/119032,2,Michael  Weigert,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/119032v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/119032v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1098/rspb.2017.0631
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,14876,Interaction of N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone with transcriptional regulator LasR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Insights from molecular docking and dynamics simulations,"BackgroundIn 2017 World Health Organization announced the list of the most dangerous superbugs and among them is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is an antibiotic resistant opportunistic human pathogen as well as one of the  SKAPE pathogens. The central problem is that it affects patients suffering from AIDS, cystic fibrosis, cancer, burn victims etc. P. aeruginosa creates and inhabits surface-associated biofilms. Biofilms increase resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses, because of those current treatments are not effective. It is imperative to find new antibacterial treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa, but detailed molecular properties of the LasR protein are not clearly known to date. In the present study, we tried to analyse the molecular properties of the LasR protein as well as the mode of its interactions with autoinducer (AI) the N-3-oxododecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-0-C12-HSL).\n\nResultsWe performed docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the LasR protein of P. aeruginosa with the 3-0-C12-HSL ligand. We assessed the conformational changes of the interaction and analysed the molecular details of the binding of the 3-0-C12-HSL with LasR. A new interaction site of the 3-0-C12-HSL with LasR protein was found, which involves interaction with conservative residues from ligand binding domain (LBD), beta turns in the short linker region (SLR) and DNA binding domain (DBD). It will be referenced as the LBD-SLR-DBD bridge interaction or \""the bridge\"". We have also performed LasR monomer protein docking and found a new form of dimerization.\n\nConclusionsThis study may offer new insights for future experimental studies to detect the interaction of the autoinducer with \""the bridge\"" of LasR protein and a new interaction site for drug design.","Grabski, H.; Hunanyan, L.; Tiratsuyan, S.; Vardapetyan, H.",2017-09-08,Bioinformatics,10.1101/121681,3,Hovakim  Grabski,Russian-Armenian University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/121681v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/121681v3.full.pdf,cc_by,10.12688/f1000research.18435.1
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,16017,N-(3-Oxododecanoyl)-L-Homoserine Lactone Interactions In The Breast Tumor Microenvironment: Implications For Breast Cancer Viability And Proliferation In Vitro,"It is well documented that the tumor microenvironment profoundly impacts the etiology and progression of breast cancer, yet the contribution of the resident microbiome within breast tissue remains poorly understood. Tumor microenvironmental conditions, such as hypoxia and dense tumor stroma, predispose progressive phenotypes and therapy resistance, however the role of bacteria in this interplay remains uncharacterized. We hypothesized that the effect of individual bacterial secreted molecules on breast cancer viability and proliferation would be modulated by these tumor-relevant stressors differentially for cells at varying stages of progression. To test this, we incubated human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231, MCF-DCIS.com) and non-malignant breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) with N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (OdDHL), a quorum-sensing molecule from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that regulates bacterial stress responses. This molecule was selected because Pseudomonas was recently characterized as a significant fraction of the breast tissue microbiome and OdDHL is documented to impact mammalian cell viability. After OdDHL treatment, we demonstrated the greatest decrease in viability with the more malignant MDAMB-231 cells and an intermediate MCF-DCIS.com (ductal carcinoma in situ) response. The responses were also culture condition (i.e. microenvironment) dependent. These results contrast the MCF-10A response, which demonstrated no change in viability in any culture condition. We further determined that the observed trends in breast cancer viability were due to modulation of proliferation for both cell types, as well as the induction of necrosis for MDA-MB-231 cells in all conditions. Our results provide evidence that bacterial quorum-sensing molecules interact with the host tissue environment to modulate breast cancer viability and proliferation, and that the effect of OdDHL is dependent on both cell type as well as microenvironment. Understanding the interactions between bacterial signaling molecules and the host tissue environment will allow for future studies that determine the contribution of bacteria to the onset, progression, and therapy response of breast cancer.","Balhouse, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,17092,In Vivo Host-Pathogen Interaction As Revealed By Global Proteomic Profiling Of Zebrafish Larvae,"The outcome of a host-pathogen interaction is determined by the conditions of the host, the pathogen, and the environment. Although numerous proteomic studies of in vitro-grown microbial pathogens have been performed, in vivo proteomic approaches are still rare. In addition, increasing evidence supports that in vitro studies inadequately reflect in vivo conditions. Choosing the proper host is essential to detect the expression of proteins from the pathogen in vivo. Numerous studies have demonstrated the suitability of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model to in vivo studies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. In most zebrafish-pathogen studies, infection is achieved by microinjection of bacteria into the larvae. However, few reports using static immersion of bacterial pathogens have been published. In this study we infected 3 days post-fertilization (DPF) zebrafish larvae with P. aeruginosa PAO1 by immersion and injection and tracked the in vivo immune response by the zebrafish. Additionally, by using non-isotopic (Q-exactive) metaproteomics we simultaneously evaluated the proteomic response of the pathogen (P. aeruginosa PAO1) and the host (zebrafish). We found some zebrafish metabolic pathways, such as hypoxia response via HIF activation pathway, exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by static immersion. In contrast, we found that inflammation mediated by chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways was exclusively enriched in the larvae exposed by injection, while the integrin signaling pathway and angiogenesis were solely enriched in the larvae exposed by immersion. We also found important virulence factors from P. aeruginosa that were enriched only after exposure by injection, such as the Type-III secretion system and flagella-associated proteins. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa proteins involved in processes like biofilm formation, cellular responses to antibiotic and starvation were enriched exclusively after an exposure by immersion.\n\nWe demonstrated the suitability of zebrafish embryos as a model for in vivo host-pathogen based proteomic studies in P. aeruginosa. Our global proteomic profiling identifies novel molecular signatures that give systematic insight into zebrafish-Pseudomonas interaction.","Diaz-Pascual, F.; Ortiz-Severin, J.; Varas, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,17459,Influence Of Non-Metabolic Microbial Growth Promotors (AMP Activators) On The Sensitivity To Antimicrobials In The Actually Multiresistant Microbial Strains,"IntroductionThe control over multi-resistant nosocomial strains of microorganisms has been becoming increasingly urgent in recent years. We suggest a new paradigm that eliminates killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria. Excluding bacteria death supresses the selection of resistant strains of microorganisms. We have developed such non-metabolite growth promoters, which in very low doses stimulate the rapid growth of many bacteria strains. The mechanism of action of the enhancers is caused by the activation of the cAMP high doses accumulation process in the microbial cells. cAMP itself is a substrate for phosphorylation including DNA polymerases.\n\nMaterials and methodsThe susceptible culture collection resistance strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa MDR Kharkov IMI1, Acinetobacter baumanii MDR Kharkov-IMI1, and Clebsiella pneumonia MDR Kharkov-IMI1 were used. The following antimicrobial agents of known potency were evaluated: ciprofloxacin, polymyxin, amikacin. The same broth, but containing 0.001% enhancers (under patenting), has been used for further passaging for MDR strains. Characteristics of bacterial growth were determined in a medium compared at the control group - the broth without enhancers.\n\nResults and discussionEnhancers contribute to a significant increase in the antimicrobial sensitivity to polymyxin, ciprofloxacin and amikacin in multi-resistant strains of bacteria. Changes in the growth characteristics and antimicrobial sensitivity are observed only in the second passage that demonstrates the need for the further studies of the molecular mechanisms of the cAMP effect on the division and growth of microbial cells.","Martynov, A.; Osolodchenko, T.; Farber, B.; Farber, S.",2017-05-29,Microbiology,10.1101/143438,1,Artur  Martynov,Mechnikov Institute of Microbiology and Immunology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/143438v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/143438v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,17718,Novel Co-Culture Plate Enables Growth Dynamic-Based Assessment Of Contact-Independent Microbial Interactions,"Interactions between microbes are central to the dynamics of microbial communities. Understanding these interactions is essential for the characterization of communities, yet challenging to accomplish in practice. There are limited available tools for characterizing diffusion-mediated, contact-independent microbial interactions. A practical and widely implemented technique in such characterization involves the simultaneous co-culture of distinct bacterial species and subsequent analysis of relative abundance in the total population. However, distinguishing between species can be logistically challenging. In this paper, we present a low-cost, vertical membrane, co-culture plate to quantify contact-independent interactions between distinct bacterial populations in co-culture via real-time optical density measurements. These measurements can be used to facilitate the analysis of the interaction between microbes that are physically separated by a semipermeable membrane yet able to exchange diffusible molecules. We show that diffusion across the membrane occurs at a sufficient rate to enable effective interaction between physically separate cultures. Two bacterial species commonly found in the cystic fibrotic lung, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia, were co-cultured to demonstrate how this plate may be implemented to study microbial interactions. We have demonstrated that this novel co-culture device is able to reliably generate real-time measurements of optical density data that can be used to characterize interactions between microbial species.","Moutinho, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18304,An outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection linked to a Black Friday piercing event,"BackgroundOutbreaks linked to cosmetic piercing are rare, but can cause significant illness. We report the investigation and management of a point-source outbreak that occurred during a \""Black Friday\"" event in North West England.\n\nMethodsOutbreak investigation was led by Public Health England, and included active case finding among individuals pierced at a piercing premises between 25/11/2016 (\""Black Friday\"") and 7/12/2016. Detailed epidemiological, environmental (including inspection and sampling), and microbiological investigation was undertaken.\n\nResultsDuring the \""Black Friday\"" event (25/11/2016), 45 people were pierced (13 by a newly-appointed practitioner). Eleven cases were identified (7 microbiologically-confirmed, 2 probable, and 2 possible). All cases had clinical signs of infection around piercing sites, and five required surgical intervention, with varying degrees of post-operative disfigurement. All confirmed and probable cases had a \""scaffold piercing\"" placed with a guide bar by the newly-appointed practitioner. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indistinguishable at nine-locus variable-number tandem repeat loci, was isolated from four of the confirmed cases, and from pre- and post-flush samples from five separate water taps (three sinks) in the premises. Water samples taken after remedial plumbing work confirmed elimination of Pseudomonas contamination.\n\nConclusionsAlthough high levels of Pseudomonas water contamination and some poor infection control procedures were identified, infection appeared to require additional exposure to an inexperienced practitioner, and the more invasive scaffold piercing. A proactive collaborative approach between piercers and health and environmental officials is required to reduce outbreak risk, particularly when unusually large events are planned.","Macpherson, P.; Valentine, K.; Chadderton, V.; Dardamissis, E.; Doige, I.; Fox, A.; Ghebrehewet, S.; Hampton, T.; Mutton, K.; Sherratt, C.; Mccann, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18361,Bacteria defend against phages through type IV pilus glycosylation,"Bacterial surface structures such as type IV pili are common receptors for phage. Strains of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa express one of five different major type IV pilin alleles, two of which are glycosylated with either lipopolysaccharide O-antigen units or polymers of D-arabinofuranose. Here we show that both these post-translational modifications protect P. aeruginosa from a variety of pilus-specific phages. We identified a phage capable of infecting strains expressing both non-glycosylated and glycosylated pilins, and through construction of a chimeric phage, traced this ability to its unique tail proteins. Alteration of pilin sequence, or masking of binding sites by glycosylation, both block phage infection. The energy invested by prokaryotes in glycosylating thousands of pilin subunits is thus explained by the protection against phage predation provided by these common decorations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEPost-translational modification of bacterial and archaeal surface structures such as pili and flagella is widespread, but the function of these decorations is not clear. We propose that predation by bacteriophages that use these structures as receptors selects for strains that mask potential phage binding sites using glycosylation. Phages are of significant interest as alternative treatments for antibiotic-resistant pathogens, but the ways in which phage interact with host receptors are not well understood. We show that specific phage tail proteins allow for infection of strains with glycosylated pili, providing a foundation for the creation of designer phages that can circumvent first-line bacterial defenses.","Harvey, H.; Bondy-Denomy, J.; Marquis, H.; Sztanko, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18584,"Increased ParB level affects expression of stress response, adaptation and virulence operons and potentiates repression of promoters adjacent to the high affinity binding sites parS3 and parS4 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Similarly to its homologs in other bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa partitioning protein ParB facilitates segregation of newly replicated chromosomes. Lack of ParB is not lethal but results in increased frequency of anucleate cells production, longer division time, cell elongation, altered colony morphology and defective swarming and swimming motility. Unlike in other bacteria, inactivation of parB leads to major changes of the transcriptome, suggesting that, directly or indirectly, ParB plays a role in regulation of gene expression in this organism.\n\nParB overproduction affects growth rate, cell division and motility in a similar way as ParB deficiency. To identify primary ParB targets, here we analysed the impact of a slight increase in ParB level on P. aeruginosa transcriptome. ParB excess, which does not cause changes in growth rate and chromosome segregation, significantly alters the expression of 176 loci. Most notably, the mRNA level of genes adjacent to high affinity ParB binding sites parS1-4 close to oriC is reduced. Conversely, in cells lacking either parB or functional parS sequences the orfs adjacent to parS3 and parS4 are upregulated, indicating that direct ParB-parS3/parS4 interactions repress the transcription in this region. In addition, increased ParB level brings about repression or activation of numerous genes including several transcriptional regulators involved in SOS response, virulence and adaptation. Overall, our data support the role of partitioning protein ParB as a transcriptional regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Kawałek, A.; Głabski, K.; Bartosik, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18768,c-di-GMP-linked phenotypes are modulated by the interaction between a diguanylate cyclase and a polar hub protein,"c-di-GMP is a major player in the decision between biofilm and motile lifestyles. Several bacteria present a large number of c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins, thus a fine-tuning of this nucleotide levels may occur. It is hypothesized that some c-di-GMP metabolizing proteins would provide the global c-di-GMP levels inside the cell whereas others would maintain a localized pool, with the resulting c-di-GMP acting at the vicinity of its production. Although attractive, this hypothesis has yet to be proven in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that the diguanylate cyclase DgcP interacts with the cytosolic region of FimV, a peptidoglycan-binding protein involved in type IV pilus assembly. Moreover, DgcP is located at the cell poles in wild type cells, but scattered in the cytoplasm of cells lacking FimV. Overexpression of DgcP leads to the classical phenotypes of high c-di-GMP levels (increased biofilm and impaired motilities) in the wild-type strain, but not in a AfimV background. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that DgcP is regulated by FimV and may provide the local c-di-GMP pool that can be sensed by other proteins at the cell pole, bringing to light a specialized function for a specific diguanylate cyclase.","Nicastro, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,18817,Spatiotemporal relationships defining the adaptive gating of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS,"Adaptive desensitization and inactivation are common properties of most ion channels and receptors. The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance MscS, which serves as a low-threshold osmolyte release valve in most bacteria, is unusual because it slowly inactivates not from the open, but from the resting state under moderate tensions. The manifestation of this mechanism is the channels ability to discriminate the rate of tension application, i.e., to ignore slow tension ramps but fully respond to abruptly applied stimuli. In this work, we present a reconstruction of the landscape for tension-dependent MscS transitions based on patch current kinetics recorded under specially designed pressure protocols. The data are analyzed with a three-state continuous time Markov model of gating, where the tension-dependent transition rates are governed by Arrhenius-type relations. The analysis provides assignments to the intrinsic opening, closing, inactivation, and recovery rates as well as their tension dependencies. These parameters, which define the spatial (areal) distances between the energy wells and the positions of barriers, describe the tension-dependent distribution of the channel population between the three states and quantitatively predict the experimentally observed dynamic pulse and ramp responses. Our solution also provides an analytic expression for the area of the inactivated state in terms of two experimentally accessible parameters: the tension at which inactivation probability is maximized, {gamma}*, and the midpoint tension for activation, {gamma}0.5. The analysis initially performed on Escherichia coli MscS shows its applicability to the previously uncharacterized MscS homolog from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. MscS inactivation minimizes metabolic losses during osmotic permeability response and thus contributes to the environmental fitness of bacteria.","Cetiner, U.; Sukharev, S.",2017-06-23,Biophysics,10.1101/154435,1,Ugur  Cetiner,"University of Maryland, College Park",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/154435v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/154435v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1007/s00249-018-1303-5
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,19085,ADAGE signature analysis: differential expression analysis with data-defined gene sets,"BackgroundGene set enrichment analysis and overrepresentation analyses are commonly used methods to determine the biological processes affected by a differential expression experiment. This approach requires biologically relevant gene sets, which are currently curated manually, limiting their availability and accuracy in many organisms without extensively curated resources. New feature learning approaches can now be paired with existing data collections to directly extract functional gene sets from big data.\n\nResultsHere we introduce a method to identify perturbed processes. In contrast with methods that use curated gene sets, this approach uses signatures extracted from public expression data. We first extract expression signatures from public data using ADAGE, a neural network-based feature extraction approach. We next identify signatures that are differentially active under a given treatment. Our results demonstrate that these signatures represent biological processes that are perturbed by the experiment. Because these signatures are directly learned from data without supervision, they can identify uncurated or novel biological processes. We implemented ADAGE signature analysis for the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the convenience of different user groups, we implemented both an R package (ADAGEpath) and a web server (http://adage.greenelab.com) to run these analyses. Both are open-source to allow easy expansion to other organisms or signature generation methods. We applied ADAGE signature analysis to an example dataset in which wild-type and{Delta} anr mutant cells were grown as biofilms on the Cystic Fibrosis genotype bronchial epithelial cells. We mapped active signatures in the dataset to KEGG pathways and compared with pathways identified using GSEA. The two approaches generally return consistent results; however, ADAGE signature analysis also identified a signature that revealed the molecularly supported link between the MexT regulon and Anr.\n\nConclusionsWe designed ADAGE signature analysis to perform gene set analysis using data-defined functional gene signatures. This approach addresses an important gap for biologists studying non-traditional model organisms and those without extensive curated resources available. We built both an R package and web server to provide ADAGE signature analysis to the community.","Tan, J.; Huyck, M.; Hu, D.; Zelaya, R. A.; Hogan, D. A.; Greene, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,19680,The Acquisition of Resistance to Carbapenem and Macrolide-mediated Quorum Sensing Inhibition by Pseudomonas aeruginosa via a Novel Integrative and Conjugative Element ICETn43716385,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause persistant and life-threatening infections in immunocompromised patients. Carbapenems are the first-line agents to treat P. aeruginosa infections; therefore, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains has greatly challenged effective antibiotic therapy. In this study, we characterised the full-length genomes of two carbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates that produce the carbapebemase New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase-1 (NDM-1). We found that the blaNDM-1 gene is encoded by a novel intergrative and conjugative element (ICE) ICETn43716385, which also carries the macrolide resistance gene msr(E) and the florfenicol resistance gene floR. The msr(E) gene has rarely been described in P. aeruginosa genomes. To investigate the functional roles of msr(E) in P. aeruginosa, we exogeneously expressed this gene in P. aeruginosa laboratory strains and found that the acquisition of msr(E) could abolish the azithromycin-mediated quorum sensing inhibition in vitro and the anti-Pseudomonas effect of azithromycin in vivo. In addition, the expression of msr(E) almost completely restored the azithromycin-affected P. aeruginosa transcriptome, as shown by our RNA sequencing analysis. We present the first evidence of blaNDM-1 to be carried by intergrative and conjugative elements, and the first evidence of co-transfer of carbapenem resistance and the resistance to macrolide-mediated quorum sensing inhibition into P. aeruginosa genomes.\n\nImportanceCarbapenem resistant P. aeruginosa has recently been listed as the top three most dangerous superbugs by World Health Organisation. The transmission of blaNDM-1 gene into P. aeruginosa can cause extreme resistance to carbapenems and fourth generation cephalosporins, which greatly compromises the effectiveness of these antibiotics against Pseudomonas infections. However, the lack of complete genome sequence of NDM-1-producing P. aeruginosa has limited our understanding of the transmisibility of blaNDM-1 in this organism. Here we showed the co-transfer of blaNDM-1 and msr(E) into P. aeruginosa genome by a novel integrative and conjugative element (ICE). The acquisition of these two genes confers P. aeruginosa with resistance to carbapenem and macrolide-mediated quorum sensing inhibition, both of which are important treatment stretagies for P. aeruginosa infections. Our findings highlight the potential of ICEs in transmitting carbapenem resistance, and that the anti-virulence treatment of P. aeruginosa infections by macrolides can be challenged by horizontal gene transfer.","Ding, Y.; Teo, J.; Drautz-Moses, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,19860,The path to re-evolve cooperation is constrained in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"BackgroundA common form of cooperation in bacteria is based on the secretion of beneficial metabolites, shareable as public good among cells at the group level. Because cooperation can be exploited by \""cheat\"" mutants, which contribute less or nothing to the public good, there has been great interest in understanding the conditions required for cooperation to remain evolutionarily stable. In contrast, much less is known about whether cheats, once fixed in the population, are able to revert back to cooperation when conditions change. Here, we tackle this question by subjecting experimentally evolved cheats of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, partly deficient for the production of the iron-scavenging public good pyoverdine, to conditions previously shown to favor cooperation.\n\nResultsFollowing approximately 200 generations of experimental evolution, we screened 720 evolved clones for changes in their pyoverdine production levels. We found no evidence for the re-evolution of full cooperation, even in environments with increased spatial structure, and reduced costs of cooperation - two conditions that have previously been shown to maintain cooperation. In contrast, we observed selection for complete abolishment of pyoverdine production. The patterns of complete trait degradation were likely driven by \""cheating on cheats\"" in unstructured, iron-limited environments where pyoverdine is important for growth, and selection against a maladaptive trait in iron-rich environments where pyoverdine is superfluous.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that the path to re-evolve cooperation seems constrained. One reason might be that the number of mutational targets potentially leading to reversion is limited. Alternatively, it could be that the selective conditions required for revertants to spread from rare are much more stringent than those needed to maintain cooperation.","Granato, E.

This process is limited by hemocytes through phagocytosis. We have previously shown that the PA14 quorum-sensing regulator RhlR is required for these bacteria to elude the cellular immune response. RhlI synthesizes the auto-inducer signal that activates RhlR. Here, we compare the null mutant phenotypes of rhlR and rhlI in a variety of infection assays in Drosophila and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Surprisingly, in Drosophila, unlike{Delta} rhlR mutants,{Delta} rhlI mutants are only modestly attenuated for virulence and are poorly phagocytosed and opsonized in a Thioester-containing Protein4-dependent manner. Likewise, {Delta}rhlI but not {Delta}rhlR mutants colonize the digestive tract of C. elegans and kill it as efficiently as wild-type PA14. Thus, RhlR has an RhlI-independent function in eluding detection or counter-acting the action of the immune system. In contrast to the intestinal infection model, Tep4 mutant flies are more resistant to PA14 in a septic injury model, which also depends on rhlR. Thus, the Tep4 putative opsonin can either be protective or detrimental to host defense depending on the infection route.","Haller, S.; Franchet, A.; Hakkim, A.; Chen, J.; Drenkard, E.; Yu, S.; Schirmeier, S.; Li, Z.; Ausubel, F.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,20170,"Pseudopaline, a staphylopine-like metallophore involved in zinc and nickel uptake in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Metal uptake is vital for all living organisms. In metal scarce conditions, a common bacterial strategy consists in the biosynthesis of metallophores, their export in the extracellular medium and the recovery of a metal-metallophore complex through dedicated membrane transporters. Staphylopine is a recently described metallophore distantly related to plant nicotianamine that contributes to the broad-spectrum metal uptake capabilities of Staphylococcus aureus. Here, we characterize a four genes operon (PA4837-PA4834) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in the biosynthesis and trafficking of a staphylopine-like metallophore named pseudopaline. Pseudopaline differs from staphylopine with regard to the stereochemistry of its histidine moiety associated to an alpha ketoglutarate moiety instead of pyruvate. In vivo, the pseudopaline operon is regulated by zinc through the Zur repressor. The metal-uptake property of the pseudopaline system appears different from that of staphylopine with a predominant effect on nickel uptake, and on zinc uptake in metal scarce conditions mimicking a chelating environment, thus reconciling the regulation of the cnt operon by zinc with its function as a zinc importer under metal scarce conditions.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYZinc is an essential micronutrients for bacteria, particularly important at the host-pathogen interface where the host tends to sequester metals in a so called nutritional immunity framework, and the pathogenic bacterium increases its metal uptake efforts in order to keep up with its metal requirements. Here we reveal a novel metallophore, named pseudopaline, which is synthesized and exported by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and serves for the uptake of nickel in metal poor media, and for the uptake of zinc in metal scarce conditions that mimic the chelating environment that presumably prevails within a host.","Lhospice, S.; Gomez, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,20907,An orphan cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase subunit supports Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm growth and virulence,"Hypoxia is a common challenge faced by bacteria during associations with hosts due in part to the formation of densely packed communities (biofilms). cbb3-type cytochrome c oxidases, which catalyze the terminal step in respiration and have a high affinity for oxygen, have been linked to bacterial pathogenesis. The pseudomonads are unusual in that they often contain multiple full and partial (i.e., \""orphan\"") operons for cbb3-type oxidases and oxidase subunits. Here, we describe a unique role for the orphan catalytic subunit CcoN4 in colony biofilm development and respiration in the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa PA14. We also show that CcoN4 contributes to the reduction of phenazines, antibiotics that support redox balancing for cells in biofilms, and to virulence in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of infection. These results highlight the relevance of the colony biofilm model to pathogenicity and underscore the potential of cbb3-type oxidases as therapeutic targets.","Jo, J.; Cortez, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,22244,Synergy of Quorum Quenching Enzyme and Quorum Sensing Inhibitor in Inhibiting P. aeruginosa Quorum Sensing,"The threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria has called for alternative antimicrobial strategies that would mitigate the increase of classical resistance mechanism. Many bacteria employ quorum sensing (QS) to govern the production of virulence genes and formation of drug-resistance biofilms. Blocking QS mechanisms have proven to be a functional alternative to conventional antibiotic control of infections. The concepts of quorum sensing inhibitors (QSI) and quorum quenching enzymes (QQ) have been investigated separately. In this study however, we simulated the synergistic effect of QQ and QSI in blocking bacterial QS. This effect was validated by experiments using AiiA and G1 as QQ and QSI respectively on Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR/I and RhlR/I QS circuits. The combination of a QQ and a QSI almost completely blocked the P. aeruginosa QS las and rhl system. Our findings provided a potential application strategy for bacterial QS disruption.","Fong, J.; Zhang, C.; Yang, R.; Boo, Z. Z.; Tan, S. K.; Nielsen, T.

Studies have shown BrlR plays an important role in high level drug tolerance of P. aeruginosa in biofilm. Its drug tolerance ability can be enhanced by 3',5'-cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP). Here, we show the apo structure of BrlR and the direct binding between GyrI-like domain of BrlR and P. aeruginosa toxin pyocyanin. Furthermore, pyocyanin can enhance the binding between BrlR and DNA in vitro.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,23286,Pharmacodynamic Considerations of Collateral Sensitivity in Design of Antibiotic Treatment Regimen,"Antibiotics have greatly reduced the morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases. Although antibiotic resistance is not a new problem, its breadth now constitutes a significant threat to human health. One strategy to help combat resistance is to find novel ways to use existing drugs, even those that display high rates of resistance. For the pathogens Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pairs of antibiotics have been identified for which evolution of resistance to drug A increases sensitivity to drug B and vice versa. These research groups have proposed cycling such pairs to treat infections, similar treatment strategies are being investigated for various cancer forms as well.\n\nWhile an exciting treatment prospect, no cycling experiments have yet been performed with consideration of pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). To test the plausibility of this scheme and search for ways to optimize it, we create a mathematical model with explicit PK-PD considerations. We study several possible treatment protocols using pairs of such antibiotics, and investigate the speed of ascent of multiply resistant mutants. Our analyses show that for low concentrations of antibiotics, treatment failure will always occur due to the rapid ascent and fixation of resistant mutants. However, at moderate to high concentrations of some types of bacteriostatic antibiotics with multiday cycling, resistance is prevented from developing and treatment succeeds. This calls for guarded optimism of such treatment protocols whose development can be directed by these types of models.","Udekwu, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,23360,Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV minor pilins and PilY1 regulate virulence by modulating FimS-AlgR activity,"Type IV pili are expressed by a wide range of prokaryotes, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 is proposed to be a mechanosensory component that - in conjunction with minor pilins - triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the minor pilin operon and other members of the AlgR regulon. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for the increased expression from the minor pilin operon promoter upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via point mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants were dependent on FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR and reduced expression of acute-phase virulence factors. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors - such as alginate - that are characteristic of such infections.\n\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa causes dangerous infections, including chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. It uses many strategies to infect its hosts, including deployment of grappling hook-like fibres called type IV pili. Among the components involved in assembly and function of the pilus are five proteins called minor pilins that - along with a larger protein called PilY1 - may help the pilus attach to surfaces. In a roundworm infection model, loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins delayed killing, while loss of other pilus proteins did not. We traced this effect to increased activation of the FimS-AlgR regulatory system that inhibits expression of virulence factors used to initiate infections, while positively regulating chronic infection traits such as alginate production, a phenotype called mucoidy. A disruption in the appropriate timing of FimS-AlgR-dependent virulence factor expression when select minor pilins or PilY1 are missing may explain why those pilus-deficient mutants have reduced virulence compared with others whose products are not under FimS-AlgR control. Increased FimS-AlgR activity upon loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of the non-piliated and mucoid phenotypes that are hallmarks of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections.","Marko, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,23590,"Isolation of phosphate solubilizing Pseudomonas strains from apple rhizosphere in the Trans Himalayan region of Himachal Pradesh, India","Total fifteen phosphate solubilizing bacteria were isolated from rhizosphere soil of apple tree on Kings B medium belonging to genus Pseudomonas spp. They were characterized on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics. Preliminary selection as phosphate solubilizing bacteria were done on the basis of formation of transparent zone around the colony on Pikovskayas agar medium containing 0.5% triclcium phosphate (TCP). Maximum in vitro phosphate solubilization on Pikovskayas agar plates after 72h incubation at 28{degrees}C was shown by An-15-Mg (46 mm), whereas in case of broth, again this strain showed maximum tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilization (76 g/ml). The pH of each inoculated broth was recorded daily and dropped significantly (pH 7.0-3.99). All the Pseudomonas isolates were further evaluated for overall plant growth promoting traits. Greatest siderophore activity was exhibited by An-14-Mg (71.23 %SU) followed by An-15-Mg (70.12 %SU) which were statiscally at par with each other. Whereas, maximum IAA production was observed again in An-15-Mg (95 g/ml). This isolate also showed the maximum production of HCN and ammonia. 16S rDNA and phylogenetic analysis showed that strain An-15-Mg exhibits 99% level of similarity with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it was designated as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain An-15-Mg. HPLC analysis showed that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain An-15-Mg produced maximum concentration of succinic acid, malonic, citric and malic acid with small amounts of schimic, quinic, tartaric, fumaric and lactic acids. The strain An-15-Mg possessed phosphate solubilization as major PGP trait along with different PGP traits. The potential phosphate solubilizing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported first time as PGPR which lives in close association with apple tree without harming the plant, therefore could be used as a promising phosphate solubilizer and biofertilizer in apple crop grown in high hills of Himachal Pradesh.\n\nAuthors contributionAll authors made significant efforts towards the completion of this research work and preparation of manuscript timely.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,24031,Probing the evolutionary robustness of two repurposed drugs targeting iron uptake in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Background and objectivesTreatments that inhibit the expression or functioning of bacterial virulence factors hold great promise to be both effective and exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, the evolutionary robustness argument, based on the idea that anti-virulence treatments disarm rather than kill pathogens, is controversial. Here we probe the evolutionary robustness of two repurposed drugs, gallium and flucytosine, targeting the iron-scavenging pyoverdine of the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nMethodologyWe subjected replicated cultures of bacteria to two concentrations of each drug for 20 consecutive days in human serum as an ex-vivo infection model. We screened evolved populations and clones for resistance phenotypes, including the restoration of growth and pyoverdine production, and the evolution of iron uptake by-passing mechanisms. We whole-genome sequenced evolved clones to identify the genetic basis of resistance.\n\nResultsWe found that mutants resistant against anti-virulence treatments readily arose, but their selective spreading varied between treatments. Flucytosine resistance quickly spread in all populations due to disruptive mutations in upp, a gene encoding an enzyme required for flucytosine activation. Conversely, resistance against gallium arose only sporadically, and was based on mutations in transcriptional regulators, upregulating pyocyanin production, a redox-active molecule promoting siderophore-independent iron acquisition. The spread of gallium resistance could be hampered because pyocyanin-mediated iron delivery benefits resistant and susceptible cells alike.\n\nConclusions and implicationsOur work highlights that anti-virulence treatments are not evolutionarily robust per se. Instead, evolutionary robustness is a relative measure, with specific treatments occupying different positions on a continuous scale.","Rezzoagli, C.; Wilson, D.; Weigert, M.; Wyder, S.; Kuemmerli, R.",2018-08-31,Microbiology,10.1101/195974,3,Chiara  Rezzoagli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/195974v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/195974v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/emph/eoy026
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,24224,Auranofin inhibits virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is widely attributed as the leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. Due to intrinsic antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the ability to form biofilms, P. aeruginosa infections are challenging to treat. P. aeruginosa employs multiple virulence mechanisms to establish infections, many of which are controlled by the global virulence regulator Vfr. An attractive strategy to combat P. aeruginosa infections is thus the use of anti-virulence compounds. Here, we report the discovery that FDA-approved drug auranofin attenuates virulence in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that auranofin acts by targeting Vfr, which in turn leads to inhibition of quorum sensing (QS) and Type IV pili (TFP). Consistent with inhibition of QS and TFP expression, we show that auranofin attenuates biofilm maturation, and when used in combination with colistin, displays strong synergy in eradicating P. aeruginosa biofilms. Auranofin may have immediate applications as an anti-virulence drug against P. aeruginosa infections.","Tan, L. Z. W.; Yam, J. K. H.; Hong, Z.; Salido, M. M. S.; Woo, B. Y.; Li, S. F.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,98939,Extracellular DNA promotes efficient extracellular electron transfer by pyocyanin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms,"Extracellular electron transfer (EET), the process whereby cells access electron acceptors or donors that reside many cell lengths away, enables metabolic activity by microorganisms, particularly under oxidant-limited conditions that occur in multicellular bacterial biofilms. Although different mechanisms underpin this process in select organisms, a widespread strategy involves extracellular electron shuttles, redox-active metabolites that are secreted and recycled by diverse bacteria. How these shuttles catalyze electron transfer within biofilms without being lost to the environment has been a long-standing question. Here, we show that phenazine electron shuttles mediate efficient EET through interactions with extracellular DNA (eDNA) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms, which are important in nature and disease. Retention of pyocyanin (PYO) and phenazine carboxamide in the biofilm matrix is facilitated by binding to eDNA. In vitro, different phenazines can exchange electrons in the presence or absence of DNA and phenazines can participate directly in redox reactions through DNA; the biofilm eDNA can also support rapid electron transfer between redox active intercalators. Electrochemical measurements of biofilms indicate that retained PYO supports an efficient redox cycle with rapid EET and slow loss from the biofilm. Together, these results establish that eDNA facilitates phenazine metabolic processes in P. aeruginosa biofilms, suggesting a model for how extracellular electron shuttles achieve retention and efficient EET in biofilms.","Saunders, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,98914,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa lectin LecB causes integrin internalization to facilitate crawling of bacteria underneath host cells,"The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces the fucose-specific lectin LecB, which has been identified as virulence factor. LecB has a tetrameric structure with four opposing binding sites and has been shown to act as crosslinker. Here, we demonstrate that LecB strongly binds to the glycosylated moieties of {beta}1-integrins on the basolateral plasma membrane of epithelial cells and caused rapid integrin endocytosis. Whereas internalized integrins were degraded via a lysosomal pathway, washout of LecB restored integrin cell surface localization, thus indicating a specific and direct action of LecB on integrins to bring about their endocytosis. Interestingly, LecB was able to trigger uptake of active and inactive {beta}1-integrins and also of complete 3{beta}1-integrin - laminin complexes. We provide a mechanistic explanation for this unique endocytic process by showing that LecB has the additional ability to recognize fucose-bearing glycosphingolipids and caused the formation of membrane invaginations on giant unilamellar vesicles. In cells, LecB recruited integrins to these invaginations by crosslinking integrins and glycosphingolipids. In epithelial wound healing assays, LecB specifically cleared integrins from the surface of cells located at the wound edge and blocked cell migration and wound healing in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the wild type P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 was able to loosen cell-substrate adhesion in order to crawl underneath exposed cells, whereas knockout of LecB significantly reduced crawling events. Based on these results we suggest that LecB has a role in disseminating bacteria along the cell - basement membrane interface.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium that is one of the leading causes for nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa is able to switch between planktonic, intracellular, and biofilm-based lifestyles, which allows it to evade the immune system as well as antibiotic treatment. Hence, alternatives to antibiotic treatment are urgently required to combat P. aeruginosa infections. Lectins, like the fucose-specific LecB, are promising targets, because removal of LecB resulted in decreased virulence in mouse models. Currently, several research groups are developing LecB inhibitors. However, the role of LecB in host-pathogen interaction is not well understood. The significance of our research is in identifying cellular mechanisms how LecB facilitates P. aeruginosa infection: We introduce LecB as new member to the list of bacterial molecules that bind integrins and show that P. aeruginosa can efficiently move forward underneath attached epithelial cells by loosening cell - basement membrane attachment in a LecB-dependent manner.","Thuenauer, R.; Landi, A.; Trefzer, A.; Altmann, S.; Wehrum, S.; Eierhoff, T.; Diedrich, B.; Dengjel, J.; Nystroem, A.; Imberty, A.; Roemer, W.",2019-12-12,Microbiology,10.1101/2019.12.12.872739,1,Winfried  Roemer,University of Freiburg,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.872739v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.872739v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,99748,Transient CRISPR immunity leads to coexistence with phages,"Phages play a major role in shaping the composition, evolution and function of bacterial communities. While bacteria and phages coexist in many natural environments, their coexistence is often short-lived in the lab due to the evolution of phage resistance. However, fitness costs associated with resistance and mutational loss of resistance alleles may limit the durability of acquired resistances, potentially allowing phages to re-invade the population. Here, we explore this idea in the context of bacteria that evolve CRISPR-based immunity against their phages. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 evolved high levels of CRISPR-based immunity and low levels of surface-based resistance following infection with phage DMS3vir, which led to rapid phage extinction. However, when these pre-immunized bacterial populations were subsequently challenged with the same phage, they failed to clear the infection and instead stably coexisted with the phage. Analysis of bacterial genotypes and phenotypes over time explained why CRISPR-Cas immunity provides only a transient advantage: in the absence of phage (i.e. following the initial phage extinction) formerly CRISPR-immune bacteria regain sensitivity due to evolutionary loss of spacers, whereas in the presence of phage (i.e. upon reinfection) selection favours surface-based resistance over CRISPR immunity. The latter results from an infection-induced fitness cost of CRISPR-immunity that is due to phage gene expression prior to target DNA cleavage by the immune system. Together, these results show that CRISPR-Cas immune systems provide only a transient benefit to bacteria upon phage infection and help to explain why bacteria and phages can coexist in natural environments even when bacteria carry CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems that allow for rapid acquisition of immunity against phages.","Meaden, S.; Capria, L.; Alseth, E.; Biswas, A.; Lenzi, L.; Buckling, A.; Van Houte, S.; Westra, E.",2019-12-19,Microbiology,10.1101/2019.12.19.882027,1,Sean  Meaden,University of Exeter,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.882027v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.882027v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Sputum-microbiota contributed more than the gut in the mixed models; in addition, sputum-only models performed similarly to the mixed models in most cases. Several microbial-biomarkers were shared by both microbiota, indicating their similar roles at distinct body sites. Microbial-biomarkers of distinct disease stages were mostly shared, suggesting biomarkers for distant metastasis could be acquired early. Furthermore, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species previously associated with wound infections, was significantly more abundant in brain metastasis, indicating distinct types of DMs could have different microbial-biomarkers.

ConclusionOur results indicate that alterations of sputum-microbiota have stronger relationships with NSCLC and distant metastasis than the gut, and strongly support the feasibility of metagenome-based non-invasive disease diagnosis and risk evaluation.","Chen, W.-H.; Lu, H.; Gao, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,101544,The formation of microbial exoskeletons is driven by a controlled calcium-concentrating subcellular niche,"In nature, bacteria reside in biofilms - multicellular differentiated communities held together by extracellular matrix. In this work, we identified a novel subpopulation essential for biofilm formation - mineral-forming cells. This subpopulation contains an intracellular calcium-accumulating niche, in which the formation of a calcium carbonate mineral is initiated. As the biofilm colony develops, this mineral grows in a controlled manner, forming a functional macrostructure that serves the entire community.

The molecular mechanisms promoting calcite scaffold formation were conserved between three distant phyla - the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the actinobacterium Mycobacterium abscessus. Biofilm development of all three species was similarly impaired by inhibition of calcium uptake and carbonate accumulation. Moreover, chemical inhibition and mutations targeting mineralization both significantly reduced the attachment of P. aeruginosa to the lung, as well as the subsequent damage inflicted by biofilms to lung tissues, and restored their sensitivity to antibiotics.

The evolutionary conserved cellular pathway controlling the fundamental feature of biofilm development uncovered in this work offers novel druggable targets for antibiotics to combat otherwise untreatable biofilm infections.","Keren-Paz, A.; Cohen-Cymberknoh, M.; Kolodkin-Gal, D.; Peretz, S.; Karunker, I.; Wolf, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,101668,Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to the innate immune system-derived oxidants hypochlorous acid and hypothiocyanous acid,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant nosocomial pathogen and associated with lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). Once established, P. aeruginosa infections persist and are rarely eradicated despite the host immune cells producing antimicrobial oxidants, including hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN). There is limited knowledge as to how P. aeruginosa senses, responds to, and survives attack from HOCl and HOSCN, and the contribution of such responses to its success as a CF pathogen. We investigated the P. aeruginosa response to these oxidants by screening 707 transposon mutants, with mutations in regulatory genes, for altered growth following HOCl exposure. We identified regulators involved in antibiotic resistance, methionine biosynthesis and catabolite repression, and PA14_07340, the homologue of the Escherichia coli HOCl-sensor RclR (30% identical), that were required for HOCl survival. We have shown that RclR (PA14_07340) protects specifically against HOCl and HOSCN stress, and responds to both oxidants by upregulating expression of a putative peroxiredoxin, rclX (PA14_07355). While there was specificity in the transcriptional response to HOCl (231 genes upregulated) and HOSCN (105 genes upregulated) there was considerable overlap, with 74 genes upregulated by both oxidants. These included genes encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS), sulphur and taurine transport, and the MexEF-OprN efflux pump. RclR coordinated the transcriptional response to HOCl and HOSCN, including upregulation of pyocyanin biosynthesis genes, and in response to HOSCN alone RclR downregulated chaperone genes. These data indicate that the P. aeruginosa response to HOCl and HOSCN is multifaceted, with RclR playing an essential role.","Farrant, K. V.; Spiga, L.; Davies, J. C.; Williams, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,101926,Visible Light Plasmon Excitation of Silver Nanoparticles Against Antibiotic-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The interaction of metallic nanoparticles with light excites a local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). This phenomenon enables the transfer of hot electrons to substrates that release Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). In this context, the present study was aimed at enhancing the antibacterial effect of citrate-covered silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), which already possess excellent antimicrobial properties, via LSPR excitation with visible LED against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the most refractory organisms to antibiotic treatment. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of AgNPs was 10 g/ml under dark conditions and 5 g/ml under light conditions. The combination of light and AgNPs led to 100% cell death after 60 minutes. Quantification of ROS via flow cytometry showed that LSPR stimulated AgNPs increased intracellular ROS concentration by 4.8-fold, suggesting that light-exposed AgNPs caused cell death via ROS production. Light exposition caused a small release of silver ions (0.4%) reaching a maximum after 6 hours. This indicates that silver ions play at most a secondary role in P. aeruginosa death. Overall, the results presented here show that LSPR generation from AgNPs by visible light enhances the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles and can be an alternative for the treatment of topic infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa.","Trivella, R.; Petri, M.; Valencia, E.-Y.; Camargo, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,102139,Crystal structure of NirF: Insights into its role in heme d1 biosynthesis,"Certain facultative anaerobes such as the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can respire on nitrate, a process generally known as denitrification. This enables denitrifying bacteria to survive in anoxic environments and contributes e.g. to the formation of biofilm, hence increasing difficulties in eradicating P. aeruginosa infections. A central step in denitrification is the reduction of nitrite to nitrous oxide by nitrite reductase NirS, an enzyme that requires the unique cofactor heme d1. While heme d1 biosynthesis is mostly understood, the role of the essential periplasmatic protein NirF in this pathway remains unclear. Here, we have determined crystal structures of NirF and its complex with dihydroheme d1, the last intermediate of heme d1 biosynthesis. We found that NirF forms a bottom-to-bottom {beta}-propeller homodimer and confirmed this by multi-angle light and small-angle X-ray scattering. The N-termini are immediately neighbored and project away from the core structure, which hints at simultaneous membrane anchoring via both N-termini. Further, the complex with dihydroheme d1 allowed us to probe the importance of specific residues in the vicinity of the ligand binding site, revealing residues not required for binding or stability of NirF but essential for denitrification in experiments with complemented mutants of a {Delta}nirF strain of P. aeruginosa. Together, these data implicate that NirF possesses a yet unknown enzymatic activity and is not simply a binding protein of heme d1 derivatives.","Kluenemann, T.; Nimtz, M.; Jaensch, L.; Layer, G.; Blankenfeldt, W.",2020-01-14,Biochemistry,10.1101/2020.01.13.904656,1,Wulf  Blankenfeldt,Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.904656v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.13.904656v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1111/febs.15323
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,102469,Improved bacterial recombineering by parallelized protein discovery,"Exploiting bacteriophage-derived homologous recombination processes has enabled precise, multiplex editing of microbial genomes and the construction of billions of customized genetic variants in a single day. The techniques that enable this, Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) and directed evolution with random genomic mutations (DIvERGE), are however currently limited to a handful of microorganisms for which single-stranded DNA-annealing proteins (SSAPs) that promote efficient recombineering have been identified. Thus, to enable genome-scale engineering in new hosts, highly efficient SSAPs must first be found. Here we introduce a high-throughput method for SSAP discovery that we call Serial Enrichment for Efficient Recombineering (SEER). By performing SEER in E. coli to screen hundreds of putative SSAPs, we identify highly active variants PapRecT and CspRecT. CspRecT increases the efficiency of single-locus editing to as high as 50% and improves multiplex editing by 5 to 10-fold in E. coli, while PapRecT enables efficient recombineering in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a concerning human pathogen. CspRecT and PapRecT are also active in other, clinically and biotechnologically relevant enterobacteria. We envision that the deployment of SEER in new species will pave the way toward pooled interrogation of genotype-to-phenotype relationships in previously intractable bacteria.","Wannier, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,103453,Spatial-temporal dynamics of a microbial cooperative behavior robust to cheating,"Individuals living in dense populations control their behaviors by sensing, integrating and responding to many cues. How can these processes enable the evolution and stability of cooperative behaviors that could easily be exploited by cheaters? Here we shed light on how bacteria regulate cooperation by studying swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a behavior requiring cooperative secretions of rhamnolipid surfactants to facilitate collective movement over surfaces. By combining fluorescent imaging and computational analyses we show, counterintuitively, that rhamnolipid expression peaks at swarming edges. We then show that the integration of competing diffusive cues--quorum sensing signals and growth-limiting nutrients--enables P. aeruginosa to communicate across centimeters and adopt expression patterns unseen in well-mixed liquid culture. Integration of multiple cues enables robustness against cheating even when we experimentally perturb the quorum sensing system. Taken together, these results illuminate how the integration of cues in spatially structured communities can stabilize cooperation.","Monaco, H.; Sereno, T.; Liu, K.; Reagor, C.; Deforet, M.; Xavier, J.",2020-02-03,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2020.01.23.914481,2,Joao  Xavier,"Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.914481v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.914481v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,103705,Computationally-guided technology platform for on-demand production of diversified therapeutic phage cocktails,"New therapies are necessary to combat increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We have developed a technology platform of computational, molecular biology, and microbiology tools which together enable on-demand production of phages that target virtually any given bacterial isolate. Two complementary computational tools that identify and precisely map prophages and other integrative genetic elements (IGEs) in bacterial genomes are used to identify prophage-laden bacteria that are close relatives of the target strain. Phage genomes are engineered to disable lysogeny, through use of long amplicon PCR and Gibson assembly. Finally, the engineered phage genomes are introduced into host bacteria for phage production. As an initial demonstration, we used this approach to produce a phage cocktail against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Two prophage-laden P. aeruginosa strains closely related to PAO1 were identified, ATCC 39324 and ATCC 27853. Deep sequencing revealed that mitomycin C treatment of these strains induced seven phages that grow on P. aeruginosa PAO1. The most diverse five of these were engineered for non-lysogeny by deleting the integrase gene (int), which is readily identifiable and typically conveniently located at one end of the prophage. The {Delta}int phages, individually and in cocktails, showed killing of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in vitro as well as in a waxworm (Galleria mellonella) model of infection.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe antibiotic-resistance crisis in medicine and agriculture has led to renewed interest in phage therapy as an alternative means of treating infection. However, conventional methods for isolating pathogen-specific phage are slow, labor-intensive, and frequently unsuccessful. We have demonstrated that prophages carried by near-neighbor bacteria can serve as starting material for production of engineered phages that kill the target pathogen. Our approach and technology platform offer new opportunity for rapid development of phage therapies against most, if not all, bacterial pathogens, a foundational advance for use of phage in treating infectious disease.","Mageeney, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,103703,C. elegans reads bacterial non-coding RNAs to learn pathogenic avoidance,"C. elegans is exposed to many different bacteria in its environment, and must distinguish pathogenic from nutritious bacterial food sources. Here, we show that a single exposure to purified small RNAs isolated from pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) is sufficient to induce pathogen avoidance, both in the treated animals and in four subsequent generations of progeny. The RNA interference and piRNA pathways, the germline, and the ASI neuron are required for bacterial small RNA-induced avoidance behavior and transgenerational inheritance. A single non-coding RNA, P11, is both necessary and sufficient to convey learned avoidance of PA14, and its C. elegans target, maco-1, is required for avoidance. A natural microbiome Pseudomonas isolate, GRb0427, can induce avoidance via its small RNAs, and the wild C. elegans strain JU1580 responds similarly to bacterial sRNA. Our results suggest that this ncRNA-dependent mechanism evolved to survey the worms microbial environment, use this information to make appropriate behavioral decisions, and pass this information on to its progeny.","Kaletsky, R.; Moore, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,104255,Biofilms deform soft surfaces and disrupt epithelia.,"During chronic infections and in microbiota, bacteria predominantly colonize their hosts as multicellular structures called biofilms. Despite their ubiquity in vivo, we still lack a basic understanding of how they interact with biological tissues, and ultimately how they influence host physiology. A common assumption is that biofilms interact with their hosts biochemically. However, the contributions of mechanics, while being central to the process of biofilm formation, have been vastly overlooked as a factor influencing host physiology. Specifically, how biofilms form on soft, tissue-like materials remains unknown. Here we show that biofilms can deform soft substrates by transmission of internally-generated mechanical stresses. We found that biofilms from both Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can induce large deformations of soft synthetic hydrogels. Using a combination of mechanical measurements and mutants in matrix components, we found that biofilms deform their substrates by simultaneous buckling and adhesion. Specifically, mechanical constraints opposing growth causes biofilm buckling, while matrix components maintaining surface adhesion transmit buckling forces to the substrate. Finally, we demonstrate that biofilms can generate sufficient mechanical stress to deform and disrupt soft epithelial cell monolayers, suggesting that these forces can damage a host independently of typical virulence factors. Altogether, our results illustrate that forces generated by bacterial communities play an important role not only in biofilm morphogenesis but also in host physiology, suggesting a mechanical mode of infection.","Cont, A.; Rossy, T.; Al-Mayyah, Z.; Persat, A.",2020-02-27,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.01.29.923060,2,Alexandre  Persat,Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.923060v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.29.923060v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.7554/eLife.56533
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,104615,The ECF sigma factor PvdS regulates the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"During infection, successful colonization of bacteria requires a fine-tuned supply of iron acquired via iron transport systems. However, the transport systems serve as phage attachment sites and entry portals for foreign nucleic acid. Most bacteria possess the CRISPR-Cas system, which targets and destroys foreign nucleic acids and prevents deleterious effects of horizontal gene transfer. To understand the regulation of the CRISPR-Cas system, we performed genome-wide random transposon mutagenesis which led to the identification of the Extracytoplasmic Function (ECF) Sigma factor, PvdS as a regulator of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in P. aeruginosa. We show that under iron-depleted conditions PvdS induces the expression of the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. This regulatory mechanism involves direct interaction of PvdS with specific binding sites in the promoter region of cas1. Furthermore, activation of the CRISPR-Cas system under iron-depleted conditions increases horizontal gene transfer (HGT) interference and adaptation. The PvdS activation of the CRISPR-Cas system under iron limitation highlights the versatility of the P. aeruginosa in multitasking its regulatory machinery to integrate multiple stress factors.

ImportanceP. aeruginosa infects a wide range of host organisms and adapts to various environmental stress factors such as iron limitation due to its elaborate regulatory system. P aeruginosa possesses the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system as a defense mechanism against phages infection and HGT. This work highlights the ability of P. aeruginosa to multitask its iron regulatory system to control the CRISPR-Cas system under a physiologically relevant stress factor such as iron limitation where the bacteria are vulnerable to phage infection. It also adds to the knowledge of the regulation of the CRISPR-Cas system in bacteria and presents a possible target that could prevent the emergence of phage resistance via the CRISPR-Cas system during the development of phage therapy.","Ahator, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,104614,Generation of Xylose-inducible promoter tools for Pseudomonas species and their use in implicating a role for the Type II secretion system protein XcpQ in inhibition of corneal epithelial wound closure,"Tunable control of gene expression is an invaluable tool for biological experiments. In this study, we describe a new xylose-inducible promoter system and evaluate it in both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. fluorescens. The Pxut promoter derived from the P. flurorescens xut operon was incorporated into a broad host-range pBBR1-based plasmid and compared to the Escherichia coli-derived PBAD promoter using gfp as a reporter. GFP-fluorescence from the Pxut promoter was inducible in both Pseudomonas species, but not in E. coli, which may facilitate cloning of toxic genes using E. coli to generate plasmids. The Pxut promoter was expressed at a lower inducer concentration than PBAD in P. fluorescens and higher gfp levels were achieved using Pxut. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that Pxut was more leaky than PBAD in the tested Pseudomonas species, but was expressed in a higher proportion of cells when induced. D-xylose did not support growth of P. aeruginosa or P. fluorescens as a sole carbon source and is less expensive than many other commonly used inducers which could facilitate large scale applications. The efficacy of this system aided in demonstrating a role for the P. aeruginosa type II secretion system gene from xcpQ in bacterial inhibition of corneal epithelial cell wound closure. This study introduces a new inducible promoter system for gene expression for use in Pseudomonas species.

ImportancePseudomonas species are enormously important in human infections, biotechnology, and as a model system for interrogating basic science questions. In this study we have developed a xylose-inducible promoter system and evaluated it in P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens and found it to be suitable for the strong induction of gene expression. Furthermore, we have demonstrated its efficacy in controlled gene expression to show that a type 2 secretion system protein from P. aeruginosa, XcpQ, is important for host-pathogen interactions in a corneal wound closure model.","Callaghan, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,104781,Gene loss and acquisition in lineages of bacteria evolving in a human host environment,"While genome analyses have documented that there are differences in the gene repertoire between evolutionary distant lineages of the same bacterial species, less is known about micro-evolutionary dynamics of gene loss and acquisition within lineages of bacteria as they evolve over the timescale of years. This knowledge is valuable to understand both the basic mutational steps that on long timescales lead to evolutionary distant bacterial lineages, and the evolution of the individual lineages themselves. In the case that lineages evolve in a human host environment, gene loss and acquisition may furthermore have implication for disease.

We analyzed the genomes of 45 Pseudomonas aeruginosa lineages evolving in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients to identify genes that are lost or acquired during the first years of infection in each of the different lineages. On average, the lineage genome content changed with 88 genes (range 0-473). Genes were more often lost than acquired, and prophage genes were more variable than bacterial genes. We identified genes that were lost or acquired independently across different clonal lineages, i.e. convergent molecular evolution. Convergent evolution suggests that there is a selection for loss and acquisition of certain genes in the host environment. We find that a significant proportion of such genes are associated with virulence; a trait previously shown to be important for adaptation. Furthermore, we also compared the genomes across lineages to show that within-lineage variable genes more often belonged to genomic content not shared across all lineages. Finally, we used 4,760 genes shared by 446 P. aeruginosa genomes to develop a stable and discriminatory typing scheme for P. aeruginosa clone types (Pactyper, https://github.com/MigleSur/Pactyper). In sum, our analysis adds to the knowledge on the pace and drivers of gene loss and acquisition in bacteria evolving over multiple years in a human host environment and provides a basis to further understand how gene loss and acquisition plays a role in lineage differentiation and host adaptation.

Although other mechanisms that contribute to this decision have been studied until now, a 7-genes-operon with a disposition and homology shared with the wsp operon in Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained to be investigated. In this work, we characterized the function of P. putida wsp operon by the combination of deletion mutants with complementations with P. aeruginosas genes and with deletions of 3 other genes: the genes that code for the transcription factors fleQ and fleN and the flagellar movement regulator, fglZ. Examining mutant behaviour at 6 and 24 hours under three different carbon regimes (citrate, glucose and fructose) we saw that this complex carries out a similar function in both Pseudomonas. In P. putida, the key components are WspR, a protein that harbours the domain for producing c-di-GMP, and WspF, which controls its activity. Transformation with the equivalent proteins of P. aeruginosa had a significant impact on of P. putida mutant phenotypes and could complement their functions under some conditions.

Here, we validate a model system to identify genes involved in biofilm growth and antibiotic resistance.

Our model employs a genomics-driven workflow to assemble the complete MPAO1 genome, identify unique and conserved genes by comparative genomics with the PAO1 reference strain and missed genes by proteogenomics. Among over 200 unique MPAO1 genes, we identified six general essential genes that were overlooked when mapping public Tn-seq datasets against PAO1, including an antitoxin. Genomic data were integrated with phenotypic data from an experimental workflow using a user-friendly, soft lithography-based microfluidic flow chamber for biofilm growth. Experiments conducted across three laboratories delivered reproducible data on P. aeruginosa biofilms and validated both known and novel genes involved in biofilm growth and antibiotic resistance identified in screens of the mutant collection. Differential protein expression data from planktonic cells versus biofilm confirmed upregulation of candidates known to affect biofilm formation, of structural and secreted proteins of type six secretion systems, and provided proteogenomic evidence for some missed MPAO1 genes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106026,Phytochemical screening and antimicrobial activities studies of Acacia nilotica fruit cover,"This study was carried out in Khartoum state, during November, 2019. Acacia nilotica was chosen for this study because of its using traditionally in treatment of many diseases. The Phytochemical constitutions of A. nilotica were investigated with aim to identify the antimicrobial effects of this plant. The dried fruit cover of Acacia nilotica was extracted successively with petroleum-ether, chloroform, methanol and distilled water. The phytochemical screening carried out on different extracts of Acacia nilotica fruit cover showed high amount of Glycosides, Flavonoids and Terpenoids (in all extracts) and moderate amount of Tannin in methanol and distilled water extracts, Alkaloids (acid and base) in methanol extract and Saponin in methanol and petroleum-ether extracts. The antimicrobial activity of extracts were evaluated against four standard bacteria species (gram positive bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and (gram negative bacteria; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli). The plates were inoculated for sensitivity testing, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was measured. The results of antimicrobial investigation show that the distilled water and methanolic extracts inhibited the growth of all microorganisms (Specified by the zone of inhibition). The results provide promising baseline information for potential use of these crude extracts in drug development programs in the pharmaceutical industries.","Abdalla, A. A.; Mustafa, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106134,Structure of heme d1-free cd1 nitrite reductase NirS,"A key step in anaerobic nitrate respiration is the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide, which is catalysed by cd1 nitrite reductase NirS in e.g. the gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each subunit of this homodimeric enzyme consists of a cytochrome c domain and an eight-bladed {beta}-propeller that binds the uncommon isobacteriochlorin heme d1 as an essential part of its active site. Although NirS is mechanistically and structurally well studied, the focus of previous studies has been on the active, heme d1-bound form. The heme d1-free form of NirS reported here, representing a premature state of the reductase, adopts an open conformation with the cytochrome c domains moved away from each other with respect to the active enzyme. Further, movement of a loop around W498 seems to be related to a widening of the propeller, allowing easier access to the heme d1 binding side. Finally, a possible link between the open conformation of NirS and flagella formation in P. aeruginosa is discussed.

SynopsisThe crystal structure of heme d1-free cd1 nitrite reductase NirS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been determined and provides insight into a premature form of the enzyme.","Kluenemann, T.; Blankenfeldt, W.",2020-02-13,Biochemistry,10.1101/2020.02.12.945543,1,Wulf  Blankenfeldt,Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945543v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.12.945543v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106222,Competitive binding of independent extension and retraction motors explains the quantitative dynamics of type IV pili,"The functions of type IV pili (TFP) are mediated by cycles of extension and retraction. The coordination of these cycles remains mysterious due to poor quantification of TFP dynamics. Here we fluorescently label the TFP in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and track the full extension and retraction cycles of individual TFP to quantify their dynamics. We test several models for the switch between extension and retraction using quantitative experiments, biophysical modeling and genetics. We invalidate the prominent hypothesis that this switch is triggered by surface contact. Instead, we show that the entire repetitive cycle of extension and retraction of individual TFP is governed by the stochastic binding of antagonistic extension and retraction motors and explain how this mechanism quantitatively defines physiologically-important features like TFP length and their production rate. Interestingly, our results suggest that the major throttle of TFP production is the unbinding of the retraction motor.","Koch, M. D.; Fei, C.; Wingreen, N. S.; Shaevitz, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106207,"Characterising the mechanism of action of an ancient antimicrobial, honey, using modern transcriptomics","Manuka honey has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and unlike traditional antibiotics, resistance to its killing effects has not been reported. However, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism of action of manuka honey and its key antibacterial components using a transcriptomic approach in a model organism, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that no single component of honey can account for its total antimicrobial action, and that honey affects the expression of genes in the SOS response, oxidative damage and quorum sensing. Manuka honey uniquely affects genes involved in the explosive cell lysis process and in maintaining the electron transport chain, causing protons to leak across membranes and collapsing the proton motive force; and induces membrane depolarisation and permeabilisation in P. aeruginosa. These data indicate that the activity of manuka honey comes from multiple mechanisms of action that do not engender bacterial resistance.

ImportanceThe threat of antimicrobial resistance to human health has prompted interest in complex, natural products with antimicrobial activity. Honey has been an effective topical wound treatment throughout history, predominantly due to its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Unlike traditional antibiotics, honey-resistant bacteria have not been reported, however, honey remains underutilised in the clinic in part due to a lack of understanding of its mechanism of action. Here we demonstrate that honey affects multiple processes in bacteria, and this is not explained by its major antibacterial components. Honey also uniquely affects bacterial membranes and this can be exploited for combination therapy with antibiotics that are otherwise ineffective on their own. We argue that honey should be included as part of the current array of wound treatments due to its effective antibacterial activity that does not promote resistance in bacteria.","Bouzo, D.; Cokcetin, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106543,"Diversity of culturable actinobacteria producing protease inhibitors from the intertidal zones of Maharashtra, India","Phylogenetic diversity of culturable actinobacteria isolated from the intertidal regions of west coast of Maharashtra, India was studied using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Total of 140 actinobacterial isolates were obtained, which belonged to 14 genera, 10 families and 65 putative species with Streptomyces being the most dominant (63%) genus followed by Nocardiopsis and Micromonospora. They were screened for production of extracellular protease inhibitors (PI) against three pure proteases viz. chymotrypsin, trypsin, subtilisin and one crude extracellular protease from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eighty percent of the isolates showed PI activity against at least one of the four proteases, majority of them belonged to genus Streptomyes. Actinobacterial diversity from two sites Ade (17{degrees}52' N, 73{degrees}04' E) and Harnai (17{degrees}48' N, 73{degrees}05' E) with varying degree of anthropological pressure showed that more putative species diversity was obtained from site with lower human intervention i.e Ade (Shannons H 3.45) than from Harnai (Shannons H 2.83), a site with more human intervention. Further, in Ade percentage of isolates not showing PI activity against any of the proteases was close to 21% and that in Harnai was close to 9%. Considering human activities in the coastal region might be contributing to increasing the organic load and in turn increasing the presence of extracellular enzymes in the intertidal environments it would be interesting to look at the association of PI production and organic load in these habitats.","Shintre, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106592,Structure of the Lifeact F-actin complex,"Lifeact is a short actin-binding peptide that is used to visualize filamentous actin (F-actin) structures in live eukaryotic cells using fluorescence microscopy. However, this popular probe has been shown to alter cellular morphology by affecting the structure of the cytoskeleton. The molecular basis for such artefacts is poorly understood. Here, we determined the high-resolution structure of the Lifeact-F-actin complex using electron cryo-microscopy. The structure reveals that Lifeact interacts with a hydrophobic binding pocket on F-actin and stretches over two adjacent actin subunits, stabilizing the DNase I-binding loop of actin in the closed conformation. Interestingly, the hydrophobic binding site is also used by actin-binding proteins, such as cofilin and myosin and actin-binding toxins, such as TccC3HVR from Photorhabdus luminescens and ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In vitro binding assays and activity measurements demonstrate that Lifeact indeed competes with these proteins, providing an explanation for the altering effects of Lifeact on cell morphology in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that the affinity of Lifeact to F-actin can be increased by introducing mutations into the peptide, laying the foundation for designing improved actin probes for live cell imaging.","Belyy, A.; Merino, F.; Sitsel, O.; Raunser, S.",2020-02-16,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2020.02.16.951269,1,Stefan  Raunser,Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951269v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.16.951269v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000925
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,106743,Semiautomated Detection Of Pseudomonas aeruginosa From Diverse Water Samples Using Highly Selective Z-Broth And Redoxpotential Monitor,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a facultative bacterial pathogen with increasing public health risk potential. Contaminated water in hospital environments is a growing cause of multidrug-resistent P. aeruginosa nosocomial infections that are life-threatening and are costly to treat. P. aeruginosa is common in natural water bodies, but it is not unusual in drinking water and has been detected in bottled water, also. Suppliers in Europe must eliminate live forms of the bacterium in drinking water to meet human consumption requirements. Laboratory testing for the presence of viable P. aeruginosa is mostly done manually using culture media but conductance/impedimetry measurements for detection are also available. In order to improve expedience and cost efficiency as well as to automate the detection and the data registration, we applied the highly selective Z-broth culture media and redox potential monitoring to detect P. aeruginosa from water. The Z-broth is based on only a few, stable chemicals that provide consistency of quality and long shelf life. It limits growth to P. aeruginosa and, thus, eliminates the need for subsequent microbiological identification steps of the European Standard procedure defined in ISO 16 266:2006 (2018). A redox potential monitor was used in this work, that simultaneously recorded 64 sample curves and automatically marked positive samples reliably within 24 hours after sample initialization. In comparison, the standard method requires additional tests that prolongs identification to some days. Practical applicability and reliability of the method in this paper was demonstrated by testing a total of 739 water samples of which 222 were tap water, 342 well water and 145 had been taken from swimming pools.

It is considered this method is well suited to process large numbers of samples for purposes of detecting P. aeruginosa contamination with relative ease, little cost in shortened time. Using Z-broth in combination with redox potential monitoring can be recommended for central laboratories for routine testing of drinking water for live P. aeruginosa presence. As well, using this method for testing of fluids and surfaces for P. aeruginosa contamination would be advantageous in such environments as the hospital industry, swimming pools and spas, where cleaning routines and P. aeruginosa transmission prevention protocols could be made much more resultful and cost-effective due to ease and speed of processing both spot check and water samples.

Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) including Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP), are among the World Health Organization and National Institutes of Healths high priority MDR pathogens for targeted development of new therapies. Here we show that stabilizing the hosts vasculature by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) increases survival rates of mice infected with A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, CPKP pneumonia. We show that pharmacological inhibition of ARF6-GTP phenocopies endothelial-specific Arf6 disruption in enhancing survival of mice with A. baumannii pneumonia, suggesting that inhibition is on target. Finally, we show that the mechanism of protection elicited by these small molecule inhibitors is by restoration of vascular integrity disrupted by GNB lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of TLR4/MyD88/ARNO/ARF6 pathway. By targeting the hosts vasculature with small molecule inhibitors of ARF6 activation, we circumvent microbial drug resistance and provide a potential alternative/adjunctive treatment for emerging and re-emerging pathogens.","Gebremariam, T.; Zhang, L.; Alkhazraji, S.; Gu, Y.; Youssef, E.; Tong, Z.; Kish-Trier, E.; Araujo, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,107284,The crystal structure of heme d1 biosynthesis-associated small c-type cytochrome NirC reveals mixed oligomeric states in crystallo,"Monoheme c-type cytochromes are important electron transporters in all domains of life. They possess a common fold hallmarked by three -helices that surround a covalently attached heme. An intriguing feature of many monoheme c-type cytochromes is their capacity to form oligomers by exchanging at least one of their -helices, which is often referred to as 3D domain swapping. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of NirC, a c-type cytochrome co-encoded with other proteins involved in nitrite reduction by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Crystals diffracted anisotropically to a maximum resolution of 2.12 [A] (spherical resolution 2.83 [A]) and initial phases were obtained by Fe-SAD phasing, revealing the presence of eleven NirC chains in the asymmetric unit. Surprisingly, these protomers arrange into one monomer and two different types of 3D-domain-swapped dimers, one showing pronounced asymmetry. While the simultaneous observation of monomers and dimers probably reflects the interplay between high protein concentration required for crystallization and the structural plasticity of monoheme c-type cytochromes, the identification of conserved structural motifs in the monomer together with a comparison to similar proteins may offer new leads to unravel the unknown function of NirC.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,107576,Structure and conformational cycle of a bacteriophage-encoded chaperonin,"Chaperonins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones found in all domains of life. They form ring-shaped complexes that assist in the folding of substrate proteins in an ATP-dependent reaction cycle. Key to the folding cycle is the transient encapsulation of substrate proteins by the chaperonin. Here we present a structural and functional characterization of the chaperonin gp146 ({phi}EL) from the phage EL of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. {phi}EL, an evolutionary distant homolog of bacterial GroEL, is active in ATP hydrolysis and prevents the aggregation of denatured protein in a nucleotide-dependent manner. However, {phi}EL failed to refold the encapsulation-dependent model substrate rhodanese and did not interact with E. coli GroES, the lid-shaped co-chaperone of GroEL. {phi}EL forms tetradecameric double-ring complexes, which dissociate into single rings in the presence of ATP. Crystal structures of {phi}EL (at 3.54 and 4.03 [A]) in presence of ATP*BeFx revealed two distinct single-ring conformational states, both with open access to the ring cavity. One state showed uniform ATP-bound subunit conformations (symmetric state), whereas the second combined distinct ATP- and ADP-bound subunit conformations (asymmetric state). Cryo-electron microscopy of apo-{phi}EL revealed a double-ring structure composed of rings in the asymmetric state (3.45 [A] resolution). We propose that the phage chaperonin undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational switching between double- and single rings and functions in aggregation prevention without substrate protein encapsulation. Thus, {phi}EL may represent an evolutionary more ancient chaperonin prior to acquisition of the encapsulation mechanism.","Hayer-Hartl, M.; Bracher, A.; Paul, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,107710,Predicting antibiotic-associated virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using an ex-vivo lung biofilm model,"BackgroundBacterial biofilms are known to have high antibiotic tolerance which directly affects clearance of bacterial infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Current antibiotic susceptibility testing methods are either based on planktonic cells or do not reflect the complexity of biofilms in vivo. Consequently, inaccurate diagnostics affect treatment choice, preventing bacterial clearance and potentially selecting for antibiotic resistance. This leads to prolonged, ineffective treatment.

MethodsIn this study, we use an ex-vivo lung biofilm model to study antibiotic tolerance and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sections of pig bronchiole were dissected, prepared and infected with clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa and incubated in artificial sputum media to form biofilms, as previously described. Then, lung-associated biofilms were challenged with antibiotics, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, before their bacterial load and virulence were quantified and detected, respectively.

ResultsThe results demonstrated minimal effect on the bacterial load with therapeutically relevant concentrations of ciprofloxacin and meropenem, with the later causing an increased production of proteases and pyocyanin. A combination of meropenem and tobramycin did not show any additional decrease in bacterial load but demonstrated a slight decrease in total proteases and pyocyanin production.

ConclusionsWe demonstrate a realistic model for understanding antibiotic resistance and tolerance in biofilms clinically and for molecules screening in anti-biofilm drug development. P. aeruginosa showed high levels of antibiotic tolerance, with minimal effect on bacterial load and increased proteases production, which could negatively affect lung function. This may potentially contribute to exacerbations and eventual lung failure.","Hassan, M. M.; Harrington, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,107780,Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates co-incubated with Acanthamoeba castellanii exhibit phenotypes similar to chronic cystic fibrosis isolates,"The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is ubiquitous in the environment, and in humans is capable of causing acute and chronic infections. P. aeruginosa, when co-incubated with the bacterivorous amoeba, Acanthamoeba castellanii, for extended periods, produced genetic and phenotypic variants. Sequencing of late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa isolates demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms within genes that encode known virulence factors, and this correlated with a reduction in expression of virulence traits. Virulence towards the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was attenuated in late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa compared to early stage amoeba-adapted and non-adapted counterparts. Late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa lost competitive fitness compared to non-adapted counterparts when grown in nutrient rich media. However, non-adapted P. aeruginosa were rapidly cleared by amoeba predation, whereas late-stage amoeba-adapted isolates remained in higher numbers 24 h after ingestion by amoeba. In addition, there was reduced uptake by macrophage of amoeba-adapted isolates and reduced uptake by human neutrophils as well as increased survival in the presence of neutrophils. Our findings indicate that the selection imposed by amoeba on P. aeruginosa resulted in reduced virulence over time. Importantly, the genetic and phenotypic traits possessed by late-stage amoeba-adapted P. aeruginosa are similar to what is observed for isolates obtained from chronic cystic fibrosis infections. This notable overlap in adaptation to different host types suggests similar selection pressures among host cell types.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute infections in plants and animals, including humans and also causes chronic infections in immune compromised and cystic fibrosis patients. This bacterium is commonly found in soils and water where bacteria are constantly under threat of being consumed by the bacterial predators, protozoa. To escape being killed, bacteria have evolved a suite of mechanisms that protect them from being consumed or digested. Here we examined the effect of long-term predation on the genotype and phenotypes expressed by P. aeruginosa. We show that long-term co-incubation with protozoa resulted in mutations in the bacteria that made them less pathogenic. This is particularly interesting as we see similar mutations arise in bacteria associated with chronic infections. Thus, predation by protozoa and long term colonization of the human host may represent similar environments that select for similar losses in gene functions.","Leong, W.; Lutz, C.; Williams, J.; Poh, Y.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,107931,Antagonistic interactions subdue inter-species green-beard cooperation in bacteria.,"Cooperation can be favored through the green-beard mechanism, where a set of linked genes encodes both a cooperative trait and a phenotypic marker (green beard), which allows carriers of the trait to selectively direct cooperative acts to other carriers. In theory, the green-beard mechanism should favor cooperation even when interacting partners are totally unrelated at the genome level. Here, we explore such an extreme green-beard scenario between two unrelated bacterial species - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia, which share a cooperative locus encoding the public good pyochelin (a siderophore) and its cognate receptor (green beard) required for iron-pyochelin uptake. We show that pyochelin, when provided in cell-free supernatants, can be mutually exchanged between species and provide fitness benefits under iron limitation. However, in co-culture we observed that these cooperative benefits vanished and communities were dominated by P. aeruginosa, regardless of strain background and species starting frequencies. Our results further suggest that P. aeruginosa engages in interference competition to suppress B. cenocepacia, indicating that inter-species conflict arising from dissimilarities at the genome level overrule the aligned cooperative interests at the pyochelin locus. Thus, green-beard cooperation is subdued by competition, indicating that inter-specific siderophore cooperation is difficult to evolve and to be maintained.","Sathe, S.; Kuemmerli, R.",2020-02-26,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2020.02.25.965665,1,Santosh  Sathe,"University of Zurich, CH-8057 Zurich Switzerland",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.965665v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.25.965665v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/jeb.13666
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,108113,Model of ciprofloxacin subdiffusion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formed in artificial sputum medium,"We study theoretically and empirically ciprofioxacin antibiotic diffusion through a gel-like artificial sputum medium (ASM) mimicking physiological conditions typical for a cystic fibrosis layer, in which regions occupied by Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria are present. Our theoretical model is based on the subdiffusion-absorption equation with a fractional time derivative that describes molecules diffusion in a medium structured as Thompsons plumpudding model; the pudding  background represents ASM and the plums represent the bacterial biofilm. We show that the process can be divided into three successive stages: (1) only antibiotic subdiffusion with constant biofilm parameters, (2) subdiffusion and absorption of antibiotic molecules with variable biofilm parameters, (3) subdiffusion and absorption in the medium but biofilm parameters are constant. Stage 2 is interpreted as the appearance of an intensive defence bulid-up of bacteria against the action of an antibiotic, in the stage 3 it is likely that the bacteria have been inactivated. Times at which stages change are determined from the experimentally obtained temporal evolution of the amount of substance that has diffused through the ASM with bacteria. Our analysis shows good agreement between experimental and our theoretical results.","Kosztołowicz, T.; Metzler, R.; Wasik, S.; Arabski, M.",2020-03-27,Biophysics,10.1101/2020.02.26.966507,2,Tadeusz  Kosztołowicz,"Institute of Physics, Jan Kochanowski University, Uniwersytecka 7, 25-406 Kielce, Poland",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.966507v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.26.966507v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1371/journal.pone.0243003
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,108715,Role of RgsA in oxidative stress resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extremely common opportunistic pathogen in clinical practice. Patients with metabolic disorders, hematologic diseases, malignancies, who have undergone surgery or who have received certain treatments are susceptible to this bacterium. In addition, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant that tends to form biofilms and is refractory to treatment. Small regulatory RNAs are RNA molecules that are 40-500 nucleotides long, possess regulatory function, are ubiquitous in bacteria, and are also known as small RNA (sRNA). sRNAs play important regulatory roles in various vital life processes in diverse bacteria and their quantity and diversity of regulatory functions exceeds that of proteins. In this study, we showed that deletion of the sRNA RgsA decreases the growth rate and ability to resist different concentrations and durations of peroxide in P. aeruginosa. These decreases occur not only in the planktonic state, but also in the biofilm state. Finally, protein mass spectrometry was employed to understand changes in the entire protein spectrum. The results presented herein provide a description of the role of RgsA in the life activities of P. aeruginosa at the molecular, phenotypic, and protein levels.","Hou, S.; Zhang, J.; Ma, X.; Hong, Q.; Fang, L.; Zheng, G.; Huang, J.; Gao, Y.; Xu, Q.; Zhuang, X.; Song, X.",2020-03-03,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.03.974683,1,Shuyi  Hou,xiang'an hospital of xiamen,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.974683v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.974683v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1007/s00284-021-02580-z

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,109013,ThiL is a valid antibacterial target that is essential for both thiamine biosynthesis and salvage pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is an essential cofactor for various pivotal cellular processes in all living organisms, including bacteria. As thiamine biosynthesis occurs in bacteria but not humans, bacterial thiamine biosynthesis is an attractive target for antibiotic development. Among enzymes in the thiamine biosynthetic pathway, thiamine monophosphate kinase (ThiL) catalyzes the final step of the pathway, phosphorylating thiamine monophosphate (TMP) to produce TPP. In this work, we extensively investigated ThiL in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen of hospital-acquired infections. We demonstrated that thiL deletion abolishes not only thiamine biosynthesis but also thiamine salvage capability, showing growth defects of the {Delta}thiL mutant even in the presence of thiamine derivatives except TPP. Most importantly, the pathogenesis of the {Delta}thiL mutant was markedly attenuated compared to wild-type bacteria, with lower inflammatory cytokine induction and 103~104 times decreased bacterial load in an in vivo infection model where the intracellular TPP level is in the submicromolar range. In order to validate P. aeruginosa ThiL (PaThiL) as a new drug target, we further characterized its biochemical properties determining a Vmax of 4.0{+/-}0.2 nomol{middle dot}min-1 and KM values of 111{+/-}8 and 8.0{+/-}3.5M for ATP and TMP, respectively. A subsequent in vitro small molecule screening identified PaThiL inhibitors including WAY213613 that is a noncompetitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 13.4{+/-}2.3 M and a potential antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. This study proved that PaThiL is a new drug target against P. aeruginosa providing comprehensive biological and biochemical data that could facilitate to develop a new repertoire of antibiotics.","Kim, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,109648,Rhamnolipid production from waste cooking oil using newly isolated halotolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa M4,"This study isolated a novel halotolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa M4, that was able to degrade oil and produce rhamnolipids. Various carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inoculum ratio, pH, and temperature were tested to optimize the oil degradation conditions. The highest oil degradation rate of 85.20 % and lipase activity of 23.86 U/mL were obtained under the optimal conditions (5% inoculum at 35 {degrees}C and pH 8). The components of degradation products at different times were analyzed to explore the mechanism of oil degradation by GC-MS. Short chain fatty acid of acetic and n-butyric acids were the primary degradation intermediates. P. aeruginosa M4 had good salt tolerance up to 70 g/L. The maximum rhamnolipid concentration of 1119.87 mg/L was produced when P. aeruginosa M4 used waste cooking oil as the sole carbon source. Rhamnose precursors were synthesized from glycerol, a hydrolysis product of waste cooking oil. R-3-hydroxyalkanoate precursors were synthesized de novo using acetyl-CoA produced from {beta}-oxidation of fatty acids. The findings show that P. aeruginosa M4 is a valuable biosurfactant producer in the treatment of waste cooking oil.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,109969,Filamentous Bacteriophage Delay Healing of Pseudomonas-Infected Wounds,"We have identified a novel role for filamentous bacteriophage in the delayed healing associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) wound infections. Pf phage delays wound re-epithelialization in the absence of live Pa, indicative that Pf effects on wound healing are independent of Pa pathogenesis. Pf phage directly inhibits autocrine signaling of CXCL1 (KC) to impede keratinocyte migration and wound re-epithelization. In agreement with these studies, a prospective cohort study of 36 human patients with chronic Pa wound infections revealed that wounds infected with Pf positive strains of Pa took longer to heal and were more likely to increase in size compared to wounds infected with Pf negative strains. Together, these data implicate Pf phage in the delayed wound healing associated with Pa infection through direct manipulation of mammalian target cells. We propose that Pf phage may have potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target in delayed wound healing.","Bach, M. S.; De Vries, C. R.; Khosravi, A.; Sweere, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,110028,Methods for Extraction and Detection of Bacteriophage DNA from the Sputum of Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"There is increasing interest in the pulmonary microbiomes bacterial and viral communities, particularly in the context of chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the isolation of microbial DNA from the sputum from patients with CF is technically challenging and the optimal protocols for the analysis of viral species, including bacteriophage, from clinical samples remains challenging. Here, we evaluate a set of methods developed for processing and analyzing sputum from patients with CF with a particular emphasis on detecting bacteriophage viron-derived nucleic acid. We evaluate the impact of bead-beating, deoxyribonuclease digestion, and heating steps in these protocols focusing on the quantitative assessment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pf bacteriophage in sputum as a proof of concept. Based on these comparative data, we describe an optimized protocol for processing sputum from patients with CF and isolating DNA for PCR or sequencing-based studies. These studies will facilitate future assessments of bacteriophage and bacteria in sputum from patients with CF.

Author SummaryPatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have thickened secretions and develop chronic infections in their airways. While we culture bacterial pathogens from expectorated sputum this method favors detection of certain organisms. There is greater understanding that the microbiome with in the airway of patients with cystic fibrosis is varied and contains more than just the bacteria that we selectively culture. Processing sputum is difficult as it is very thick. There are many different ways to process sputum depending on what aspect of the sputum is to be studied. We have an interest in a specific bacteriophage, or a virus that infects bacteria. We sought to find the best method to take sputum from a CF patient and extract DNA so that we could detect both bacteria and bacteriophage DNA. We compared different methods that included different combinations of heat, mechanical homogenization, chemical lysis and DNA extraction by commercially available kits. We describe the method we found easiest to execute and produced the best yield for detection of both bacteria and bacteriophage. Our purpose of publishing this method in detail is to facilitate further study of viral and bacterial communities in the sputum of patients with CF.","Burgener, E. B.; Secor, P. R.; Tracy, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,110287,The analysis of the role of MexAB-OprM on quorum sensing homeostasis shows that the apparent redundancy of Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug efflux pumps allows keeping the robustness and the plasticity of this intercellular signaling network,"Multidrug efflux pumps are key determinants for antibiotic resistance. Besides contributing to intrinsic resistance, their overexpression is frequently a cause of the increased resistance acquired during therapy. In addition to their role in resistance to antimicrobials, efflux pumps are ancient and conserved elements with relevant roles in different aspects of the bacterial physiology. It is then conceivable that their overexpression might cause a burden that will be translated into a fitness cost associated with the acquisition of resistance. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has been stated that overexpression of different efflux pumps is linked to the impairment of the quorum sensing (QS) response. Nevertheless, the causes of such impairment are different for each analyzed efflux pump. In this study, we performed an in-depth analysis of the QS-mediated response of a P. aeruginosa antibiotic resistant mutant that overexpresses MexAB-OprM. Although previous work claimed that this efflux pump extrudes the QS signal 3-oxo-C12-HSL, we show otherwise. Our results suggest that the observed attenuation in the QS response when overexpressing this pump is related to a reduced availability of intracellular octanoate, one of the precursors of the biosynthesis of alkyl quinolone QS signals. The overexpression of other P. aeruginosa efflux pumps has been shown to also cause a reduction in intracellular levels of QS signals or their precursors impacting on these signaling mechanisms. However, the molecules involved are distinct for each efflux pump, indicating that they can differentially contribute to the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing homeostasis.

ImportanceThe success of bacterial pathogens to cause disease relies on their virulence capabilities as well as in their resistance to antibiotic interventions. In the case of the important nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug efflux pumps participate in the resistance/virulence crosstalk since, besides contributing to antibiotic resistance, they can also modulate the quorum sensing (QS) response. We show that mutants overexpressing the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, present an impaired QS response due to the reduced availability of the QS signal precursor octanoate, not because they extrude, as previously stated, the QS signal 3-oxo-C12-HSL. Together with previous studies, this indicates that, although the consequences of overexpressing efflux pumps are similar (impaired QS response), the mechanisms are different. This  apparent redundancy of RND efflux systems can be understood as a P. aeruginosa strategy to keep the robustness of the QS regulatory network and modulate its output in response to different signals.","Alcalde-Rico, M.; Olivares-Pacheco, J.; Halliday, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,110430,ICEs are the main reservoirs of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene was recently identified in a plasmid isolated from a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. Homologues of this gene were also identified in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. We set out to explore the mobile genetic elements involved in the acquisition and spread of this gene in publicly available and complete genomes of Pseudomonas. The crpP gene was identified only in P. aeruginosa, in more than half of the complete chromosomes (61.9%, n=133/215) belonging to 52 sequence types, of which the high-risk clone ST111 was the most frequent. We identified 136 crpP-harboring ICEs, with 93.4% belonging to the mating-pair formation G (MPFG) family. The ICEs were integrated at the end of a tRNALys gene and were all flanked by highly conserved 45-bp direct repeats. The core ICEome contains 26 genes (2.2% of all genes), which are present in 99% or more of the crpP-harboring ICEs. The most frequently encoded traits on these ICEs include replication, transcription, intracellular trafficking and cell motility. Our work reveals that ICEs are the main vectors promoting the dissemination of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene in P. aeruginosa.

Impact StatementA high proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to this antibiotic is often mediated by chromosomal mutations, but recently horizontally transferred genes have been identified. We assessed the repartition of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene among Pseudomonas genomes and we characterized the mobile elements associated with its acquisition. We found that this gene is prevalent in P. aeruginosa and frequently associated with integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Importantly, we also identified highly conserved direct repeats that can be used to accurately delimit crpP-carrying ICEs in P. aeruginosa genomes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,110929,Membrane-Interactive Compounds from Pistacia lentiscus L. Thwart Pseudomonas aeruginosa Virulence,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable to deploy a collection of virulence factors that are not only essential for host infection and persistence, but also to escape from the host immune system and to become more resistant to drug therapies. Thus, developing anti-virulence agents that may directly counteract with specific virulence factors or disturb higher regulatory pathways controlling the production of virulence armories are urgently needed. In this regard, this study reports that Pistacia lentiscus L. fruit cyclohexane extract (PLFE1) thwarts P. aeruginosa virulence by targeting mainly the pyocyanin pigment production by interfering with 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines molecules production. Importantly, the anti-virulence activity of PLFE1 appears to be associated with membrane homeostasis alteration through the modulation of SigX, an extracytoplasmic function sigma factor involved in cell wall stress response. A thorough chemical analysis of PLFE1 allowed us to identify the ginkgolic acid (C17:1) and hydroginkgolic acid (C15:0) as the main bioactive membrane-interactive compounds responsible for the observed increased membrane stiffness and anti-virulence activity against P. aeruginosa. This study delivers a promising perspective for the potential future use of PLFE1 or ginkgolic acid molecules as an adjuvant therapy to fight against P. aeruginosa infections.","Tahrioui, A.; Ortiz, S.; Azuama, O.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,111209,Genomic Surveillance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the Philippines from 2013-2014,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen often causing nosocomial infections that are resilient to treatment due to an extensive repertoire of intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms. In recent years, increasing resistance rates to antibiotics such as carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins have been reported, as well as multi-drug resistant and possible extremely drug-resistant rates of approximately 21% and 15%, respectively. However, the molecular epidemiology and AMR mechanisms of this pathogen remains largely uncharacterized.

We sequenced the whole genomes of 176 P. aeruginosa isolates collected in 2013-2014 by the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program. The multi-locus sequence type, presence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants, and relatedness between the isolates were derived from the sequence data. The concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was also determined.

Carbapenem resistance was associated namely with loss-of function of the OprD porin, and acquisition of the metallo-{beta}-lactamase VIM. The concordance between phenotypic and genotypic resistance was 93.27% overall for 6 antibiotics in 3 classes, but varied widely between aminoglycosides. The population of P. aeruginosa in the Philippines was diverse, with clonal expansions of XDR genomes belonging to multi-locus sequence types ST235, ST244, ST309, and ST773. We found evidence of persistence or reintroduction of the predominant clone ST235 in one hospital, as well as transfer between hospitals. Most of the ST235 genomes formed a distinct Philippine lineage when contextualized with international genomes, thus raising the possibility that this is a lineage unique to the Philippines. This was further supported by long-read sequencing of one representative XDR isolate, which revealed the presence of an integron carrying multiple resistance genes, including blaVIM-2, with differences in gene composition and synteny to other P. aeruginosa class 1 integrons described before.

We produced the first comprehensive genomic survey of P. aeruginosa in the Philippines, which bridges the gap in genomic data from the Western Pacific region and will constitute the genetic background to contextualize ongoing prospective surveillance. Our results also highlight the importance of infection control interventions aimed to curtail the spread of international epidemic clone ST235 within the country.","Chilam, J.; Argimon, S.; Limas, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,111172,The GspLM inner membrane complex from the bacterial type II secretion system is a dimer of dimers and interacts with the system ATPase with high affinity,"ABSTACTThe type II secretion system (T2SS) is a multiprotein machinery spanning the diderm of gram-negative bacteria. T2SS contributes to the virulence of numerous gram-negative pathogens, including the multidrug resistant species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumonia and Vibrio cholerae. Even though the T2SS has been studied extensively over the past three decades, our understanding of the molecular basis of its biogenesis and of its overall structure still remains unclear. Here we show that the core component of the inner membrane platform, the GspLM membrane protein complex, can be isolated as a dimer of dimers. Importantly, the complex is able to bind the T2SS ATPase, GspE, with high affinity. Finally, we have developed single domain VHH camelid antibodies (nanobodies) against the GspLM complex and have identified a nanobody that effectively prevents the cytoplasmic domain of GspL, GspLcyto, from binding to GspE. Our findings suggest that the T2SS ATPase is permanently associated with the inner membrane platform and that the GspELM complex should be considered as a key subassembly for the biogenesis of the T2SS apparatus.","Fulara, A.; Ramou, I.; Savvides, S.

These results demonstrate the presence of indigenous bacteria in hydrocarbon polluted soils and the potential towards remediation of hydrocarbons.","Ibuot, A.",2020-03-24,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.21.998872,1,Aniefon  Ibuot,"Akwa Ibom State Polytechnic, Nigeria",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.998872v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.21.998872v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.36462/h.biosci.20218
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,111445,The O2-independent pathway of ubiquinone biosynthesis is essential for denitrification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Many proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli, contain two main types of quinones, benzoquinones represented by ubiquinone (UQ) and naphthoquinones such as menaquinone (MK) and dimethyl-menaquinone (DMK). MK and DMK function predominantly in anaerobic respiratory chains, whereas UQ is the major electron carrier used for reduction of dioxygen. However, this division of labor is probably not so stric. Indeed, a pathway that produces UQ under anaerobic conditions in an UbiU-, UbiV- and UbiT-dependent manner has been recently discovered in E. coli while its physiological relevance is not yet understood because of the presence of MK and DMK in this bacterium. In the present study, we established that UQ9 is the single quinone of P. aeruginosa and that is required for growth under anaerobic respiration (denitrification). We demonstrated that ORFs PA3911, PA3912 and PA3913, which are homologues to the E. coli ubiT, ubiV and ubiU genes, respectively, were essential for UQ9 biosynthesis and thus for denitrification in P. aeruginosa. These three genes were hereafter called ubiTPa, ubiVPa and ubiUPa. We showed that UbiVPa accommodates a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Moreover, we demonstrated that UbiUPa and UbiTPa were able to bind UQ and that the isoprenoid tail of UQ was the structural determinant for the recognition by these Ubi proteins. Since the denitrification metabolism of P. aeruginosa is believed to be important for pathogenicity in cystic fibrosis patients, our results highlight the O2-independent UQ biosynthesis pathway as a new possible target to develop innovative antibiotics.","Vo, C.-D.-T.; Michaud, J.; Elsen, S.; Faivre, B.; Bouveret, E.; Barras, F.; Fontecave, M.; Pierrel, F.; Lombard, M.; Pelosi, L.",2020-04-04,Biochemistry,10.1101/2020.03.22.002311,2,Ludovic  Pelosi,"CNRS, CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble INP, TIMC-IMAG, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France;",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.002311v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.22.002311v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1074/jbc.RA120.013748
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,111792,Infrared absorptions as indicators for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii,"There is clinical demand for simple and contact-free diagnosis techniques in medical practice. This study shows that the infrared absorptions of volatile metabolites can be used to distinguish between the air around Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, other bacteria, and normal room air. Gas samples were collected from the air surrounding single and mixed laboratory cultures, and preliminary data on human breath samples are also presented. The infrared spectra of a variety of gasses are measured with a high resolution of 0.5 cm-1 to obtain information about the wavenumber position of the key bands. Hence, it is not necessary to specify the molecular species of biomarkers. This work also shows that discrimination rates can be improved by observing additional infrared absorptions caused by different characteristic volatile molecules. The significance of this work is that the specific wavenumber positions of the key bands that allow the application of infrared lasers are provided. As a result, it is considered that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii can be monitored more sensitively and easily. With further research and development, this simple approach could be used in future applications to identify infections in healthcare settings.","Yamamoto, M.; Arata, S.; Fukuchi, K.; Honda, H.; Kobayashi, H.; Inagaki, M.",2020-03-25,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.25.007591,1,Masato  Yamamoto,Showa University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.007591v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.25.007591v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112204,Pseudomonas aeruginosa enhances the efficacy of norfloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus biofilms,"The thick mucus within the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) promotes frequent respiratory infections that are often polymicrobial. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the most prevalent pathogens that cause CF pulmonary infections, and both have been associated with worse lung function. Furthermore, the ability of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to form biofilms promotes the establishment of chronic infections that are often difficult to eradicate using antimicrobial agents. In this study, we found that multiple LasR-regulated exoproducts of P. aeruginosa, including HQNO, siderophores, phenazines, and rhamnolipids, likely contribute to the ability of P. aeruginosa to shift S. aureus norfloxacin susceptibility profiles. Here, we observe that exposure to P. aeruginosa exoproducts leads to an increase in intracellular norfloxacin accumulation by S. aureus. We previously showed that P. aeruginosa supernatant dissipates S. aureus membrane potential, and furthermore, depletion of the S. aureus proton-motive force recapitulates the effect of P. aeruginosa supernatant on shifting norfloxacin sensitivity profiles of biofilm-grown S. aureus. From these results, we hypothesize that exposure to P. aeruginosa exoproducts leads to increased uptake of the drug and/or an impaired ability of S. aureus to efflux norfloxacin. Our results illustrate that microbially-derived products can greatly alter the ability of antimicrobial agents to kill bacterial biofilms.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are frequently co-isolated from multiple infection sites, including the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Co-infection with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus has been shown to produce worse outcomes compared to infection with one organism alone. Furthermore, the ability of these pathogens to form biofilms enables them to cause persistent infection and withstand antimicrobial therapy. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa-secreted products dramatically increase the ability of the antibiotic norfloxacin to kill S. aureus biofilms. Understanding how interspecies interactions alter the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial biofilms may inform treatment decisions and inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies.","Orazi, G.; Jean-Pierre, F.; O'toole, G.",2020-03-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.26.010959,1,George  O'toole,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010959v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.26.010959v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112172,A New High-throughput Screening (HiTS) Method for Phages - Enabling Crude Isolation and Fast Identification of Diverse Phages with Therapeutic Potential,"Bacteriophage therapy and application of phages as biocontrol in plant production and food processing, all necessitates acquisition of suitable phages. Depending on purpose, the selection criteria of phage characteristics include lifestyle (lytic/lysogenic), host range, physical stability and absence of unwanted genetic traits such as integrases, antibiotic resistance or bacterial virulence factors. The exclusivity of antibiotic resistant clinical infections and possible development of phage-resistance instigates a need to continually build sizeable phage libraries and also be able to rapidly isolate and characterise novel phages of specified bacterial hosts. Current methods for phage isolation are both laborious and time consuming, suitable only for the isolation of a limited number of phages. Thus, we developed the High-Throughput Screening (HITS) method for phages for fast isolation and identification of potentially hundreds of distinct phages against single hosts. This scalable method enables screening of hundreds of samples, in multiple simultaneous setups with varying parameters increasing the likelihood of isolating multiple distinct phages specific for the given conditions. The efficiency of the method is emphasised by our screening of 200 environmental samples, resulting in the identification of an abundance of unique phage species lytic to Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enterica, Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Olsen, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112193,Pyocin efficacy in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis,"SynopsisO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSBloodstream infections with antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa are common and increasingly difficult to treat. Pyocins are naturally occurring protein antibiotics produced by P. aeruginosa that have potential for human use.

ObjectivesTo determine if pyocin treatment is effective in a murine model of sepsis with P. aeruginosa.

MethodsRecombinant pyocins S5 and AP41 were purified tested for efficacy in a Galleria mellonella infection model and a murine model of P. aeruginosa sepsis.

ResultsBoth pyocins produced no adverse effects when injected alone into mice and showed good in vitro antipseudomonal activity. In an invertebrate model of sepsis using Galleria mellonella, both pyocins significantly prolonged survival. Following injection into mice, both showed extensive distribution into different organs. When administered 5 hours after infection, both pyocins reduced mortality, with pyocin S5 being more effective than AP41.

ConclusionsPyocins S5 and AP41 show in vivo biological activity and can improve survival in a murine model of P. aeruginosa infection. They hold promise as novel antimicrobial agents for treatment of multi-drug resistant infections with this microbe.","Six, A.; Mosbahi, K.; Barge, M.; Kleanthous, C.; Evans, T.; Walker, D.",2020-03-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.27.011908,1,Thomas  Evans,University of Glasgow,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.011908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.011908v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1093/jac/dkab199
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112724,Tamoxifen repurposing to combat infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli,"The development of new strategic therapies for multidrug-resistant bacteria, like the use of non-antimicrobial approaches and/or drugs repurposing to be used as monotherapies or in combination with clinically relevant antibiotics, has become an urgent need. A therapeutic alternative for infections by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) is immune system modulation to improve the infection clearance. We showed that immunocompetent mice infected by Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli in peritoneal sepsis models and treated with tamoxifen at 80 mg/kg/d for three days reduced the release of MCP-1 and its signalling pathway IL-18 and phosphorylated ERK1/2. This reduction of MCP-1 induced the reduction of migration of inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils from bone marrow to blood. Indeed, the treatment with tamoxifen in murine peritoneal sepsis models reduced the bacterial load in tissues and blood; and increased the mice survival from 0% to 60-100%. Tamoxifen treatment of neutropenic mice infected by these pathogens increased mice survival up to 20-60%. Furthermore, susceptibility and time-kill assays showed that the metabolites of tamoxifen, N-desmethyltamoxifen, hydroxytamoxifen and endoxifen, the three together exhibited MIC90 values of 16 mg/L and were bactericidal against clinical isolates of A. baumannii and E. coli. This antimicrobial activity of tamoxifen metabolites parallels an increased membrane permeability of A. baumannii and E. coli without affecting their outer membrane proteins profiles. Together, these data showed that tamoxifen present a therapeutic efficacy against MDR A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and E. coli in experimental models of infections and can be repurposed as new treatment for GNB infections.

ImportanceAntimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) is a global health treat. Drug repurposing, a novel approach involving the search of new indications for FDA approved drugs is gaining interest. Among them, we found the anti-cancer drug tamoxifen, which presents very promising therapeutic efficacy. The current study showed that tamoxifen presents activity in animal models of infection with MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli by modulating the traffic of innate immune system cells and the antibacterial activity presented by its three major metabolites produced in vivo against these GNB. Our results offer a new candidate to be repurposed to treat severe infections caused by these pathogens.","Miro Canturri, A.; Ayerbe Algaba, R.; Del Toro, R.; Pachon, J.; Smani, Y.",2020-04-01,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.03.30.017475,1,Younes  Smani,"Hospital Virgen del Rocío, Institute of Biomedicine of Seville",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.017475v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.017475v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3390/antibiotics10030336
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112697,Mucin glycans signal through the sensor kinase RetS to inhibit virulence-associated traits in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Mucus is a densely populated ecological niche that coats all epithelia, and plays a critical role in protecting the human body from infections. Although traditionally viewed as a physical barrier, emerging evidence suggests that mucus can directly suppress virulence traits in opportunistic pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the molecular mechanisms by which mucus affords this protection are unclear. Here, we show that mucins, and particularly their associated glycans, activate the sensor kinase RetS via its Dismed2 domain in P. aeruginosa. We find that this RetS-dependent signaling leads to the direct inhibition of the GacS-GacA two-component system, the activity of which is associated with a chronic infection state. This signaling includes the downregulation of the type VI secretion system (T6SS), and prevents T6SS-dependent bacterial killing by P. aeruginosa. Overall, these results shed light on how mucus impacts P. aeruginosa behavior in the human host, and may inspire novel approaches for controlling P. aeruginosa infections.","Wang, B. X.; Wheeler, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112702,The C-terminus is critical for the degradation of substrates by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa CtpA protease,"Bacterial carboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and have been linked to important processes including signal transduction, cell wall metabolism, and virulence. However, the features that target proteins for CTP-dependent cleavage are unclear. Studies of the Escherichia coli CTP Prc suggested that it cleaves proteins with non-polar and/or structurally unconstrained C-termini, but it is not clear if this applies broadly. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a divergent CTP, CtpA, which is required for virulence. CtpA works in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade cell wall hydrolases. Here, we investigated if the C-termini of two non-homologous CtpA substrates are important for their degradation. We determined that these substrates have extended C-termini, compared to their closest E. coli homologs. Removing seven amino acids from these extensions was sufficient to inhibit their degradation by CtpA both in vivo and in vitro. Degradation of one truncated substrate was restored by adding the C-terminus from the other, but not by adding an unrelated sequence. However, modification of the C-terminus of non-substrates, by adding the C-terminal amino acids from a substrate, did not cause their degradation by CtpA. Therefore, the C-termini of CtpA substrates are required but not sufficient for degradation. Although C-terminal truncated substrates were not degraded, they still associated with the LbcA*CtpA complex in vivo. Therefore, degradation of a protein by CtpA requires a C-terminal-independent interaction with the LbcA*CtpA complex, followed by C-terminal-dependent degradation, perhaps because CtpA must initiate cleavage at a specific C-terminal site.

IMPORTANCECarboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are found in all three domains of life, but exactly how they work is poorly understood, including how they recognize substrates. Bacterial CTPs have been associated with virulence, including CtpA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which works in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade potentially dangerous peptidoglycan hydrolases. We report an important advance by revealing that degradation by CtpA requires at least two separable phenomena, and that one of them depends on information encoded in the substrate C-terminus. A C-terminal-independent association with the LbcA*CtpA complex is followed by C-terminal-dependent cleavage by CtpA. Increased understanding of how CTPs target proteins is significant, due to their links to virulence, peptidoglycan remodeling, and other important processes.","Chung, S.; Darwin, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,112884,Invasion of epithelial cells are correlated with secretion of Biosurfactant via the type 3 secretion system (SST3) of Shigella flexneri,"Biosurfactants are amphipathic molecules produced by many microorganisms, usually bacteria, fungi and yeasts. They possess the property of reducing the tension of the membrane interfaces. No studies have been conducted on Shigella species showing their involvement of biosurfactant like molecules (BLM) in pathogenicity. This study aims to show that environmental and clinical strains of Shigella are able to produce BLM by emulsifying gasoline and diesel fuels. Our study has shown that BLM are secreted in the extracellular medium with EI24 ranging from 80 to 100%. The secretion is depending on the type III secretion system (T3SS). We did show that S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei are able to interact with hydrophobic areas with respectively 17.64%, 21.42% and 22.22% of hydrophobicity. 100 mM Benzoic and 1.5mg/mL Salycilic acids have been inhibited T3SS and this totally stops the BLM secretion. Pseudomonas aeruginosa which has T3SS is able to produce 100% of BLM in the presence or in the absence of both T3SS inhibitors. The secreted BLM is extractable with an organic solvent such as chloroform and could entirely be considered like lipopeptide or polypeptidic compound. By secreting BLM, Shigella is able to perform multicellular phenomena like ""swarming"" allowing to invade and disseminate inside epithelial cells.","Kinavouidi, D. J. K.; Kayath, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,113947,Engineered lactobacilli display anti-biofilm and growth suppressing activities against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Biofilms are an emerging target for new therapeutics in the effort to address the continued increase in resistance and tolerance to traditional antimicrobials. In particular, the distinct nature of the biofilm growth state often means that traditional antimicrobials, developed to combat planktonic cells, are ineffective. Biofilm treatments are designed to both reduce pathogen load at an infection site and decrease the development of resistance by rendering the embedded organisms more susceptible to treatment at lower antimicrobial concentrations. In this work, we developed a new antimicrobial treatment modality by characterizing the natural capacity of two lactobacilli, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus, to inhibit P. aeruginosa growth, biofilm formation, and biofilm viability. We further engineered these lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to secrete enzymes known to degrade P. aeruginosa biofilms and show that our best performing engineered LAB, secreting a pathogen-derived enzyme (PelAhyd), degrades up to 85 % of P. aeruginosa biofilm.","Chappell, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114027,Triclosan depletes the membrane potential in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms inhibiting aminoglycoside induced adaptive resistance,"Biofilm-based infections are difficult to treat due to their inherent resistance to antibiotic treatment. Discovering new approaches to enhance antibiotic efficacy in biofilms would be highly significant in treating many chronic infections. Exposure to aminoglycosides induces adaptive resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Adaptive resistance is primarily the result of active antibiotic export by RND-type efflux pumps, which use the proton motive force as an energy source. We show that the protonophore uncoupler triclosan depletes the membrane potential of biofilm growing P. aeruginosa, leading to decreased activity of RND-type efflux pumps. This disruption results in increased intracellular accumulation of tobramycin and enhanced antimicrobial activity in vitro. In addition, we show that triclosan enhances tobramycin effectiveness in vivo using a mouse wound model. Combining triclosan with tobramycin is a new anti-biofilm strategy that targets bacterial energetics, increasing the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to aminoglycosides.

Author summaryAdaptive resistance is a phenotypic response that allows P. aeruginosa to transiently survive aminoglycosides such as tobramycin. To date, few compounds have been identified that target adaptive resistance. Here, we show the protonophore uncoupler triclosan disrupts the membrane potential of P. aeruginosa. The depletion of the membrane potential reduces efflux pump activity, which is essential for adaptive resistance, leading to increased tobramycin accumulation and a shorter onset of action. Our results demonstrate that in addition to its canonical mechanism inhibiting membrane biosynthesis, triclosan can exert antibacterial properties by functioning as a protonophore that targets P. aeruginosa energetics.","Maiden, M.; Waters, C.",2020-04-14,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.04.09.034033,2,Chris  Waters,Michigan state University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.034033v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.09.034033v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008529
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114454,Investigation on the requirements for YbbN/CnoX displaying thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase and chaperone activities,"YbbN/CnoX are proteins that display a Trx domain linked to a tetratricopeptide (TPR) domain, which are involved in protein-protein interactions and protein folding processes. YbbN from Escherichia coli (EcYbbN) displays a co-chaperone (holdase) activity that is induced by HOCl (bleach). EcYbbN contains a SQHC motif within the Trx domain and displays no thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase activity. EcYbbN also presents a second Cys residue at Trx domain (Cys63) 24 residues away from SQHF motif that can form mixed disulfides with substrates. Here, we compared EcYbbN with two other YbbN proteins: from Xylella fastidiosa (XfYbbN) and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaYbbN). While EcYbbN displays two Cys residues along a SQHC[N24]C motif; XfYbbN and PaYbbN present two and three Cys residues in the CAPC[N24]V and CAPC[N24]C motifs, respectively. These three proteins are representatives of evolutionary conserved YbbN subfamilies. In contrast to EcYbbN, both XfYbbN and PaYbbN: (1) reduced an artificial disulfide (5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) = DTNB); and (2) supported the peroxidase activity of Peroxiredoxin Q from X. fastidiosa, suggesting that in vivo these proteins might function similarly to the canonical Trx enzymes. Indeed, XfYbbN was reduced by XfTrx reductase with a high catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km=1.27 x 107 M-1.s-1), like the canonical XfTrx (XfTsnC). Furthermore, EcYbbN (as described before) and XfYbbN, but not PaYbbN displayed HOCl-induced holdase activity. Remarkably, EcYbbN gained disulfide reductase activity while lost the HOCl-activated chaperone function when the SQHC was replaced by CQHC. In contrast, the XfYbbN C40A mutant lost the disulfide reductase activity, while kept its HOCl-induced chaperone function. Finally, we generated a P. aeruginosa strain with the ybbN gene deleted, which did not present increased sensitivity to heat shock or to oxidants or to reductants. Altogether, our results suggest that different YbbN/CnoX proteins display distinct properties and activities, depending on the presence of the three conserved Cys residues.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114227,Host Adaptation Predisposes Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Type VI Secretion System-Mediated Predation by the Burkholderia cepacia Complex,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) and Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) species are opportunistic lung pathogens of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). While Pa can initiate long-term infections in younger CF patients, Bcc infections only arise in teenagers and adults. Both Pa and Bcc use type VI secretion systems (T6SS) to mediate interbacterial competition. Here, we show that Pa isolates from teenage/adult CF patients, but not those from young CF patients, are outcompeted by the epidemic Bcc isolate Burkholderia cenocepacia strain AU1054 (BcAU1054) in a T6SS-dependent manner. The genomes of susceptible Pa isolates harbor T6SS-abrogating mutations, the repair of which, in some cases, rendered the isolates resistant. Moreover, seven of eight Bcc strains outcompeted Pa strains isolated from the same patients. Our findings suggest that certain mutations that arise as Pa adapts to the CF lung abrogate T6SS activity, making Pa and its human host susceptible to potentially fatal Bcc superinfection.","Perault, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114218,Changes to the resistome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clone ST308 associated with corneal infection over time,"ObjectivesThis study compared the resistomes of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clone ST308 from 2018 and 1997 from India.

MethodsTwo ocular clonal type ST308 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (198 and 219) isolated in 2018 and five historical isolates (31, 32, 33, 35 and 37) isolated in 1997 at the LV Prasad Eye Institute in India were analysed for their susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, imipenem, ceftazidime and polymyxin B. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy(R) Blood and Tissue. Paired-end library was prepared using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina(R) MiSeq bench top sequencer generating 300 bp paired-end reads. Spades v3.12.0 was used for assembly, Resfinder v3.1. for acquired resistance genes and Snippy V2 for variants calling. Integron finder v1.5.1 was used to identify the integrons present in the genomes.

ResultsThe recent isolate 219 was resistant to all tested antibiotics except polymyxin while isolate 198 was resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and tobramycin. Among historical isolates five were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, four were resistant to levofloxacin while two were resistant to polymyxin. Twenty-four acquired resistance genes were present in the 2018 isolates compared to 11 in the historical isolates. All isolates contained the following genes encoding for aminoglycoside aph(6)-Id, aph(3')-lIb, aph(3'')-Ib), beta-lactam (blaPAO), tetracycline (tet(G)), fosfomycin (fosA), chloramphenicol (catB7), sulphonamide (sul1), quaternary ammonium (qacEdelta1) and fluoroquinolone (crpP) resistance. Isolate 198 possessed aph(3')-VI, rmtD2, qnrVC1, blaOXA-488, blaPME-1, while 219 possessed aadA1, rmtB, aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaTEM-1B, blaVIM-2, mph(E), mph(A), msr(E). In the isolate 219 genes blaTEM-1b, blaVIM-2, sul1, qnrvc1, rmtB and aadA1 were carried on class 1 integron. While an incomplete class 1 integron was also found in isolate 198 which was located on the genome where gene rmtB, blaPME-1, qnrVC1 and sul1 genes were positioned. There were no notable differences in the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, but recent isolates carried more insertions and deletions in their genes.

ConclusionP. aeruginosa ocular clonal isolates have changed over time, with strains acquiring genes and having more insertions and deletions in their chromosomal genes that confirm resistance to antibiotics.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114681,One is not enough: on the effects of reference genome for the mapping and subsequent analyses of short-reads,"Mapping of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) reads to a single arbitrary reference genome is a frequently used approach in microbial genomics. However, the choice of a reference may represent a source of errors that may affect subsequent analyses such as the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and phylogenetic inference. In this work, we evaluated the effect of reference choice on short-read sequence data from five clinically and epidemiologically relevant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens). Publicly available whole-genome assemblies encompassing the genomic diversity of these species were selected as reference sequences, and read alignment statistics, SNP calling, recombination rates, dN/dS ratios, and phylogenetic trees were evaluated depending on the mapping reference. The choice of different reference genomes proved to have an impact on almost all the parameters considered in the five species. In addition, these biases had potential epidemiological implications such as including/excluding isolates of particular clades and the estimation of genetic distances. These findings suggest that the single reference approach might introduce systematic errors during mapping that affect subsequent analyses, particularly for data sets with isolates from genetically diverse backgrounds. In any case, exploring the effects of different references on the final conclusions is highly recommended.

Author summaryMapping consists in the alignment of reads (i.e., DNA fragments) obtained through high-throughput genome sequencing to a previously assembled reference sequence. It is a common practice in genomic studies to use a single reference for mapping, usually the  reference genome of a species --a high-quality assembly. However, the selection of an optimal reference is hindered by intrinsic intra-species genetic variability, particularly in bacteria. Biases/errors due to reference choice for mapping in bacteria have been identified. These are mainly originated in alignment errors due to genetic differences between the reference genome and the read sequences. Eventually, they could lead to misidentification of variants and biased reconstruction of phylogenetic trees (which reflect ancestry between different bacterial lineages). However, a systematic work on the effects of reference choice in different bacterial species is still missing, particularly regarding its impact on phylogenies. This work intended to fill that gap. The impact of reference choice has proved to be pervasive in the five bacterial species that we have studied and, in some cases, alterations in phylogenetic trees could lead to incorrect epidemiological inferences. Hence, the use of different reference genomes may be prescriptive to assess the potential biases of mapping.","Valiente-Mullor, C.; Beamud Aranguren, B.; Ansari, I.; Frances-Cuesta, C.; Garcia-Gonzalez, N.; Mejia, L.; Ruiz-Hueso, P.; Gonzalez-Candelas, F.",2020-04-14,Genomics,10.1101/2020.04.14.041004,1,Beatriz  Beamud Aranguren,Universitat de Valencia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041004v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041004v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008678
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,114700,Genomics of experimental diversification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis lung-like conditions,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is among the most problematic opportunistic pathogens for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF), causing repeated and resilient infections in the lung and surrounding airways. Evidence suggests that long-term infections are associated with diversification into specialized types but the underlying cause of that diversification and the effect it has on the persistence of infections remains poorly understood. Here, we use evolve and resequence experiments to investigate the genetic changes accompanying rapid, de novo phenotypic diversification in lab environments designed to mimic two aspects of human lung ecology: spatial structure and complex nutritional content. After [~]220 generations of evolution, we find extensive genetic variation present in all environments, including those that most closely resemble the CF lung, attributable to a combination of high mutation supply rates resulting from large population sizes and the complex ecological conditions imposed by resource complexity and spatial structure. We use the abundance and frequency of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations to estimate the ratio of mutations that are selectively neutral (hitchhikers) to those that are under selection (drivers). A significantly lower proportion of driver mutations in spatially structured populations suggests that reduced dispersal generates subpopulations with reduced effective population size, decreasing the supply of beneficial mutations and causing more divergent evolutionary trajectories. The genes most commonly mutated tend to impact regulatory functions linked to a range of CF-associated phenotypes, including one gene that confers antibiotic resistance despite the absence of antibiotic selection in our experiment, but do not appear to be specific to CF-like conditions arising from antimicrobial treatment, immune system suppression, or competition from other microbial species. Our results are consistent with models of adaptation that see the first mutations fixed during adaptation to a stressful environment being those that are broadly beneficial across a range of environments.","Schick, A.; Kassen, R.",2020-04-15,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2020.04.14.041954,1,Alana  Schick,University of Ottawa,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041954v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.041954v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1093/gbe/evac074
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,115475,Pseudomonas aeruginosa TfpW is a multifunctional D-Araf glycosyltransferase and oligosaccharyltransferase,"TfpW is an oligosaccharyltransferase that modifies the subunits of type IV pili from group IV strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with oligomers of -1,5-linked-D-arabinofuranose (D-Araf). Besides its oligosaccharyltransferase activity, TfpW may be responsible for periplasmic translocation and polymerization of D-Araf. Here we investigated these potential roles of TfpW in Pa5196 pilin glycosylation. Topology studies confirmed the periplasmic location of loop 1 and the large C-terminus domain, however the central portion of TfpW had an indeterminate configuration. Reconstitution of the Pa5196 pilin glycosylation system by providing pilA, tfpW +/- tfpX and the D-Araf biosynthesis genes PsPA7_6246-6249 showed that TfpW is sufficient for glycan polymerization and transfer to pilins in P. aeruginosa PAO1, while TfpX is also necessary in Escherichia coli. In addition to PsPA7_6246, DprE1 (PsPA7_6248) and DprE2 (PsPA7_6249), the GtrA-like component PsPA7_6247 was required for pilin glycosylation in E. coli versus PAO1. In a PAO1 {Delta}arnE/F mutant, loss of PsPA7_6247 expression decreased the level of pilin glycosylation, suggesting that arnE/F may play a role in pilin glycosylation when PsPA7_6247 is absent. Bacterial two-hybrid studies showed interactions of TfpW with itself, TfpX, PsPA7_6247 and DprE2, suggesting the formation of a complex that enables efficient pilin glycosylation. Fluorescence microscopy of E. coli and Pa5196{Delta}dprE1 expressing a DprE1-sGFP fusion showed that the protein is expressed in the cytoplasm, supporting our model that includes cytoplasmic biosynthesis of the lipid carrier-linked D-Araf precursor prior to its periplasmic translocation. Together these data suggest that TfpW may be the first example of a trifunctional flippase, glycosyltransferase, and oligosaccharyltransferase.","Villela, A. D.; Harvey, H.; Graham, K.; Burrows, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,115619,Bacterial defenses against a natural antibiotic promote collateral resilience to clinical antibiotics,"As antibiotic-resistant infections become increasingly prevalent worldwide, understanding the factors that lead to antimicrobial treatment failure is essential to optimizing the use of existing drugs. Opportunistic human pathogens in particular typically exhibit high levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance and tolerance1, leading to chronic infections that can be nearly impossible to eradicate2. We asked whether the recalcitrance of these organisms to antibiotic treatment could be driven in part by their evolutionary history as environmental microbes, which frequently produce or encounter natural antibiotics3,4. Using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model, we demonstrate that the self-produced natural antibiotic pyocyanin (PYO) activates bacterial defenses that confer collateral tolerance to certain synthetic antibiotics, including in a clinically-relevant growth medium. Non-PYO-producing opportunistic pathogens isolated from lung infections similarly display increased antibiotic tolerance when they are co-cultured with PYO-producing P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, we show that beyond promoting bacterial survival in the presence of antibiotics, PYO can increase the apparent rate of mutation to antibiotic resistance by up to two orders of magnitude. Our work thus suggests that bacterial production of natural antibiotics in infections could play an important role in modulating not only the immediate efficacy of clinical antibiotics, but also the rate at which antibiotic resistance arises in multispecies bacterial communities.","Meirelles, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,115599,Conditional antagonism in co-cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans: an intersection of ethanol and phosphate signaling distilled from dual-seq transcriptomics,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are opportunistic pathogens whose interactions involve the secreted products ethanol and phenazines. Here we describe the focal role of ethanol in mixed-species co-cultures by dual RNA-seq analyses. P. aeruginosa and C. albicans transcriptomes were assessed after growth in mono-culture or co-culture with either ethanol-producing C. albicans or a C. albicans mutant lacking the primary ethanol dehydrogenase, Adh1. Analyses using KEGG-pathways and the previously published eADAGE method revealed several P. aeruginosa responses to C. albicans-produced ethanol including the induction of a non-canonical low phosphate response mediated by PhoB. C. albicans wild-type, but not C. albicans adh1{Delta}/{Delta}, induces P. aeruginosa production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (5-MPCA), which forms a red derivative within fungal cells. We first demonstrate that PhoB is required for this interaction and that PhoB hyperactivity, via deletion of pstB, leads to increased production of 5-MPCA even when phosphate concentrations are high, but only in the presence of ethanol. Second, we show that ethanol is only sufficient to promote 5-MPCA production at permissive phosphate concentrations. The intersection of ethanol and phosphate in co-culture is mirrored in C. albicans; the adh1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant had increased expression of genes regulated by Pho4, the C. albicans transcription factor that responds to low phosphate which we confirmed by showing the adh1{Delta}/{Delta} strain had elevated Pho4-dependent phosphatase activity. The dual-dependence on ethanol and phosphate concentrations for anti-fungal production highlights how environmental factors modulate microbial interactions and dictate antagonisms such as those between P. aeruginosa and C. albicans.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans are opportunistic pathogens that are frequently isolated from co-infections. Using a Dual-Seq approach in combination with genetics approaches, we found that ethanol produced by C. albicans stimulates the PhoB regulon in P. aeruginosa asynchronously with activation of the Pho4 regulon in C. albicans. In doing so, we demonstrate that eADAGE-based analysis can improve the understanding of the P. aeruginosa response to ethanol-producing C. albicans as measured by transcriptomics: we identify a subset of PhoB-regulated genes as differentially expressed in response to ethanol. We validate our result by showing that PhoB is necessary for multiple roles in co-culture including the competition for phosphate and the production of 5-methyl-phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, and that the P. aeruginosa response to C. albicans-produced ethanol depends on phosphate availability. The conditional stimulation of virulence production in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ethanol only under phosphate limitation highlights the importance of considering nutrient concentrations in the analysis of co-culture interactions.","Doing, G.; Koeppen, K.; Occhipinti, P.; Hogan, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,115596,Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms display carbohydrate ligands for CD206 and CD209 that interfere with their receptor function,"Bacterial biofilms represent a challenge to the healthcare system because of their resilience against antimicrobials and immune attack. Biofilms consist of bacterial aggregates embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) composed of carbohydrate polymers, nucleic acids and proteins. Carbohydrates within P. aeruginosa biofilms include neutral and mannose-rich Psl, and cationic Pel composed of N-acetyl-galactosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine. Here we show that P. aeruginosa biofilms display ligands for the C-type lectin receptors mannose receptor (MR, CD206) and Dendritic Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin (DC-SIGN, CD209). Binding of MR and DC-SIGN to P. aeruginosa biofilms is carbohydrate-and calcium-dependent and extends to biofilms formed by clinical isolates. Confocal analysis of P. aeruginosa biofilms shows abundant DC-SIGN ligands among bacteria aggregates while MR ligands concentrate into discrete clusters. DC-SIGN ligands are also detected in planktonic P. aeruginosa cultures and depend on the presence of the common polysaccharide antigen. Carbohydrates purified from P. aeruginosa biofilms are recognised by DC-SIGN and MR; both receptors preferentially bind the high molecular weight fraction (HMW; >132,000Da) with KDs in the nM range. HMW preparations contain 74.9-80.9% mannose, display -mannan segments and alter the morphology of human dendritic cells without causing obvious changes in cytokine responses. Finally, HMW interferes with the endocytic activity of cell-associated MR and DC-SIGN. This work identifies MR and DC-SIGN as receptors for bacterial biofilms and highlights the potential for biofilm-associated carbohydrates as immunomodulators through engagement of C-type lectin receptors.

Author SummarySelective engagement of pattern recognition receptors during infection guides the decision-making process during induction of immune responses. This work identifies mannose-rich carbohydrates within bacterial biofilms as novel molecular patterns associated with bacterial infections. P. aeruginosa biofilms and biofilm-derived carbohydrates bind two important lectin receptors, MR (CD206) and DC-SIGN (CD209), involved in recognition of self and immune evasion. Abundance of MR and DC-SIGN ligands in the context of P. aeruginosa biofilms could impact immune responses and promote chronic infection.","Singh, S.; Almuhanna, Y.; Alshahrani, M.; Lowman, D.; Rice, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,115884,"Strain background, species frequency and environmental conditions are important in determining population dynamics and species co-existence between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus","Bacterial communities in the environment and in infections are typically diverse, yet we know little about the factors that determine interspecies interactions. Here, we apply concepts from ecological theory to understand how biotic and abiotic factors affect interaction patterns between the two opportunistic human pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, which often co-occur in polymicrobial infections. Specifically, we conducted a series of short- and long-term competition experiments between P. aeruginosa PAO1 (as our reference strain) and three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, JE2) at three starting frequencies and under three environmental (culturing) conditions. We found that the competitive ability of P. aeruginosa strongly depended on the strain background of S. aureus, whereby P. aeruginosa dominated against Cowan I and 6850, but not against JE2. In the latter case, both species could end up as winners depending on conditions. Specifically, we observed strong frequency-dependent fitness patterns, including positive frequency dependence, where P. aeruginosa could dominate JE2 only when common, but not when rare. Finally, changes in environmental (culturing) conditions fundamentally altered the competitive balance between the two species, in a way that P. aeruginosa dominance increased when moving from shaken to static environments. Altogether, our results highlight that ecological details can have profound effects on the competitive dynamics between co-infecting pathogens, and determine whether two species can co-exist or invade each others populations from rare. Moreover, our findings might parallel certain dynamics observed in chronic polymicrobial infections.

ImportanceBacterial infections are frequently caused by more than one species and such polymicrobial infections are often considered more virulent and more difficult to treat than the respective monospecies infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus are among the most important pathogens in polymicrobial infections and their co-occurrence is linked to worse disease outcome. There is great interest in understanding how these two species interact with each other and what the consequences for the host are. While previous studies have mainly looked at molecular mechanisms implicated in interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, here we show that ecological factors such as strain background, species frequency and environmental conditions are important elements determining population dynamics and species co-existence patterns. We propose that the uncovered principles may also play major roles in infections, and therefore proclaim that an integrative approach combining molecular and ecological aspects is required to fully understand polymicrobial infections.","Niggli, S.; Kümmerli, R.",2020-07-02,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.04.21.052670,2,Selina  Niggli,"Department of Quantitative Biomedicine, University of Zurich, Switzerland",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.052670v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.21.052670v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/AEM.00962-20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,116063,Thiocillin and Micrococcin Exploit the Ferrioxamine Receptor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa for Uptake,"Thiopeptides are a class of Gram-positive antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. They have been underutilized as therapeutics due to solubility issues, poor bioavailability, and lack of activity against Gram-negative pathogens. We discovered recently that a member of this family, thiostrepton, has activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii under iron-limiting conditions. Thiostrepton uses pyoverdine siderophore receptors to cross the outer membrane, and combining thiostrepton with an iron chelator yielded remarkable synergy, significantly reducing the minimal inhibitory concentration. These results led to the hypothesis that other thiopeptides could also inhibit growth by using siderophore receptors to gain access to the cell. Here, we screened six thiopeptides for synergy with the iron chelator deferasirox against P. aeruginosa and a mutant lacking the pyoverdine receptors FpvA and FpvB. Our findings suggest that thiopeptides such as thiocillin cross the outer membrane using FoxA, the ferrioxamine siderophore receptor.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,116583,Pangenome analytics reveal two-component systems as conserved targets in ESKAPEE pathogens,"Bacteria sense and respond to environmental stimuli through two-component systems (TCSs), that are composed of histidine kinase sensing and response regulator elements. TCSs are ubiquitous and participate in numerous cellular functions. TCSs across the ESKAPEE pathogens, representing the leading causes of nosocomial infections, were characterized using pangenome analytics, including annotation, mapping, pangenomic status, gene orientation, sequence variation, and structure. Our findings fall into two categories. 1) phylogenetic distribution of TCSs: (i) the number and types of TCSs varies between species of the ESKAPEE pathogens; (ii) TCSs are group-specific, i.e., Gram-positive and Gram-negative, except for KdpDE; (iii) most TCSs are conserved among genomes of an ESKAPEE, except in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2) sequence variation: (i) at the operon level, the genomic architecture of a TCS operon stratifies into a few discrete classes; and (ii) at the gene sequence level, histidine kinases, responsible for signal sensing, show sequence and structural variability as compared to response regulators that show a high degree of conservation. Taken together, this first comprehensive pangenomic assessment of TCSs reveals a range of strategies deployed by the ESKAPEE pathogens to manifest pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. It further suggests that the conserved features of TCSs makes them an attractive group of potential targets with which to address antibiotic resistance.","Rajput, A.; Seif, Y.; Choudhary, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,116754,Contributions of the Heme Coordinating Ligands of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Outer Membrane Receptor HasR to Extracellular Heme Sensing and Transport,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibits a high requirement for iron which it can acquire via several mechanisms including the acquisition and utilization of heme. P. aeruginosa encodes two heme uptake systems, the heme assimilation system (Has) and the Pseudomonas heme utilization (Phu) system. Extracellular heme is sensed via the Has system that encodes an extra cytoplasmic function (ECF) {sigma} factor system. Previous studies have shown release of heme from the extracellular hemophore HasAp to the outer membrane receptor HasR is required for activation of the {sigma} factor HasI. Herein, employing site-directed mutagenesis, allelic exchange, quantitative PCR analyses, immunoblotting and 13C-heme uptake studies, we characterize the differential contributions of the outer membrane receptor HasR extracellular FRAP/PNPNL loop residue His-624 and the N-terminal plug residue His-221 to heme transport and signaling, respectively. Specifically, we show mutation of the N-terminal plug His-221 disrupts both signaling and transport. The data is consistent with a model where heme release from HasAp to the N-terminal plug of HasR is required to initiate signaling, whereas His624 is required for simultaneously closing off the heme transport channel from the extracellular medium and triggering heme transport. Furthermore, mutation of His-221 leads to dysregulation of both the Has and Phu uptake systems suggesting a possible functional link that is coordinated through the ECF {sigma} factor system.","Dent, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,116773,Remodeling of Chemotaxis is a Cornerstone of Bacterial Swarming,"Many bacteria use flagella-driven motility to swarm or move collectively over a surface terrain. Bacterial adaptations for swarming can include cell elongation, hyper-flagellation, recruitment of special stator proteins and surfactant secretion, among others. We recently demonstrated another swarming adaptation in Escherichia coli, wherein the chemotaxis pathway is remodeled to increase run durations (decrease tumble bias), with running speeds increased as well. We show here that the modification of motility parameters during swarming is not unique to E. coli, but shared by a diverse group of bacteria we examined - Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - suggesting that altering the chemosensory physiology is a cornerstone of swarming.

ImportanceBacteria within a swarm move characteristically in packs, displaying an intricate swirling motion where hundreds of dynamic packs continuously form and dissociate as the swarm colonizes increasing expanse of territory. The demonstrated property of E. coli to reduce its tumble bias and hence increase its run duration during swarming is expected to maintain/promote side-by-side alignment and cohesion within the bacterial packs. Here we observe a similar low tumble bias in five different bacterial species, both Gram positive and Gram negative, each inhabiting a unique habitat and posing unique problems to our health. The unanimous display of an altered run-tumble bias in swarms of all species examined here suggests that this behavioral adaptation is crucial for swarming.","Partridge, J. D.; Nguyen, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,117217,Intra-species signaling between distinct Pseudomonas aeruginosa genotypes increases production of quorum sensing controlled virulence factors,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa damages hosts through the production of diverse secreted products, many of which are regulated by quorum sensing. The lasR gene, which encodes a central quorum-sensing regulator, is frequently mutated, and loss of LasR function impairs the activity of downstream regulators RhlR and PqsR. We found that in diverse models, the presence of P. aeruginosa wild type causes LasR loss-of-function strains to hyperproduce RhlR/I-regulated antagonistic factors, and autoinducer production by the wild type is not required for this effect. We uncovered a reciprocal interaction between isogenic wild type and lasR mutant pairs wherein the iron-scavenging siderophore pyochelin, specifically produced by the lasR mutant, induces citrate release and cross-feeding from wild type. Citrate stimulates RhlR signaling and RhlI levels in LasR-but not in LasR+ strains, and the interactions occur in diverse media. Co-culture interactions between strains that differ by the function of a single transcription factor may explain worse outcomes associated with mixtures of LasR+ and LasR loss-of-function strains. More broadly, this report illustrates how interactions within a genotypically diverse population, similar to those that frequently develop in natural settings, can promote net virulence factor production.","Mould, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,117463,Structural and functional analysis of pyocin S8 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa : requirement of a glutamate in the H-N-H motif for the DNase activity.,"Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a serious threat to global public health, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent necessity. Pyocins are protein antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to kill closely related cells during intraspecific competition. Here, we report an in depth biochemical, microbicidal and structural characterization of a new S-type pyocin, named S8. Initially, we described the domain organization and secondary structure of S8. Subsequently, we observed that a recombinant S8 composed of the killing subunit in complex with the immunity (Im) protein killed the strain PAO1. Furthermore, mutation of a highly conserved glutamic acid to alanine (Glu100Ala) completely inhibited this antimicrobial activity. Probably the integrity of the H-N-H motif is essential in the killing activity of S8, as Glu100 is a highly conserved component of this structure. Next, we observed that S8 is a metal-dependent endonuclease, as EDTA treatment abolished its ability to cleave supercoiled pUC18 plasmid. Supplementation of apo S8 with Ni2+ strongly induced this DNase activity, whereas Mn2+ and Mg2+ exhibited moderate effects and Zn2+ was inhibitory. Additionally, S8 bound Zn2+ with a higher affinity than Ni2+ and the Glu100Ala mutation decreased the affinity of S8 for these metals as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Finally, we describe the crystal structure of the Glu100Ala pyocin-S8DNase-Im complex at 1.38 [A], which gave us new insights into the endonuclease activity of S8. Our results reinforce the possible use of S8 as an alternative antibiotic for MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, while leaving commensal human microbiota intact.","Turano, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,117216,"Suspended multiwalled, acid-functionalized carbon nanotubes promote aggregation of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa","The increasing prevalence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as components of new functional materials has the unintended consequence of causing increases in CNT concentrations in aqueous environments. Aqueous systems are reservoirs for bacteria, including human and animal pathogens, that can form biofilms. At high concentrations, CNTs have been shown to display biocidal effects; however, at low concentrations, the interaction between CNTs and bacteria is more complicated, and antimicrobial action is highly dependent upon the properties of the CNTs in suspension. Here, impact of low concentrations of multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) on the biofilm-forming opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is studied. Using phase contrast and confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and antibiotic tolerance assays, it is found that sub-lethal concentrations (2 mg/L) of MWCNTs promote aggregation of P. aeruginosa into multicellular clusters. However, the antibiotic tolerance of these ""young"" bacterial-CNT aggregates is similar to that of CNT-free cultures. Overall, our results indicate that the co-occurrence of MWCNTs and P. aeruginosa in aqueous systems, which promotes the increased number and size of bacterial aggregates, could increase the dose to which humans or animals are exposed.","Kovach, K.; Venu, I.; Patel, P.; Kirisits, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,117538,"A novel DNA binding mode, conformational change and intramolecular signaling in MutS upon mismatch recognition in replication DNA structures","MutS initiates mismatch repair by recognizing mismatches in newly replicated DNA. Specific interactions between MutS and mismatches within double-stranded DNA promote ADP-ATP exchange and a conformational change into a sliding clamp. Here, we demonstrated that MutS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa associates with primed DNA replication substrates. The predicted structure of this MutS-DNA complex revealed a new DNA binding site, in which Asn 279 and Arg 272 appeared to directly interact with the 3-OH terminus of primed DNA. Mutation of these residues resulted in a noticeable defect in the interaction of MutS with replication DNA substrates. Remarkably, MutS interaction with a mismatch within primed DNA induced a compaction of the protein structure and impaired the formation of an ATP-bound sliding clamp.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,118153,"Abasy Atlas v2.2: The most comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of meta-curated, historical, bacterial regulatory networks, their completeness and system-level characterization","Some organism-specific databases about regulation in bacteria have become larger, accelerated by high-throughput methodologies, while others are no longer updated or accessible. Each database homogenize its datasets, giving rise to heterogeneity across databases. Such heterogeneity mainly encompasses different names for a gene and different network representations, generating duplicated interactions that could bias network analyses. Abasy (Across-bacteria systems) Atlas consolidates information from different sources into meta-curated regulatory networks in bacteria. The high-quality networks in Abasy Atlas enable cross-organisms analyses, such as benchmarking studies where gold standards are required. Nevertheless, network incompleteness still casts doubts on the conclusions of network analyses, and available sampling methods cannot reflect the curation process. To tackle this problem, the updated version of Abasy Atlas presented in this work provides historical snapshots of regulatory networks. Thus, network analyses can be performed at different completeness levels, making possible to identify potential bias and to predict future results. We leverage the recently found constraint in the complexity of regulatory networks to develop a novel model to quantify the total number of regulatory interactions as a function of the genome size. This completeness estimation is a valuable insight that may aid in the daunting task of network curation, prediction, and validation. The new version of Abasy Atlas provides 76 networks (204,282 regulatory interactions) covering 42 bacteria (64% Gram-positive and 36% Gram-negative) distributed in 9 species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptomyces coelicolor), containing 8,459 regulons and 4,335 modules.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,118257,A first perturbome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Identification of core genes related to multiple perturbations by a machine learning approach,"Tolerance to stress conditions is vital for organismal survival, including bacteria under specific environmental conditions, antibiotics, and other perturbations. Some studies have described common modulation and shared genes during stress response to different types of disturbances (termed as perturbome), leading to the idea of central control at the molecular level. We implemented a robust machine learning approach to identify and describe genes associated with multiple perturbations or perturbome in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 model.

Using microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), we evaluated six approaches to rank and select genes: using two methodologies, data single partition (SP method) or multiple partitions (MP method) for training and testing datasets, we evaluated three classification algorithms (SVM Support Vector Machine, KNN K-Nearest neighbor and RF Random Forest). Gene expression patterns and topological features at the systems level were included to describe the perturbome elements.

We were able to select and describe 46 core response genes associated with multiple perturbations in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and it can be considered a first report of the P. aeruginosa perturbome. Molecular annotations, patterns in expression levels, and topological features in molecular networks revealed biological functions of biosynthesis, binding, and metabolism, many of them related to DNA damage repair and aerobic respiration in the context of tolerance to stress. We also discuss different issues related to implemented and assessed algorithms, including data partitioning, classification approaches, and metrics. Altogether, this work offers a different and robust framework to select genes using a machine learning approach.","Molina-Mora, J. A.; Montero-Manso, P.; Batan, R. G.; Sanchez, R. C.; Fernandez, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,118352,Towards 'Ancientbiotics' for Biofilms: How can we bring traditional medicinal remedies out of treatise and into contemporary science?,"IntroductionTraditional medicinal remedies hold vast potential as novel antimicrobial agents, particularly for recalcitrant infection states such as biofilms. To explore their potential, it is important to bring these remedies out of ancient treatise and into present-day scientific evaluation. For traditional medical practices, this  development pipeline starts with probing treatise for potential remedies and testing them for anti-biofilm effects, or the  treatise to test phase.

AimThe aim of this work is to present a primer for developing  ancientbiotics against biofilms, that focuses on the  treatise to test phase of the pipeline. Based on our approach and results, we provide insights into the considerations and challenges relevant to evaluating traditional remedies as anti-biofilm agents.

MethodologyWe identified and reconstituted plant-based medicinal formulations from historical treatises of Indian traditional medicine, and analyzed their efficacy using widely-employed microtiter based assays, that constitute the cornerstone of biofilm studies. Measuring biomass and metabolic activity, we evaluated effects on biofilm formation and eradication of pre-formed biofilms, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

ResultsBased on recipes and preparation practices across several texts, and with modifications to ensure compatibility with modern scientific practices, three plant-based traditional remedies were identified and formulated in sesame oil (Bryophyllum pinnatum, Cynodon dactylon, and Ocimum tenuiflorum). We observed differential effects on biomass and metabolic activity on the biofilm formation and eradication of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus; highlighting the value of the microtiter-based assays as an initial screening tool for traditional remedies.

ConclusionThrough this study, we provide insights into considerations relevant to the  treatise to test phase of the  ancientbiotics pipeline, such as identifying ancient remedies, reconstituting them with present-day modifications, and using in vitro assay formats for evaluation. The learnings in this primer will be relevant to both contemporary scientists and practitioners of ancient medicine, and will serve as a starting point for future studies exploring anti-biofilm approaches at the interface of historical and modern medicine.","Madhusoodhanan, V.; Kadam, S.; Bandgar, A.; Kaushik, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,118778,The loss of the pyoverdine secondary receptor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa results in a fitter strain suitable for population invasion,"The rapid emergence of antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens constitutes a critical problem in healthcare and requires the development of novel treatments. Potential strategies include the exploitation of microbial social interactions based on public goods, which are produced at a fitness cost by cooperative microorganisms, but can be exploited by cheaters that do not produce these goods. Cheater invasion has been proposed as a  Trojan horse approach to infiltrate pathogen populations with strains deploying built-in weaknesses (e.g. sensitiveness to antibiotics). However, previous attempts have been often unsuccessful because population invasion by cheaters was prevented by various mechanisms including the presence of spatial structure (e.g. growth in biofilms), which limits the diffusion and exploitation of public goods. Here we followed an alternative approach and examined whether the manipulation of public good uptake and not its production could result in potential  Trojan horses suitable for population invasion. We focused on the siderophore pyoverdine produced by the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPAO1 and manipulated its uptake by deleting and/or overexpressing the pyoverdine primary (FpvA) and secondary (FpvB) receptors. We found that receptor synthesis feeds back on pyoverdine production and uptake rates, which led to strains with altered pyoverdine-associated costs and benefits. Moreover, we found that the receptor FpvB was advantageous under iron-limited conditions but revealed hidden costs in the presence of an antibiotic stressor (gentamicin). As a consequence, FpvB mutants became the fittest strain under gentamicin exposure, displacing the wildtype in liquid cultures, and in biofilms and during infections of the wax moth larvae Galleria mellonella, which both represent structured environments. Our findings reveal that an evolutionary trade-off associated with the costs and benefits of a versatile pyoverdine uptake strategy can be harnessed for devising a Trojan horse candidate for medical interventions.","Gonzalez, J.; Salvador, M.; Ozkayab, O.; Spick, M.; Costa, C.; Bailey, M.

This study determined the relative activity of the L-and D-enantiomers of GL13K to wild-type and drug-resistant strains of three gram-negative species and against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. DGL13K displayed in vitro activity against ESBL and KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (MICs 16-32 g/ml), MDR and XDR P. aeruginosa, and XDR Acinetobacter baumannii carrying metallo-beta-lactamases (MICs 8-32 g/ml). P. aeruginosa showed low inherent resistance to DGL13K and the increased metabolic activity and growth caused by sub-MIC concentrations of GL13K peptides did not result in acquired bacterial resistance. Daily dosing for approximately two weeks did not increase the MIC of DGL13K or cause cross-resistance between LGL13K and DGL13K. These data suggest that DGL13K is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further development.","Gorr, S.-U.; Brigman, H. V.; Anderson, J. C.; Hirsch, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,119428,Involvement of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa MexAB-OprM efflux pump in the secretion of the metallophore pseudopaline,"The ability for all organisms to acquire metals from their environment is essential for life. To overcome the metal restriction imposed by the hosts nutritional immunity, bacterial pathogens exploits the use of small high metal affinity molecules called metallophores. Metallophores are first synthetized in the cytoplasm, then secreted into the medium where they sequester the metal. The metal-metallophore complex is then imported into the bacterium following binding to dedicated cell surface receptors. Recently, a new family of metallophores has been discovered in pathogenic bacteria called staphylopine in Staphylococcus aureus and pseudopaline in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we are expending the molecular understanding of pseudopaline secretion/recovery cycle across the double-membraned envelope of the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We first revealed that pseudopaline is secreted in a two-step process including export across the inner membrane by the CntI exporter followed by a specific transport across the outer membrane by the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. Such involvement of MexAB-OprM in pseudopaline secretion, reveal a new natural function that extends its spectrum of functions and therefore reasserts its interest as antibacterial target. We then addressed the fate of the recovered metal-loaded pseudopaline by combining in vitro reconstitution experiments using radio-labeled pseudopaline subjected to bacterial lysates, and in vivo phenotyping in absence of pseudopaline transporters. Our data support the existence of a pseudopaline degradation/modification mechanism, possibly involved in metal release following pseudopaline recovery. All together our data allowed us to provide an improved molecular model of secretion, recovery and fate of this important metallophore by P. aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEPseudopaline is a broad spectrum metallophore produced and used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to supply the bacterium in metal in metal scarce environments. Here we are investigating the pseudopaline transport/recovery cycle across the bacterial envelope. We are first demonstrating that pseudopaline secretion in the medium is achieved by a specific efflux pump, usually dedicated to the release of toxic compounds such as antibiotics, thus revealing a new natural function for this efflux pump reasserting its interest as antibacterial target. Additional experiments also revealing the existence of an intracellular pseudopaline degradation mechanism providing new clues to another obscure step of the pseudopaline cycle which is the intracellular metal liberation from the imported metal-pseudopaline complex. All together our data allowed us to disclose important aspects of the secretion, recovery and fate of this essential molecule used by P. aeruginosa to survive during infections thus constituting new potential targets for antibacterial development.","Gomez, N.

The aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19, deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We studied the carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory responses, and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota. Exploring solid-phase immunoassays, we evaluated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins (C-type lectins and Siglecs) involved in binding, triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses. We revealed a specific binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the receptors DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 that are all expressed on myeloid immune cells. In addition, because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate viral infection, we studied the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides, as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates. We show specific binding of the spike protein to different S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 19F and 23F but not to serotype 14). Moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia. Interestingly, we identified rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. In conclusion, we revealed novel ACE2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells, as well as host lung microbiota glyco-conjugates. Our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling, that may contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation. Moreover we identified specific rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2, providing a hypothetical link between the presence of specific lung microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.","Chiodo, F.; Bruijns, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,119772,The two-component system CopRS maintains femtomolar levels of free copper in the periplasm of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a phosphatase-based mechanism,"Two component systems control periplasmic Cu+ homeostasis in Gram-negative bacteria. In characterized systems such as Escherichia coli CusRS, upon Cu+ binding to the periplasmic sensing domain of CusS, a cytoplasmic phosphotransfer domain phosphorylates the response regulator CusR. This drives the expression of efflux transporters, chaperones, and redox enzymes to ameliorate metal toxic effects. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa two component sensor histidine kinase CopS exhibits a Cu-dependent phosphatase activity that maintains a non-phosphorylated CopR when the periplasmic Cu levels are below its activation threshold. Upon Cu+ binding to the sensor, the phosphatase activity is blocked and the phosphorylated CopR activates transcription of the CopRS regulon. Supporting the model, mutagenesis experiments revealed that the {Delta}copS strain showed constitutive high expression of the CopRS regulon, lower intracellular Cu+ levels, and larger Cu tolerance when compared to wild type cells. The invariant phospho-acceptor residue His235 of CopS was not required for the phosphatase activity itself, but necessary for its Cu-dependency. To sense the metal, the periplasmic domain of CopS binds two Cu+ ions at its dimeric interface. Homology modeling of CopS based on CusS structure (four Ag+ binding sites) clearly explains the different binding stoichiometries in both systems. Interestingly, CopS binds Cu+/2+ with 30 x 10-15 M affinities, pointing to the absence of free (hydrated) Cu+/2+ in the periplasm.

IMPORTANCECopper is a micronutrient required as cofactor in redox enzymes. When free, copper is toxic, mismetallating proteins, and generating damaging free radicals. Consequently, copper overload is a strategy that eukaryotic cells use to combat pathogens. Bacteria have developed copper sensing transcription factors to control copper homeostasis. The cell envelope is the first compartment that has to cope with copper stress. Dedicated two component systems control the periplasmic response to metal overload. This manuscript shows that the copper sensing two component system present in Pseudomonadales exhibits a signal-dependent phosphatase activity controlling the activation of the response regulator, distinct from previously described periplasmic Cu sensors. Importantly, the data show that the sensor is activated by copper levels compatible with the absence of free copper in the cell periplasm. This emphasizes the diversity of molecular mechanisms that have evolved in various bacteria to manage the copper cellular distribution.","Novoa-Aponte, L.; Soncini, F.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120242,Comparative genomics of ocular Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from keratitis patients with different clinical outcomes,"Bacterial keratitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a destructive disease of cornea. Pseudomonas keratitis progresses rapidly and leads to vision loss if untreated. Even with adequate treatment, many patients show poor visual outcomes. The virulence factors or multiple drug-resistant (MDR) mechanisms of the ocular strains responsible for poor clinical outcomes remain largely unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of five P. aeruginosa strains cultured from corneal scrapings of the healed and corneal buttons of the poor outcome keratitis patients. We investigated the distribution of virulence factors, resistance genes and resistance-associated mutations, the efflux-pump system in all five genomes, and as groups between poor and good clinical outcome as well as MDR vs. non-MDR. We detected several resistance genes and mutations associated with drug resistance in MDR groups; however, a large number of virulence genes were detected in all our genomes. Among the virulence genes, exoU and exoS exotoxin of the Type III secretion system detected in MDR and non-MDR strains, respectively, considered as main virulence contributors of keratitis pathogenesis. Despite this fact, this study did not show an association between MDR with exoU and poor clinical outcomes. However, strain-specific resistance and virulence genes were observed in this study, suggesting their role in the clinical outcome. Mainly, the flagellar genes fliC and fliD, reported to altering the host immune response, might impact the clinical outcome. This comparative study may provide new insights into the genome of ocular strains and requires further functional studies.","Kandasamy, K.; Thirumalmuthu, K.; Venkatesh Prajna, N.; Prajna, L.; Mohankumar, V.; Devarajan, B.",2020-05-16,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.05.15.097220,1,Bharanidharan  Devarajan,"Aravind Medical Research Foundation, Madurai - 625020, India.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097220v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.097220v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.ygeno.2020.08.032
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120024,Cephalosporins target quorum sensing and suppress virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Caenorhabditis elegans infection model,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes a chemical social networking system referred to as quorum sensing (QS) to strategically co-ordinate the expression of virulence factors and biofilm formation. Virulence attributes damage the host cells, impair the host immune system, and protect bacterial cells from antibiotic attack. Thus, anti-QS agents may act as novel anti-infective therapeutics to treat P. aeruginosa infections. The present study was performed to evaluate the anti-QS, anti-biofilm, and anti-virulence activity of {beta}-lactam antibiotics (carbapenems and cephalosporins) against P. aeruginosa. The anti-QS activity was quantified using Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 as a QS reporter strain. Our results showed that cephalosporins including cefepime (CP), ceftazidime (CF), and ceftriaxone (CT) exhibited potent anti-QS and anti-virulence activities against P. aeruginosa PAO1. These antibiotics significantly impaired motility phenotypes, decreased pyocyanin production, and reduced the biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa PAO1. In the present study, we studied isogenic QS mutants of PAO1: {Delta}LasR, {Delta}RhlR, {Delta}PqsA, and {Delta}PqsR and found that the levels of virulence factors of antibiotic-treated PAO1 were comparable to QS mutant strains. Molecular docking predicted high binding affinities of cephalosporins for the ligand-binding pocket of QS receptors (CviR, LasR, and PqsR). In addition, our results showed that the anti-microbial activity of aminoglycosides increased in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of CP against P. aeruginosa PAO1. Further, utilizing Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model for the in vivo anti-virulence effects of antibiotics, cephalosporins showed a significant increase in C. elegans survival by suppressing virulence factor production in P. aeruginosa. Thus, our results indicate that cephalosporins might provide a viable anti-virulence therapy in the treatment of infections caused by multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa.","Kumar, L.; Brenner, N.; Brice, J.; Klein-Seetharaman, J.; Sarkar, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120801,Acquired fluoroquinolone resistance genes in corneal isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Fluroquinolones are widely used as an empirical therapy for pseudomonal ocular infections. Based on increasing reports on acquired fluroquinolone resistance genes in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we investigated 33 strains of P. aeruginosa isolated from the cornea of microbial keratitis patients in India and Australia between 1992 and 2018 to understand the prevalence of acquired fluroquinolone resistance genes in ocular isolates and to assess whether the possession of those genes was associated with fluoroquinolone susceptibility. We obtained the whole genome sequence of 33 isolates using Illumina MiSeq platform and investigated the prevalence of two fluoroquinolone resistance genes crpP and qnrVC1. To examine the associated mobile genetic elements of qnrVC1 positive strains, we obtained long read sequences using Oxford Nanopore MinION and performed hybrid assembly to combine long reads with Illumina short sequence reads. We further assessed mutations in QRDRs and antibiotic susceptibilities to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin to examine the association between resistance genes and phenotype. Twenty strains possessed crpP in genetic islands characterised by possession of integrative conjugative elements. The qnrVC1 gene was carried by four isolates on class I integrons and Tn3 transposons along with aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance genes. We did not observe any evidence of plasmids carrying fluroquinolone resistance genes. Resistance to fluroquinolones was observed in those strains which possessed crpP, qnrVC1 and that had QRDRs mutations. The presence of crpP was not a sole cause of fluroquinolone resistance.","Khan, M.; Summers, S.; Rice, S. A.; Stapleton, F.; Willcox, M. D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120440,Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction,"Surface topography guides cell behavior and is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. The large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed micro-topographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to the boundary conditions of the design algorithm and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, we assessed to what extend we could expand the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses using natural surfaces. To this end, we replicated twenty-six plant and insect surfaces in polystyrene and quantified their surface properties using white light interferometry, image analysis and principle component analysis. Next, we quantified mesenchymal stem cell morphology and the pattern of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and compared it to previous data from TopoChip screens. Our data show that natural surfaces extended the TopoChip design space. Moreover, the natural surfaces induced MSC morphologies and bacterial attachment patterns not previously observed on the TopoChip. In the future, we will train our design algorithms with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to further explore the design space and bio-active properties of surface topography.","De Boer, J.; Vermeulen, S.; Honig, F.; Vasilevich, A.; Roumans, N.; Carlier, A.; Romero, M.; Williams, P.; Uquillas, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120546,Role of Inflammasome-independent Activation of IL-1β by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Protease LasB,"Pulmonary damage by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis lung infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia is mediated both by pathogen virulence factors and host inflammation. Impaired immune function due to tissue damage and inflammation, coupled with pathogen multidrug resistance, complicates management of these deep-seated infections. Therefore, preservation of lung function and effective immune clearance may be enhanced by selectively controlling inflammation. Pathological inflammation during P. aeruginosa pneumonia is driven by interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). This proinflammatory cytokine is canonically regulated by caspase-family inflammasome proteases, but we report that plasticity in IL-1{beta} proteolytic activation allows for its direct maturation by the pseudomonal protease LasB. LasB promotes IL-1{beta} activation, neutrophilic inflammation, and destruction of lung architecture characteristic of severe P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Discovery of this IL-1{beta} regulatory mechanism provides a distinct target for anti-inflammatory therapeutics, such that matrix metalloprotease inhibitors blocking LasB limit inflammation and pathology during P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections.

Research in ContextInflammation is highly damaging during lung infections by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sun et al. demonstrate that the Pseudomonas LasB protease directly activates IL-1{beta} in an inflammasome-independent manner. Inhibition of IL-1{beta} conversion by LasB protects against neutrophilic inflammation and destruction of the lung. Adjunctive therapeutics that limit pathological inflammation induced by infection would be beneficial for the treatment of pulmonary infections when used with conventional antibiotics.","Sun, J.; Larock, D.; Skowronski, E.; Kimmey, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,120543,Distinct activities of bacterial condensins for chromosome management in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"Bacteria encompass three types of structurally related SMC complexes referred to as condensins. Smc-ScpAB is present in most bacteria while MukBEF is found in enterobacteria and MksBEF is scattered over the phylogenic tree. The contributions of these condensins to chromosome management were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carries both Smc-ScpAB and MksBEF. In this bacterium, SMC-ScpAB controls chromosome disposition by juxtaposing chromosome arms. In contrast, MksBEF is critical for chromosome segregation in the absence of the main segregation system and affects the higher-order architecture of the chromosome by promoting DNA contacts in the megabase range. Strikingly, our results reveal a prevalence of Smc-ScpAB over MksBEF involving a coordination of their activities with the DNA replication process. They also show that E. coli MukBEF can substitute for MksBEF in P. aeruginosa while prevailing over Smc-ScpAB. Altogether, our results reveal a hierarchy between activities of bacterial condensins on the same chromosome.","Lioy, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,121602,Discovery of positive and purifying selection in metagenomic time series of hypermutator microbial populations,"A general method to infer both positive and purifying selection during the real-time evolution of hypermutator pathogens would be broadly useful. To this end, we introduce a simple test to infer mode of selection (STIMS) from metagenomic time series of evolving microbial populations. We test STIMS on metagenomic data generated by simulations of bacterial evolution, and on metagenomic data spanning 62,750 generations of Lenskis long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE). In both cases, STIMS recovers signals of positive and purifying selection on gold standard sets of genes. Using STIMS, we find strong evidence of ongoing positive selection on key regulators of the E. coli gene regulatory network, even in some hypermutator populations. STIMS also detects positive selection on regulatory genes in hypermutator populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that adapted to subinhibitory concentrations of colistin - an antibiotic of last resort - for just twenty-six days of laboratory evolution. Our results show that the fine-tuning of gene regulatory networks is a general mechanism for rapid and ongoing adaptation. The simplicity of STIMS, together with its intuitive visual interpretation, make it a useful test for positive and purifying selection in metagenomic data sets that track the evolution of hypermutator populations in real-time.","Maddamsetti, R.; Grant, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,121231,The stringent stress response controls proteases and global regulators under optimal growth conditions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The bacterial stringent stress response, mediated by the signaling molecule guanosine tetra-phosphate, ppGpp, has recently gained attention as being important during normal cellular growth and as potential new therapeutic target, which warrants detailed mechanistic understanding. Here, we used intracellular protein tracking in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, which indicated that RelA was bound to the ribosome, while SpoT localized at the cell poles. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the transcriptome of a ppGpp-deficient strain under non-stressful nutrient-rich broth conditions where the mutant grew at the same rate as the parent strain. In exponential growth phase, the lack of ppGpp led to >1,600 transcriptional changes (fold-change cut-off {+/-}1.5), providing further novel insights into the normal physiological role of ppGpp. The stringent response was linked to gene expression of various proteases and secretion systems including aprA, PA0277, impA, and clpP2. The previously observed reduction in cytotoxicity towards red blood cells, in a stringent response mutant, appeared to be due to aprA. Investigation of an aprA mutant in a murine skin infection model, showed increased survival rates of the aprA mutant consistent with previous observations that stringent-response mutants have reduced virulence. In addition, the overexpression of relA, but not induction of ppGpp with serine hydroxamate, dysregulated global transcriptional regulators as well as >30% of the regulatory networks controlled by AlgR, OxyR, LasR, and AmrZ. Together these data expand our knowledge about ppGpp and its regulatory network and role in environmental adaptation. It also confirms its important role throughout the normal growth cycle of bacteria.

Significance StatementMicroorganisms need to adapt rapidly to survive harsh environmental changes. Here, we showed the broad influence of the highly studied bacterial stringent stress response under non-stressful conditions that indicate its general physiological importance and might reflect the readiness of bacteria to respond to and activate acute stress responses. Using RNA-Seq to investigate the transcriptional network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells revealed that >30% of all genes changed expression in a stringent-response mutant under optimal growth conditions. This included genes regulated by global transcriptional regulators and novel downstream effectors. Our results help to understand the importance of this stress regulator in bacterial lifestyle under relatively unstressed conditions. As such it draws attention to the consequences of targeting this ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule.","Pletzer, D.; Blimkie, T. M.; Wolfmeier, H.; Li, Y.; Baghela, A.; Lee, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,121241,"Alternating dynamics of oriC, SMC and MksBEF in segregation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chromosome","Condensins are essential for global chromosome organization in diverse bacteria. Atypically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes condensins from two superfamilies, SMC-ScpAB and MksBEF. We report that the two proteins play specialized roles in chromosome packing and segregation and are synthetically lethal with ParB. Inactivation of SMC or MksB asymmetrically affected global chromosome layout, its timing of segregation and sometimes triggered a chromosomal inversion. Localization pattern was also unique to each protein. SMC clusters colocalized with oriC throughout cell cycle except shortly after origin duplication, whereas MksB clusters emerged at cell quarters shortly prior to oriC duplication and stayed there even after cell division. Relocation of the proteins was abrupt and coordinated with oriC dynamic. These data reveal that the two condensins asymmetrically play dual roles in chromosome maintenance by organizing it and mediating its segregation. Furthermore, the choreography of condensins and oriC relocations suggest an elegant mechanism for the birth and maturation of chromosomes.

ImportanceMechanisms that define the chromosome as a structural entity remain unknown. A key element in this process are condensins, which globally organize chromosomes and contribute to their segregation. This study characterized condensin and chromosome dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which harbors condensins from two major protein superfamilies, SMC and MksBEF. The study revealed that both proteins asymmetrically play a dual role in chromosome maintenance by spatially organizing the chromosomes and guiding their segregation but can substitute for each other in some activities. The timing of chromosome, SMC and MksBEF relocation was highly ordered and interdependent revealing causative relationships in the process. Moreover, MksBEF was found to produce clusters at the site of chromosome replication that survived cell division and remained in place until chromosome replication was complete. Overall, these data delineate the functions of condensins from the SMC MksBEF superfamilies, reveal the existence of a chromosome organizing center and suggest a mechanism that might explain the biogenesis of chromosomes.","Zhao, H.; Bhowmik, B.; Rybenkov, V.",2020-05-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.05.23.112730,1,Valentin  Rybenkov,University of Oklahoma,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112730v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.23.112730v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1128/mSphere.00238-20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,121696,PelX is a UDP-N-acetylglucosamine C4-epimerase involved in Pel polysaccharide-dependent biofilm formation,"Pel is an N-acetylgalactosamine rich polysaccharide that contributes to the structure and function of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. The pelABCDEFG operon is highly conserved among diverse bacterial species, and thus Pel may be a widespread biofilm determinant. Previous annotation of pel gene clusters led us to identify an additional gene, pelX, that is found adjacent to pelABCDEFG in over 100 different bacterial species. The pelX gene is predicted to encode a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily of enzymes, but its potential role in Pel-dependent biofilm formation is unknown. Herein, we have used Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 as a model to understand PelX function as P. aeruginosa lacks a pelX homologue in its pel gene cluster. We find that P. protegens forms Pel-dependent biofilms, however, despite expression of pelX under these conditions, biofilm formation was unaffected in a {Delta}pelX strain. This observation led to our identification of the pelX paralogue, PFL_5533, which we designate pgnE, that appears to be functionally redundant to pelX. In line with this, a {Delta}pelX {Delta}pgnE double mutant was substantially impaired in its ability to form Pel-dependent biofilms. To understand the molecular basis for this observation, we determined the structure of PelX to 2.1[A] resolution. The structure revealed that PelX resembles UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) C4-epimerases and, using 1H NMR analysis, we show that PelX catalyzes the epimerization between UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Pel-dependent biofilm formation requires a UDP-GlcNAc C4-epimerase that generates the UDP-GalNAc precursors required by the Pel synthase machinery for polymer production.","Marmont, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,121909,"Novel antioxidant therapy with the immediate precursor to glutathione, γ-glutamylcysteine (GGC), ameliorates LPS-induced cellular stress in an in vitro cystic fibrosis model","IntroductionGlutathione deficiency and chronic bacterial inflammation exacerbates the oxidative stress damage to airways in cystic fibrosis. Improvements to current antioxidant therapeutic strategies are needed. Dietary supplement, {gamma}-glutamylcysteine (GGC), the immediate precursor to glutathione, rapidly boosts cellular glutathione levels following a single dose in healthy individuals. Efficacy of GGC against Pseudomonas aeruginosa derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prominent factor in mediating both bacterial virulence and host responses, in CF remains unassessed.

MethodsPrimary F508del/F508del mucociliary differentiated bronchial and nasal epithelial cells were created to model LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation of CF. The proteomic signature of GGC treated cells was resolved by qLC-MS/MS. Parameters including cell redox state (glutathione, ROS), anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-8, IDO-1) and cellular health (membrane integrity, stress granule formation and cell viability) were assayed.

ResultsProteomic analysis identified perturbation of several pathways related to cellular respiration and stress responses upon LPS challenge. Most of these were resolved when cells were treated with GGC. While GGC did not resolve LPS-induced IL-8 and IDO-1 activity, it effectively attenuated LPS-induced ROS and stress granule formation, while significantly increasing intracellular glutathione levels and improving epithelial cell barrier integrity. Moreover, we compared the effect of GGC with thiols NAC and glutathione on cell viability. GGC was the only thiol that increased cell viability; protecting cells against LPS induced cell death. Both therapeutic and prophylactic treatments were successful.

ConclusionTogether, these findings indicate that GGC has therapeutic potential for treatment and prevention of oxidative stress related damage to airways in Cystic Fibrosis.","Hewson, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,122059,Burkholderia thailandensis methylated hydroxy-alkylquinolines: biosynthesis and antimicrobial activity in co-culture experiments,"The bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis produces an arsenal of secondary metabolites that have diverse structures and roles in the ecology of this soil-dwelling bacterium. In liquid co-culture experiments, B. thailandensis secretes an antimicrobial that nearly eliminates another soil bacterium, Bacillus subtilis. To identify the antimicrobial, we used a transposon mutagenesis approach. This screen identified antimicrobial-defective mutants with insertions in the hmqA, hmqC and hmqF genes involved in biosynthesis of a family of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones called 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkenylquinolines (HMAQs), which are closely related to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs). Insertions also occurred in the previously uncharacterized gene BTH_II1576. Results confirm that BTH_II1576 is involved in generating N-oxide derivatives of HMAQs (HMAQ-NO) in B. thailandensis and that HMAQ-NOs are sufficient to eliminate B. subtilis in co-cultures. Moreover, synthetic HMAQ-NO is [~]50-fold more active than HMAQ. Both the methyl group and the length of the carbon side chain account for high activity of HMAQ-NO against B. subtilis. The results provide new information on the biosynthesis and activities of HMAQs and reveal new insight into how these molecules might be important for the ecology of B. thailandensis.

IMPORTANCEThe soil bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis produces 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones, mostly methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines, a family of relatively unstudied metabolites similar to molecules also synthesized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Several of the methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines have antimicrobial activity against other species. We show that N-oxidated methyl-alkenylquinolines are particularly antimicrobial and sufficient to kill Bacillus subtilis in co-cultures. We confirmed their biosynthesis requires the previously unstudied protein HmqL. These results provide new information about the biology of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolones, particularly the methylated 4-hydroxy-alkenylquinolines, which are unique to B. thailandensis. This study also has importance for understanding B. thailandensis secondary metabolites and has implications for potential therapeutic development.","Klaus, J. R.; Majerczyk, C.; Moon, S.; Eppler, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,122415,CryoEM map of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilQ enables structural characterization of TsaP,"The type IV pilus machinery is a multi-protein complex that polymerizes and depolymerizes a pilus fibre used for attachment, twitching motility, phage adsorption, natural competence, protein secretion, and surface-sensing. An outer membrane secretin pore is required for passage of the pilus fibre out of the cell. Herein, the structure of the tetradecameric secretin, PilQ, from the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IVa pilus system was determined to 4.3 [A] and 4.4 [A] resolution in the presence and absence of C7 symmetric spokes, respectively. The heptameric spokes were found to be the two tandem C-terminal domains of TsaP. TsaP forms a belt around PilQ and while the protein is not essential for twitching motility, over-expression of TsaP triggers a signal cascade upstream of PilY1 leading to cyclic di-GMP up-regulation. These results resolve the identity of the spokes identified with Proteobacterial PilQ homologs and may reveal a new component of the surface-sensing cyclic di-GMP signal cascade.

IMPACT STATEMENTThe type IV pilus is critical for bacterial virulence. The co-structure of the pilus secretin PilQ and TsaP is determined. Characterization of TsaP implicates it in surface-sensing signal transduction.","Mccallum, M.; Tammam, S.; Rubinstein, J. L.; Burrows, L. L.; Howell, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,122308,The evolution of virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during chronic wound infection,"Opportunistic pathogens are associated with a number of chronic human infections, yet the evolution of virulence in these organisms during chronic infection remains poorly understood. Here, we tested the evolution of virulence in the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a murine chronic wound model using a two-part serial passage and sepsis experiment, and found that virulence evolved in different directions in each line of evolution. We also assessed P. aeruginosa adaptation to a chronic wound after 42 days of evolution, and found that morphological diversity in our evolved populations was limited compared to that previously described in cystic fibrosis (CF) infections. Using whole genome sequencing, we found that genes previously implicated in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis (lasR, pilR, fleQ, rpoN, and pvcA), acquired mutations during the course of evolution in wounds, with some mutations evolving in parallel across all lines of evolution. Our findings highlight that (i) P. aeruginosa heterogeneity may be less extensive in chronic wounds than in CF lungs; (ii) genes involved in P. aeruginosa pathogenesis acquire mutations during chronic wound infection; (iii) similar genetic adaptations are employed by P. aeruginosa across multiple infection environments, and (iv) current models of virulence may not adequately explain the diverging evolutionary trajectories observed in an opportunistic pathogen during chronic wound infection.","Vanderwoude, J.; Fleming, D.; Azimi, S.; Trivedi, U.; Rumbaugh, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,122803,Harnessing Ultrasound-Stimulated Phase Change Contrast Agents to Improve Antibiotic Efficacy Against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Biofilms,"Bacterial biofilms, often associated with chronic infections, respond poorly to antibiotic therapy and frequently require surgical intervention. Biofilms harbor persister cells, metabolically indolent cells, which are tolerant to most conventional antibiotics. In addition, the biofilm matrix can act as a physical barrier, impeding diffusion of antibiotics. Novel therapeutic approaches frequently improve biofilm killing, but usually fail to achieve eradication. Failure to eradicate the biofilm leads to chronic and relapsing infection, associated with major financial healthcare costs and significant morbidity and mortality. We address this problem with a two-pronged strategy using 1) antibiotics that target persister cells and 2) ultrasound-stimulated phase-change contrast agents (US-PCCA), which improve antibiotic penetration.

We previously demonstrated that rhamnolipids, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, could induce aminoglycoside uptake in gram-positive organisms, leading to persister cell death. We have also shown that US-PCCA can transiently disrupt biological barriers to improve penetration of therapeutic macromolecules. We hypothesized that combining antibiotics which target persister cells with US-PCCA to improve drug penetration could eradicate methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) biofilms. Aminoglycosides alone or in combination with US-PCCA displayed limited efficacy against MRSA biofilms. In contrast, the anti-persister combination of rhamnolipids and aminoglycosides combined with US-PCCA dramatically reduced biofilm viability, frequently culminating in complete eradication of the biofilm. These data demonstrate that biofilm eradication can be achieved using a combined approach of improving drug penetration of therapeutics that target persister cells.","Durham, P. G.; Sidders, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,123017,Adaptive evolution of phenotypic switching during environmental change,"Microbes are faced with environmental fluctuations and it is therefore important to understand how change affects bacterial evolution and population dynamics. Here, we evolved a model bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, under both constant and changing conditions where settlement by biofilm formation or migration by swimming motility was induced. In changing environments, a heterogeneous population evolved with both specialists and generalists. Interestingly, over time, generalists were outcompeted despite being better at both phenotypes compared to the ancestor. However, generalists became dominant when faced with local competition after resettlement. Reintroduction into a burn wound model, the environment PA14 originally was isolated from, further suggested a tradeoff between niche breadth and peak fitness in agreement with the evolution experiments. Mutations in the c-di-GMP system were key for adaptation of the phenotypes. No mutants lost their ability to regulate c-di-GMP, but generalists acquired mutations that optimized their phenotypic response by efficiently adjusting c-di-GMP levels.","Trivedi, U.; Rebsdorf, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,123194,An expanding bacterial colony forms a depletion zone with growing droplets,"Many species of bacteria have developed means to spread on solid surfaces. This study focuses on the expansion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on an agar gel surface. We report the occurrence and spread of a depletion zone, where the layer of bacteria on the agar becoming thinner. The depletion zone occurs within an expanded colony under conditions of minimal water evaporation. It is colocalized with a higher concentration of rhamnolipids, the biosurfactants that are produced by the bacteria and accumulate in the older region of the colony. With continued growth in bacterial population, dense droplets occur and coalesce in the depletion zone, displaying remarkable fluid dynamic behavior. Whereas expansion of a central depletion zone requires activities of live bacteria, new zones can be seeded by adding rhamnolipids. These depletion zones due to the added surfactants expand quickly, even on plates covered by bacteria that have been killed by ultraviolet light. We propose a model to account for the observed properties, taking into consideration bacterial growth and secretion, osmotic swelling, fluid volume expansion, cell-cell interaction, and interfacial fluid dynamics involving Marangoni flow.

SignificanceBacterial growth and pattern formation have strong bearing on their biological functions, such as their spread and accumulation, biofilm growth & its effects on infection and antibiotic resistance. The bacterial species of this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a human pathogen responsible for frequent infections in wounds, airways, and urinary tract, particularly when involving the use of catheters.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,123392,Examination of a first-in-class bis-dialkylnorspermidine-terphenyl antibiotic in topical formulation against mono and polymicrobial biofilms,"Biofilm-impaired tissue is a significant factor in chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers. Most, if not all, anti-biotics in clinical use have been optimized against planktonic phenotypes. In this study, an in vitro assessment was performed to determine the potential efficacy of a unique first-in-class series of antibiofilm antibiotics and compare outcomes to current clinical standards of care. The agent, CZ-01179, was formulated into a hydrogel and tested against mature biofilms of a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 using two separate methods. In the first method, biofilms were grown on cellulose discs on an agar surface. Topical agents were spread on gauze and placed over the biofilms for 24 h. Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards. In conclusion, CZ-01179 may be a promising topical agent that targets the biofilm phenotype.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,123454,Acquisition of ionic copper by a bacterial outer membrane protein,"Copper, while toxic in excess, is an essential micronutrient in all kingdoms of life due to its essential role in the structure and function of many proteins. Proteins mediating ionic copper import have been characterised in detail for eukaryotes, but much less so for prokaryotes. In particular, it is still unclear whether and how Gram-negative bacteria acquire ionic copper. Here we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa OprC is an outer membrane, TonB-dependent transporter that is conserved in many Proteobacteria and which mediates acquisition of both reduced and oxidised ionic copper via an unprecedented CxxxM-HxM metal binding site. Crystal structures of wild type and mutant OprC variants with silver and copper suggest that acquisition of Cu(I) occurs via a surface-exposed ""methionine track"" leading towards the principal metal binding site. Together with whole-cell copper quantitation and quantitative proteomics in a murine lung infection model, our data identify OprC as an abundant component of bacterial copper biology that may enable copper acquisition under a wide range of conditions.

SignificanceCopper is an essential metal in biology due to its role in the structure and function of many proteins. Despite this, it is not very clear how bacteria acquire copper, especially for Gram-negative organisms. In this study we show that the outer membrane protein OprC has an unusual metal binding site that allows OprC to bind both reduced and oxidised ionic copper near-irreversibly. Given the versatility of OprC, its presence in many Proteobacteria and its abundance during lung infection in mice, our study shows that OprC is an important component of prokaryote copper biology that warrants further study to uncover its regulation and to assess its role in bacterial virulence.","Bhamidimarri, S.; Young, T.; Shanmugam, M.; Soderholm, S.; Basle, A.; Bumann, D.; Van Den Berg, B.",2021-04-06,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.06.04.134395,2,Bert  Van Den Berg,Newcastle University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134395v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.04.134395v2.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,123761,Overproduction of the AlgT sigma factor is lethal to mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from chronic lung infections often overproduce alginate, giving rise to the mucoid phenotype. Isolation of mucoid strains from chronic lung infections correlates with a poor patient outcome. The most common mutation that causes the mucoid phenotype is called mucA22 and results in a truncated form of the anti-sigma factor MucA that is continuously subjected to proteolysis. When a functional MucA is absent, the cognate sigma factor, AlgT, is no longer sequestered and continuously transcribes the alginate biosynthesis operon leading to alginate overproduction. In this work, we report that in the absence of wild-type MucA, providing exogenous AlgT is toxic. This is intriguing since mucoid strains endogenously possess high levels of AlgT. Furthermore, we show that suppressors of toxic AlgT production have mutations in mucP, a protease involved in MucA degradation, and provide the first atomistic model of MucP. Our findings support a model where mutations in mucP stabilize the truncated form of MucA22 rendering it functional and therefore able to reduce toxicity by properly sequestering AlgT.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen capable of causing chronic lung infections. Phenotypes important for the long-term persistence and adaption to this unique lung ecosystem are largely regulated by the AlgT sigma factor. Chronic infection isolates often contain mutations in the anti-sigma factor mucA resulting in uncontrolled AlgT and continuous production of alginate, in addition to the expression of ~300 additional genes including algT itself. Here we report that in the absence of wild-type MucA, AlgT overproduction is lethal and that suppressors of toxic AlgT production have mutations in the MucA protease, MucP. Since AlgT contributes to the establishment of chronic infections, understanding how AlgT is regulated will provide vital information on how P. aeruginosa is capable of causing long-term infections.","Cross, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,124568,A Genome-based Model to Predict the Virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Isolates,"Variation in the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important pathogen, can have dramatic impacts on the bacteriums ability to cause disease. We therefore asked whether it was possible to predict the virulence of P. aeruginosa isolates based upon their genomic content. We applied a machine learning approach to a genetically and phenotypically diverse collection of 115 clinical P. aeruginosa isolates using genomic information and corresponding virulence phenotypes in a mouse model of bacteremia. We defined the accessory genome of these isolates through the presence or absence of accessory genomic elements (AGEs), sequences present in some strains but not others. Machine learning models trained using AGEs were predictive of virulence, with a mean nested cross-validation accuracy of 75% using the random forest algorithm. However, individual AGEs did not have a large influence on the algorithms performance, suggesting instead that the virulence prediction derives from a diffuse genomic signature. These results were validated with an independent test set of 25 P. aeruginosa isolates whose virulence was predicted with 72% accuracy. Machine learning models trained using core genome single nucleotide variants and whole genome k-mers also predicted virulence. Our findings are a proof of concept for the use of bacterial genomes to predict pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa and highlight the potential of this approach for predicting patient outcomes.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a clinically important gram-negative opportunistic pathogen. As a species, P. aeruginosa has a large degree of heterogeneity both through variation in sequences found throughout the species (core genome) and the presence or absence of sequences in different isolates (accessory genome). P. aeruginosa isolates also differ markedly in their ability to cause disease. In this study, we used machine learning to predict the virulence level of P. aeruginosa isolates in a mouse bacteremia model based on genomic content. We show that both the accessory and core genome are predictive of virulence. This study provides a machine learning framework to investigate relationships between bacterial genomes and complex phenotypes such as virulence.","Pincus, N. B.; Ozer, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,124970,PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA VOLATILOME CHARACTERISTICS AND ADAPTATIONS IN CHRONIC CYSTIC FIBROSIS LUNG INFECTIONS,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa chronic lung infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) significantly reduce quality of life and increase morbidity and mortality. Tracking these infections is critical for monitoring patient health and informing treatments. We are working toward the development of novel breath-based biomarkers to track chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections in situ. Using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS), we characterized the in vitro volatile metabolomes (or volatilomes) of 81 P. aeruginosa isolates collected from 17 CF patients over at least a five-year period of their chronic lung infections. We detected 539 volatiles produced by the P. aeruginosa isolates, 69 of which were core volatiles that were highly conserved. We found that each early infection isolate has a unique volatilome, and as infection progresses, the volatilomes of isolates from the same patient become increasingly dissimilar, to the point that these intra-patient isolates are no more similar to one another than to isolates from other patients. We observed that the size and chemical diversity of P. aeruginosa volatilomes do not change over the course of chronic infections; however, the relative abundances of core hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aldehydes do change, and are correlated to changes in phenotypes associated with chronic infections. This study indicates that it may be feasible to track P. aeruginosa chronic lung infections by measuring changes to the infection volatilome, and lays the groundwork for exploring the translatability of this approach to direct measurement using patient breath.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF), and are correlated with lung function declines. Significant clinical efforts are, therefore, aimed at detecting infections and tracking them for phenotypic changes, such as mucoidy and antibiotic resistance. Both the detection and tracking of lung infections relies on sputum cultures, but due to improvements in CF therapies, sputum production is declining though risks for lung infections persist. Therefore, we are working toward the development of breath-based diagnostics for CF lung infections. In this study we characterized of the volatile metabolomes of 81 P. aeruginosa clinical isolates collected from 17 CF patients over a duration of at least five years of a chronic lung infection. We found that the volatilome of P. aeruginosa adapts over time, and correlates to infection phenotype changes, suggesting it may be possible to track chronic CF lung infections with a breath test.","Davis, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125250,Mobile element warfare via CRISPR and anti-CRISPR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria deploy multiple defense mechanisms to prevent the invasion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs). CRISPR-Cas systems use RNA-guided nucleases to target MGEs, which in turn produce anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins that inactivate Cas protein effectors. The minimal component Type I-C CRISPR-Cas subtype is highly prevalent in bacteria, and yet a lack of a tractable in vivo model system has slowed its study, the identification of cognate Acr proteins, and thus our understanding of its true role in nature. Here, we describe MGE-MGE conflict between a mobile Pseudomonas aeruginosa Type I-C CRISPR-Cas system always encoded on pKLC102-like conjugative elements, which are large mobile islands, and seven new Type I-C anti-CRISPRs (AcrIF2*, AcrIC3-IC8) encoded by phages, other mobile islands, and transposons. The P. aeruginosa Type I-C system possesses a total of 300 non-redundant spacers (from 980 spacers total) across the 42 genomes analyzed, predominantly targeting P. aeruginosa phages. Of the seven new Type I-C anti-CRISPRs, all but one are highly acidic, and four have surprisingly broad inhibition activity, blocking multiple distantly related P. aeruginosa Type I CRISPR system subtypes (e.g. I-C and I-F, or I-C and I-E), including AcrIF2 (now, AcrIF2*), a previously described DNA mimic. Anti-type I-C activity of AcrIF2* was far more sensitive to mutagenesis of acidic residues in AcrIF2* than anti-type I-F activity, suggesting distinct binding mechanisms for this highly negatively charged protein. Five of the seven Acr proteins block DNA-binding, while the other two act downstream of DNA-binding, likely by preventing Cas3 recruitment or activity. For one such Cas3 inhibitor (AcrIC3), we identify a novel anti-CRISPR evasion strategy: a cas3-cas8 gene fusion, which also occurs in nature. Collectively, the Type I-C CRISPR spacer diversity and corresponding anti-CRISPR response, all occurring on Pseudomonas MGEs, demonstrates an active co-evolutionary battle between parasitic elements.","Leon, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125188,Bacterial mobbing behavior: coordinated communal attack of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on a protozoan predator,"Mobbing, a group attack of prey on predator, is a strategy enacted by many animal species. Here we report bacterial mobbing carried out by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa towards Acanthamoeba castellanii, a common bacterivore. This behavior consists of bacterial taxis towards the amoebae, adhesion en masse to amoebae cells, and eventual killing of the amoebae. Mobbing behavior transpires in seconds timescale and responds to predator population density. A mutant defective in the production of a specific quorum sensing signal displays reduced adhesion to amoeba cells. This deficiency ameliorated by external addition of the missing signal molecule. The same quorum sensing mutant also expresses long term deficiency in its ability to cause amoeba death and shows higher susceptibility to predation, highlighting the importance of group coordination to mobbing and predation avoidance. These findings portray bacterial mobbing as a regulated and dynamic group behavior.","Shteindel, N.; Gerchman, Y.",2020-06-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.06.15.152132,1,Nimrod  Shteindel,University of Haifa,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152132v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.15.152132v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125421,Quorum sensing-induced phenotypic switching as a regulatory nutritional stress response in a competitive two-species biofilm: An individual-based cellular automata model,"Competition for nutrients in a polymicrobial biofilm may lead to susceptible species being subjected to nutritional stress. The influence of bacterial growth rates and interspecies interactions on their susceptibility and response to nutritional stress is not well understood. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two prevalent causative pathogens that coexist in biofilm-associated infections. Despite being the slower-growing species, P. aeruginosa dominates in a two-species biofilm by inducing phenotypic switching of S. aureus to a metabolically-challenged small colony variant (SCV) via the release of 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). We hypothesize that P. aeruginosa experiences nutritional stress in competition with S. aureus, and that the release of HQNO is an adaptive response to nutritional stress. We present an individual-based two-species biofilm model in which interactions between entities induce emergent properties. As the biofilm matured, the difference in growth rates of the two species caused a non-uniform distribution of nutrients leading to nutritional stress for P. aeruginosa and a concurrent increase in the proportion of S. aureus subpopulation. The latter resulted in increased release of autoinducer, and subsequently the upregulation of P. aeruginosa cells via quorum sensing. Upregulated P. aeruginosa cells released HQNO at enhanced rates, thereby inducing phenotypic switching of S. aureus to SCVs which consume nutrient at a reduced rate. This shifted the nutrient distribution back in favor of P. aeruginosa, thereby relieving nutritional stress. Increase in nutritional stress potentiated the transformation of S. aureus into SCVs. HQNO production decreased once nutritional stress was relieved, indicating that phenotypic switching acts as a regulatory stress-adaptive response.","Chirathanamettu, T. R.; Pawar, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes surgical site, burn wound, and hospital acquired infections, and is also associated with aggressive biofilm formation in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. A potent but poorly understood contributor to P. aeruginosa virulence is the ability to produce outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). OMV trafficking has been associated with cell-to-cell communication, virulence factor delivery, and the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Because OMVs have almost exclusively been studied using planktonic cultures, little is known about their biogenesis and function in biofilms. Our group has shown that the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS) induces OMV formation in P. aeruginosa, and in other species, through a biophysical mechanism that is also active in biofilms. Here, we demonstrate that PQS-induced OMV production is highly dynamic during biofilm development. Interestingly, PQS and OMV synthesis are significantly elevated during dispersion, compared to attachment and maturation stages. PQS biosynthetic and receptor mutant biofilms were significantly impaired in their ability to disperse, but this phenotype could be rescued by genetic complementation or exogenous addition of PQS. Finally, we show that purified OMVs can actively degrade extracellular protein, lipid, and DNA. We therefore propose that enhanced production of PQS-induced OMVs during biofilm dispersion facilitates cell escape by coordinating the controlled degradation of biofilm matrix components.

ImportanceTreatments that manipulate biofilm dispersion hold the potential to convert chronic drug-tolerant biofilm infections from protected sessile communities into released populations that are orders-of-magnitude more susceptible to antimicrobial treatment. However, dispersed cells often exhibit increased acute virulence and dissemination phenotypes. A thorough understanding of the dispersion process is therefore critical before this promising strategy can be effectively employed. PQS has been implicated in early biofilm development, but we hypothesized that its function as an OMV inducer may contribute at multiple stages. Here, we demonstrate that PQS and OMVs are differentially produced during Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development and that effective biofilm dispersion is dependent on production of PQS-induced OMVs, which likely act as delivery vehicles for matrix degrading enzymes. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding the roles of OMVs in biofilm development and suggest a model to explain the controlled matrix degradation that accompanies biofilm dispersion in many species.","Cooke, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125563,Towards a new treatment against polymicrobial infections: high antibacterial activity of lemon IntegroPectin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli,"Lemon IntegroPectin obtained via hydrodynamic cavitation of waste lemon peel in water only shows high antibacterial activity against two Gram-negative bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The antibacterial effect against the ubiquitous pathogen P. aeruginosa was evaluated in terms of the minimal bactericidal (MBC) and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Preliminary insight on the antibacterial mechanism of IntegroPectin originates from investigating its inhibitory activity against E. coli. Given the non-cytotoxic nature of citrus IntegroPectin and the ease of its reproducible production in large amounts, the route is open to the industrial development of a new antimicrobial treatment against polymicrobial infections unlikely to develop drug resistance.","Presentato, A.; Scurria, A.; Albanese, L.; Picone, P.; Pagliaro, M.; Zabini, F.; Meneguzzo, F.; Alduina, R.; Nuzzo, D.; Ciriminna, R.",2020-06-17,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.06.16.154229,1,Rosaria  Ciriminna,CNR,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154229v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.16.154229v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125540,Quantitative mapping of mRNA 3' ends in Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals a pervasive role for premature 3' end formation in response to azithromycin,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces serious chronic infections in hospitalized patients and immunocompromised individuals, including patients with cystic fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms by which P. aeruginosa responds to antibiotics and other stresses to promote persistent infections may provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Azithromycin (AZM), an antibiotic frequently used in cystic fibrosis treatment, is thought to improve clinical outcomes through a number of mechanisms including impaired biofilm growth and quorum sensing (QS). The mechanisms underlying the transcriptional response to AZM remain unclear. Here, we interrogated the P. aeruginosa transcriptional response to AZM using a fast, cost-effective genome-wide approach to quantitate RNA 3 ends (3pMap). We also identified hundreds of P. aeruginosa genes with high incidence of premature 3 end formation indicative of riboregulation in their transcript leaders using 3pMap. AZM treatment of planktonic and biofilm cultures alters the expression of hundreds of genes, including those involved in QS, biofilm formation, and virulence. Strikingly, most genes downregulated by AZM in biofilms had increased levels of intragenic 3 ends indicating premature transcription termination, transcriptional pausing, or accumulation of stable intermediates resulting from the action of nucleases. Reciprocally, AZM reduced premature intragenic 3 end termini in many upregulated genes. Most notably, reduced termination accompanied robust induction of obgE, a GTPase involved in persister formation in P. aeruginosa. Our results support a model in which AZM-induced changes in 3 end formation alter the expression of central regulators which in turn impairs the expression of QS, biofilm formation and stress response genes, while upregulating genes associated with persistence.","Konikkat, S.; Scribner, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,125709,Trophic cooperation promotes bacterial survival of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"In the context of infection, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are frequently co-isolated, particularly in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Within lungs, the two pathogens exhibit a range of competitive and coexisting interactions. In the present study, we explored the impact of S. aureus on the physiology of P. aeruginosa in the context of coexistence. Transcriptomic analyses showed that S. aureus significantly and specifically affects the expression of numerous genes involved in P. aeruginosa carbon and amino acid metabolism. In particular, 65% of the strains presented considerable overexpression of the genes involved in the acetoin catabolic (aco) pathway. We demonstrated that acetoin is (i) produced by clinical S. aureus strains, (ii) detected in sputa from CF patients, and (iii) involved in P. aeruginosas aco system induction. Furthermore, acetoin is catabolized by P. aeruginosa, a metabolic process that improves the survival of both pathogens by providing a new carbon source for P. aeruginosa and avoiding the toxic accumulation of acetoin on S. aureus. Due to its beneficial effects on both bacteria, acetoin catabolism could testify to the establishment of trophic cooperation between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in the CF lung environment, thus promoting their persistence.","Camus, L.; Briaud, P.; Bastien, S.; Elsen, S.; Doleans-Jordheim, A.; Vandenesch, F.; Moreau, K.",2020-06-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.06.17.156968,1,Karen  Moreau,CIRI,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.156968v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.156968v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41396-020-00741-9
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,126373,Iron limitation by transferrin promotes simultaneous cheating of pyoverdine and exoprotease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main bacterial model to study cooperative behaviors, since it yields exoproducts such as exoproteases and siderophores that act as public goods and can be exploited by selfish non-producers that behave as social cheaters. Non-producers of the siderophore pyoverdine are typically isolated in media with low free iron, mainly casamino acids medium supplemented with transferrin. Nevertheless, using a protein as the iron chelator could additionally select mutants unable to produce exoproteases that degrade the transferrin to facilitate iron release. Here, we investigated the dynamics of pyoverdine and exoprotease production in media in which iron was limited by using either transferrin or a cation chelating resin. Our experiments show that concomitant loss of pyoverdine and exoprotease production readily develops in media with transferrin whereas only lack of pyoverdine emerges in medium treated with the resin. Genomic characterization of the exoprotease- and pyoverdine-less mutants revealed large deletions (13 to 33 Kb) including Quorum Sensing (lasR, rsal and lasl) and flagellar genes. Complementation experiments, PCR and motility tests confirmed the deletions. Our work shows that using transferrin as an iron chelator imposes simultaneous selective pressure for the loss of pyoverdine and exoprotease production. The unintended effect of transferrin observed in our experiment settings can help revisiting or informing the design of similar studies.","Tostado-Islas, O.; Mendoza-Ortiz, A.; Ramirez-Garcia, G.; Cabrera-Takane, I.

In vitro transcription reactions were successfully re-constituted using such nuclear extract. Furthermore, two non-radioactive detection methods, PCR and qRT-PCR, have been adapted into our system to qualitatively and quantitatively detect transcription, respectively. Using this system to assess how pathogen infection affects C. elegans transcription revealed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection increased transcription activity. Our in vitro system is useful for biochemically studying C. elegans transcription mechanisms and gene expression regulations.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,126522,The small RNA ErsA plays a role in the regulatory network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity in airways infection,"Bacterial small RNAs play a remarkable role in the regulation of functions involved in host-pathogen interaction. ErsA is a small RNA of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that contributes to the regulation of bacterial virulence traits such as biofilm formation and motility. Shown to take part in a regulatory circuit under the control of the envelope stress response sigma factor {sigma}22, ErsA targets post-transcriptionally the key virulence-associated gene algC. Moreover, ErsA contributes to biofilm development and motility through the post-transcriptional modulation of the transcription factor AmrZ. Intending to evaluate the regulatory relevance of ErsA in the pathogenesis of respiratory infections, we analyzed the impact of ErsA-mediated regulation on the virulence potential of P. aeruginosa and the stimulation of the inflammatory response during the infection of bronchial epithelial cells and a murine model. Furthermore, we assessed ErsA expression in a collection of P. aeruginosa clinical pulmonary isolates and investigated the link of ErsA with acquired antibiotic resistance by generating an ersA gene deletion mutant in a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strain which has long been adapted in the airways of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. Our results show that the ErsA-mediated regulation is relevant for the P. aeruginosa pathogenicity during acute infection and contributes to the stimulation of the host inflammatory response. Besides, ErsA could be subjected to selective pressure for P. aeruginosa patho-adaptation and acquirement of resistance to antibiotics commonly used in clinical practice during chronic CF infections. Our findings establish the role of ErsA as an important regulatory element in the host-pathogen interaction.

Author summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most critical multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogen in humans, able to cause both lethal acute and chronic lung infections. Thorough knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms involved in the establishment and persistence of the airways infections by P. aeruginosa remains elusive. Emerging candidates as molecular regulators of pathogenesis in P. aeruginosa are small RNAs, which act post-transcriptionally as signal transducers of host cues. Known for being involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and responsive to envelope stress response, we show that the small RNA ErsA can play regulatory roles in acute infection, stimulation of host inflammatory response, mechanisms of acquirement of antibiotic resistance and adaptation during the chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients. Elucidating the complexity of the networks regulating host-pathogen interaction is crucial to identify novel targets for future therapeutic applications.","Ferrara, S.; Rossi, A.; Ranucci, S.; De Fino, I.; Bragonzi, A.; Cigana, C.; Bertoni, G.",2020-06-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.06.22.164558,2,Giovanni  Bertoni,Università degli Studi di Milano,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164558v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.22.164558v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1128/msphere.00909-20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,126940,TLR5 signalling activates the alternative NF-κB signalling pathway in Cystic Fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells in response to infection with Prevotella histicola.,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations affecting the CFTR gene, is characterised by viscid secretions in multiple organ systems. CF airways contain thick mucus, creating a gradient of hypoxia, which promotes the establishment of polymicrobial infection. Such inflammation predisposes to further infection, a self-perpetuating cycle in mediated by NF-{kappa}B. Anaerobic Gram-negative Prevotella spp. are found in sputum from healthy volunteers and CF patients and in CF lungs correlate with reduced levels of inflammation. Prevotella histicola (P.histicola) can suppress murine lung inflammation, however, no studies have examined the role of P.histicola in modulating infection and inflammation in the CF airways. We investigated innate immune signalling and NF-kB activation in CF epithelial cells CFBE41o-in response to clinical stains of P.histicola and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa). Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) expressing HEK-293 cells and siRNA assays for TLRs and IKKa were used to confirm signalling pathways.

We show that P.histicola infection activated the alternative NF-kB signalling pathway in CF bronchial epithelial cells inducing HIF-1 protein. TLR5 signalling was responsible for the induction of the alternative NF-kB pathway through phosphorylation of IKK. The induction of transcription factor HIF-1 was inversely associated with the induction of the alternative NF-kB pathway and knockdown of IKK partially restored canonical NF-kB activation in response to P.histicola.

This study demonstrates that different bacterial species in the respiratory microbiome can contribute differently to inflammation, either by activating inflammatory cascades (P.aeruginosa) or by muting the inflammatory response by modulating similar or related pathways (P.histicola). Further work is required to assess the complex interactions of the lung microbiome in response to mixed bacterial infections and their effects in people with CF.","Schock, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,127023,Evaluation of ExoU inhibitors in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa scratch infection assay,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has recently been highlighted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a major threat with high priority for the development of new therapies. The type III secretion system of P. aeruginosa delivers the toxin ExoU into the cytosol of target host cells, where its plasma membrane directed phospholipase activity induces rapid cell lysis. Therefore, inhibition of the phospholipase activity of ExoU would be an important treatment strategy in P. aeruginosa infections. We evaluated a panel of ExoU small molecule inhibitors, previously identified from high throughput cellular based assays, and analysed their inhibition of ExoU phospholipase activity in vitro. A corneal epithelial (HCE-T) scratch and infection model using florescence microscopy, and cell viability assays, were used to test the efficacy of compounds to inhibit ExoU from P. aeruginosa. Compounds Pseudolipasin A, compound A and compound B were effective at mitigating ExoU mediated cytotoxicity after infection at concentrations as low as 0.5 M. Importantly, by using the antimicrobials moxifloxacin and tobramycin to control bacterial load, these assays were extended from 6 h to 24 h. P. aeruginosa remained cytotoxic to HCE-T cells with moxifloxacin, present at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for 24 h, but, when used in combination with either PSA, compound A or compound B, partial scratch healing was observed. These results provide evidence that ExoU inhibitors could be used in combination with certain antimicrobials as a novel means to treat clinical infections of ExoU producing P. aeruginosa.","Foulkes, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,127220,The Gb3-enriched CD59/flotillin plasma membrane domain regulates host cell invasion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a high number of acute and chronic hospital-acquired infections. As it develops more and more resistances against existing antibiotics, P. aeruginosa has been placed highest on the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for which alternative treatments are urgently needed. Former studies have highlighted the crucial role of the bacterial lectin LecA and the host cell glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) for the cellular uptake of P. aeruginosa into epithelial cells via the lipid zipper mechanism. To further characterize the host cell plasma membrane domain for LecA-driven attachment and invasion, we analyzed the protein and lipid composition of pulled-down membrane domains for novel interaction partners of LecA by mass spectrometry. We unraveled a predilection of LecA for binding to saturated Gb3 species in the extracellular membrane leaflet and an induction of dynamic phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate clusters at the intracellular leaflet co-localizing with sites of LecA binding. Moreover, we identified the GPI-anchored protein CD59 and flotillins, known as cargo and eponymous component of flotillin-assisted endocytosis, as LecA interaction partners. Depletion of each of these host cell proteins resulted in more than 50% of reduction in invasiveness of the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 highlighting the importance of this LecA-induced plasma membrane domain. Our strategy to reduce the complexity of host-pathogen interactions by first identifying interaction partners of a single virulence factor and subsequently transferring these findings to the bacterium has been proven to be a successful approach in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bacterial infections.","Brandel, A.; Aigal, S.; Lagies, S.; Schlimpert, M.; Lehmann, A.; Hummel, D.; Fisch, D.; Melendez, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,127427,Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses c-di-GMP phosphodiesterases RmcA and MorA to regulate biofilm maintenance,"While the early stages of biofilm formation have been well characterized, less is known about the requirements for Pseudomonas aeruginosa to maintain a mature biofilm. We utilized a P. aeruginosa-phage interaction to find that rmcA and morA, two genes which encode for c-di-GMP-degrading phosphodiesterase (PDEs) enzymes, are important for the regulation of biofilm maintenance. Deletion of these genes initially results in an elevated biofilm phenotype characterized by increased production of c-di-GMP, Pel polysaccharide and biofilm biomass. In contrast to the wild-type strain, these mutants were unable to maintain the biofilm when exposed to carbon-limited conditions. The susceptibility to nutrient limitation, and subsequent loss of biofilm viability of these mutants, was phenotypically reproduced with a stringent response mutant ({Delta}relA {Delta}spoT), indicating that the {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutants may be unable to appropriately respond to nutrient limitation. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that RmcA and MorA physically interact with the Pel biosynthesis machinery, supporting a model whereby unregulated Pel biosynthesis contributes to the death of the {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutant strains in an established biofilm when nutrient-limited. These findings provide evidence that c-di-GMP-mediated regulation is required for mature biofilms of P. aeruginosa to effectively respond to changing availability of nutrients. Furthermore, the PDEs involved in biofilm maintenance are distinct from those required for establishing a biofilm, thus indicating that a wide variety of c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes in organisms like P. aeruginosa likely allows for discrete control over the formation, maintenance or dispersion of biofilms.

ImportanceRecent advances in our understanding of c-di-GMP signaling have provided key insights into the regulation of biofilms. Despite an improved understanding of how they initially form, the processes that facilitate the long-term maintenance of these multicellular communities remain opaque. We found that P. aeruginosa requires two phosphodiesterases, RmcA and MorA, to maintain a mature biofilm and that P. aeruginosa biofilms lacking these PDEs succumb to nutrient limitation and die. The biofilm maintenance deficiency observed in {Delta}rmcA and {Delta}morA mutants was also found in the stringent response defective {Delta}relA {Delta}spoT strain, suggesting that a regulatory intersection between c-di-GMP signaling, EPS biosynthesis and the nutrient limitation response is important for persistent surface growth. We uncover components of an important regulatory system needed for P. aeruginosa to persist in nutrient-poor conditions, and provide some of the first evidence that maintaining a mature biofilm is an active process.","Katharios-Lanwermeyer, S.; Whitfield, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,129721,Evolutionary responses to codon usage of horizontally transferred genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Prokaryote genome evolution is characterized by the frequent gain of genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For a gene, being horizontally transferred can represent a strong change in its genomic and physiological context. If the codon usage of a transferred gene deviates from that of the receiving organism, the fitness benefits it provides can be reduced due to a mismatch with the expression machinery. Consequently, transferred genes with a deviating codon usage can be selected against or elicit evolutionary responses that enhance their integration. In this study, a comparative genomics approach was used to investigate evolutionary responses after the horizontal transfer of genes with diverse degrees of codon usage mismatch in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Selection on codon usage of genes acquired through HGT was observed, with the overall codon usage converging towards that of the core genome over evolutionary time. This pattern seemed to be mainly driven by selective retention of transferred genes with an initial codon usage similar to that of the core genes. Gene amelioration, through the accumulation of synonymous mutations after HGT, did not seem to systematically affect transferred genes. Additionally, variation in the copy number of tRNA genes was often associated with the acquisition of genes for which the observed variation could enhance their expression. This provides evidence that compensatory evolution might be an important mechanism for the integration of horizontally transferred genes.",Martijn Callens; Celine Scornavacca; Stéphanie Bedhomme,2020-07-11,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2020.07.11.198432,1,Martijn  Callens,CEFE - CNRS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198432v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.11.198432v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1099/mgen.0.000587
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,130284,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of inhaled antipseudomonal bacteriophage therapy in mice,"Inhaled bacteriophage (phage) therapy is a potential alternative to conventional antibiotic therapy to combat multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. However, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of phages are fundamentally different to antibiotics and the lack of understanding potentially limits optimal dosing. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo PK and PD profiles of antipseudomonal phage PEV31 delivered by pulmonary route in mice. BALB/c mice were administered phage PEV31 at doses of 107 and 109 PFU by the intratracheal route. Mice (n = 4) were sacrificed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-treatment and various tissues (lungs, kidney, spleen and liver), bronchoalveolar lavage and blood were collected for phage quantification. In a separate study, mice (n = 4) were treated with PEV31 (109 PFU) or PBS at 2 h post-inoculation with MDR P. aeruginosa. Infective PEV31 and bacteria were enumerated from the lungs. In the phage only study, PEV31 titer gradually decreased in the lungs over 24 hours with a half-life of approximately 8 h for both doses. In the presence of bacteria, PEV31 titer increased by almost 2-log10 in the lungs at 16 h. Furthermore, bacterial growth was suppressed in the PEV31-treated group, while the PBS-treated group showed exponential growth. Some phage-resistant colonies were observed from the lung homogenates sampled at 24 h post-phage treatment. These colonies had a different antibiogram to the parent bacteria.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,130482,Pseudomonas aeruginosa detachment from surfaces via a self-made small molecule,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant threat in both healthcare and industrial biofouling. Surface attachment of P. aeruginosa is particularly problematic as surface association induces virulence and biofilm formation, which hamper later antibiotic treatments. Previous efforts have searched for biofilm dispersal agents, but there are no known factors that specifically disperse surface-attached P. aeruginosa. In this study we develop a quantitative surface-dispersal assay and use it to show that P. aeruginosa itself produces factors that can stimulate its dispersal. Through bioactivity-guided fractionation, Mass Spectrometry, and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, we elucidated the structure of one such factor, 2-methyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (MHQ). MHQ is an alkyl-quinolone with a previously unknown activity and is synthesized by the PqsABC enzymes. Pure MHQ is sufficient to disperse P. aeruginosa, but the dispersal activity of natural P. aeruginosa conditioned media requires additional factors. Whereas other alkyl quinolones have been shown to act as antibiotics or membrane depolarizers, MHQ lacks these activities and known antibiotics do not induce dispersal. In contrast, we show that MHQ inhibits the activity of Type IV Pili (TFP) and that TFP targeting can explain its dispersal activity. Our work thus identifies surface dispersal as a new activity of P. aeruginosa-produced small molecules, characterizes MHQ as a promising dispersal agent, and establishes TFP inhibition as a viable mechanism for P. aeruginosa dispersal.

Significance StatementWe discovered that the clinically relevant human bacterial pathogen P. aeruginosa, typically associated with surface-based infections, is dispersed by a small molecule that the bacteria themselves produce. We elucidate the chemical structure of this molecule and find that mechanistically it functions to inhibit the activity of the P. aeruginosa extra cellular surface motility appendage, the type IV pilus.","Scheffler, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,130368,Metabolic flux fingerprinting differentiates planktonic and biofilm states of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus,"The challenges of defining the biofilm phenotype has been clear for decades. Many biomarkers for biofilm are known, but methods for identifying these are often invasive and/or complicated. These methods often rely on disrupting the biofilm matrix or examining virulence factors and compounds, which may only be expressed under certain conditions.

We used microcalorimetric measurements of metabolic energy release to investigate whether unchallenged, planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed differences in metabolism compared to surface-bound and non-attached biofilms.

The pattern of energy release observed in the recorded microcalorimetric thermograms clearly depended on growth state, though the total energy expenditure was not different between growth states. To characterize these differences, we developed a classification pipeline utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify growth state, based on the observed patterns of energy release. With this approach, we could with high accuracy detect the growth form of blinded samples. To challenge the algorithm, we attempted to limit the amount of training data. By training the algorithm with only a single data point from each growth form, we obtained a mean accuracy of 90.5% using two principal components. Further validation of the classification pipeline showed that the approach was not limited to P. aeruginosa but could also be used for detection of gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus biofilm. We propose that microcalorimetric measurements, in combination with this new quantitative framework, can be used as a non-invasive biomarker to detect the presence of biofilm.

These results could have a significant potential in clinical settings where the detection of biofilms in infections often means a different outcome and treatment regime for the patient.","Lichtenberg, M.; Kragh, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,130406,An experimentally evolved variant of RsmA confirms its central role in the control of Pseudomonas aeruginosa social motility,"Bacteria can colonize a variety of different environments by modulating their gene regulation using two-component systems. The versatile opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been studied for its capacity to adapt to a broad range of environmental conditions. The Gac/Rsm pathway is composed of the sensor kinase GacS, that detects environmental cues, and the response regulator GacA, that modulates the expression of a specific genes. This system, through the sRNA repressors RsmY and RsmZ, negatively controls the activity of the protein RsmA, which is centrally involved in the transition from chronic to acute infections by post-transcriptionally regulating several virulence functions. RsmA positively regulates swarming motility, a social surface behaviour. Through a poorly defined mechanism, RsmA is also indirectly regulated by HptB, and a {Delta}hptB mutant exhibits a severe swarming defect. Since a {Delta}hptB mutant retains all the known functions required for that type of motility, we used an experimental evolution approach to identify elements responsible for its swarming defect. After a few passages under swarming conditions, the defect of the {Delta}hptB mutant was rescued by the emergence of spontaneous single nucleotide substitutions in the gacA and rsmA genes. Since GacA indirectly represses RsmA activity, it was coherent that an inactivating mutation in gacA would compensate the {Delta}hptB swarming defect. However, the effect of the mutation in rsmA was unexpected since RsmA promotes swarming; indeed, using expression reporters, we found that the mutation that does not abolish its activity. Instead, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and molecular simulations, we show that this variant of RsmA is actually less amenable to titration by its cognate repressor RsmY, supporting the other phenotypes observed for this mutant. These results confirm the central role of RsmA as a regulator of swarming motility in P. aeruginosa and identify residues crucial for RsmA function in social motility.

Author summaryBacteria need to readily adapt to their environment. Two-component systems (TCS) allow such adaption by triggering bacterial regulation changes through the detection of environmental cues. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses more than 60 TCS in its genome. The Gac/Rsm is a TCS extensively studied for its implication in virulence regulation. This system regulates the transition between chronic and acute bacterial infection behaviours. To acquire a better understanding of this regulation, we performed a directed experimental evolution on a swarming-deficient mutant in a poorly understood regulatory component of the Gac/Rsm pathway. We observed single nucleotide substitutions that allowed restoration of a swarming phenotype similar to the wild-type behaviour. More specifically, mutations were found in the gacA and rsmA genes. Interestingly, the observed mutation in rsmA does not result in loss of function of the protein but rather alters its susceptibility to repression by its cognate interfering sRNA. Since modification in the RNA sequence of RsmA results in the rescue of swarming motility, we confirm the central role of this posttranscriptional repressor in this social lifestyle.","Robitaille, S.; Lopez De Los Santos, Y.; Groleau, M.-C.; Jean-Pierre, F.; Doucet, N.; Perreault, J.; Deziel, E.",2020-07-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.07.15.203992,1,Eric  Déziel,INRS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203992v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.203992v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,131039,Statistical classification of dynamic bacterial growth with sub-inhibitory concentrations of nanoparticles and its implications for disease treatment,"Nanoparticles are promising alternatives to antibiotics since nanoparticles are easy to manufacture, non-toxic, and do not promote resistance. Nanoparticles act via physical disruption of the bacterial membrane and/or the generation of high concentrations of reactive-oxygen species locally. Potential for physical disruption of the bacterial membrane may be quantified by free energy methods, such as the extended Derjuan-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, which predicts the initial surface-material interactions. The generation of reactive-oxygen species may be quantified using enthalpies of formation to predict minimum inhibitory concentrations. Neither of these two quantitative structure-activity values describes the dynamic, in situ behavioral changes in the bacterias struggle to survive. In this paper, borrowing parameters from logistic, oscillatory, and diauxic growth models, we use principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to classify survival modes across nanoparticle types and concentrations. We compare the growth parameters of 170 experimental interactions between nanoparticles and bacteria. The bacteria studied include Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Helicobacter pylori, and were tested across multiple concentrations of liposomal drug delivery systems, amphiphilic peptide, and silver and selenium nanoparticles. Clustering reveals specific pairs of bacteria and nanoparticles where the nanoparticle induced growth dynamics could potentially spread the infection through the development of resistance and tolerance. This rapid screening also shows that bacteria generated nanoparticles do not induce growth modes indicative of the development of resistance. This methodology can be used to rapidly screen for novel therapeutics that do not induce resistance before using more robust intracellular content screening. This methodology can also be used as a quality check on batch manufactured nanoparticles.","Jones, A.-A. D.; Medina-Cruz, D.; Kim, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,131251,Two isoforms of the essential C. elegans Argonaute CSR-1 differentially regulate sperm and oocyte fertility,"The C. elegans genome encodes nineteen functional Argonaute proteins that utilize 22G-RNAs, 26G-RNAs, miRNAs, or piRNAs to regulate their target transcripts. Only one Argonaute is essential under normal laboratory conditions: CSR-1. While CSR-1 has been studied widely, nearly all studies have overlooked the fact that the csr-1 locus encodes two isoforms. These isoforms differ by an additional 163 amino acids present in the N-terminus of CSR-1a. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to introduce GFP::3xFLAG into the long (CSR-1a) and short (CSR-1b) isoforms, we found that CSR-1a is expressed during spermatogenesis and in several somatic tissues, including the intestine. CSR-1b is expressed constitutively in the germline. small RNA sequencing of CSR-1 complexes shows that they interact with partly overlapping sets of 22G-RNAs. Phenotypic analyses reveal that the essential functions of csr-1 described in the literature coincide with CSR-1b, while CSR-1a plays tissue specific functions. During spermatogenesis, CSR-1a integrates into an sRNA regulatory network including ALG-3, ALG-4, and WAGO-10 that is necessary for fertility at 25{degrees}C. In the intestine, CSR-1a silences immunity and pathogen-responsive genes, and its loss results in improved survival from the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our findings functionally distinguish the CSR-1 isoforms and highlight the importance of studying each AGO isoform independently.","Charlesworth, A. G.; Seroussi, U.; Lehrbach, N. J.; Renaud, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,131589,Use of IL-6-elafin genetically modified regulatory macrophages as an immunotherapeutic against acute bacterial infection in the lung,"BackgroundPseudomonas aeruginosa (P.a) infections are a major public health issue in ventilator-associated pneumoniae, cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. This bacterium is multidrug resistant and there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic approaches.

ObjectiveEvaluate the effect of direct pulmonary transplantation of gene-modified (elafin and IL-6) syngeneic macrophages in a mouse model of acute of P.a infection.

MethodsWild type (WT) or Elafin-transgenic (eTg) alveolar macrophages (AMs) or bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were recovered from broncho-alveolar lavage or generated from WT or eTg mice bone marrow. Cells were modified with adenovirus IL-6 (Ad-IL6), characterized in vitro (RNA expression, protein secretion, surface markers) and transferred by oropharyngeal instillation in the lungs of naive mice. The protective effect of the transferred macrophages was assessed during P.a acute infection (survival studies, mechanistic studies of the inflammatory response).

ResultsWe show that the transfer in the lung of a single bolus of syngeneic AMs or BMDMs genetically modified with IL6 and Elafin provided protection in our pneumonia P.a-induced model. Mechanistically, Elafin-modified AM had an IL-6-IL-10-IL-4R-IL-22-antimicrobial molecular signature which, in synergy with IL-6, conferred, post-transfer, a regulatory phenotype to the alveolar unit.

ConclusionHere we introduce an immunotherapy approach employing gene-modified syngeneic macrophages to target bacterial airway infections. The absence of adverse events during our experiments suggests that our approach is well tolerated and supports the feasibility of translating this therapy to patients suffering from lung acute bacterial infections.","Kheir, S.; Villeret, B.; Garcia-Verdugo, I.; Sallenave, J.-M.",2020-07-23,Immunology,10.1101/2020.07.22.214684,1,Jean-Michel  Sallenave,"INSERM U1152, Laboratoire d'Excellence Inflamex, Université de Paris, Hopital Bichat",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.214684v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.22.214684v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.rmr.2021.02.031
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,131766,Dual-purpose isocyanides produced by Aspergillus fumigatus contribute to cellular copper sufficiency and exhibit antimicrobial activity,"The maintenance of sufficient but non-toxic pools of metal micronutrients is accomplished through diverse homeostasis mechanisms in fungi. Siderophores play a well-established role for iron homeostasis; however, no copper-binding analogs have been found in fungi. Here we demonstrate that in Aspergillus fumigatus isocyanides derived from the xan biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) bind copper, impact cellular copper content, and have significant metal-dependent antimicrobial properties. xan BGC-derived isocyanides are secreted and bind copper as visualized by a chrome azurol S (CAS) assay and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of A. fumigatus intracellular copper pools demonstrated a role for xan cluster metabolites in the accumulation of copper. A. fumigatus coculture with A. nidulans, Candida albicans and a variety of pathogenic bacteria establish copper-dependent antimicrobial properties of xan BGC metabolites including inhibition of laccase activity. Similarly, inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by low concentrations of the xan isocyanide xanthocillin was copper-dependent. Other metals also reduced xanthocillins antimicrobial properties, but less efficiently than copper. As variations of the xan BGC exist in other filamentous fungi, we suggest that xanthocillin-like natural products represent a first example for fungal small molecules that serve to maintain copper sufficiency and mediate interactions with competing microbes.

SignificanceMetal homeostasis is an integral part of metabolism for any organism. A vast array of small molecules are already known to mediate metal homeostasis in fungi and bacteria; however, unlike their bacterial counterparts, to-date there are no known fungal small molecules that function to maintain copper homeostasis. Discovery of copper binding small molecules produced by A. fumigatus gives insight into mechanisms other than the extensively studied copper transporters or metalloproteins for how fungi can regulate copper. This has important ecological implications as securing scarce nutrients is central for fitness and survival. Additionally, studying this mechanism in A. fumigatus provides a basis for investigation of copper regulation pathways in other fungi.","Raffa, N.; Won, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,132156,"Bioremediation Potential of Select Bacterial Species for the Neonicotinoid Insecticides, Thiamethoxam and Imidacloprid","The neonicotinoid insecticides, including thiamethoxam (THM) and imidacloprid (IMI), have become increasingly favored in the past decade due to their specificity as insect neurotoxicants. However, neonicotinoids have been implicated as a potential contributing factor in Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), the widespread disappearance of honey bees, which affects produce production on a global scale. The environmental persistence of neonicotinoids underscores the importance of developing a sustainable, ecologically-friendly remediation technique to remove residual insecticides from the environment. The present study characterizes the neonicotinoid bioremediation potential of six bacterial species: Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus lactis. In Phase I, we evaluated the utilization of IMI or THM as the sole carbon or nitrogen source by P. fluorescens, P. putida, and P. aeruginosa. All three species were better able to utilize THM over IMI as their sole carbon or nitrogen source, and better growth was noted when THM was used as the sole nitrogen source compared to the sole carbon source. Thus, further studies proceeded with THM only. In Phase II, we assessed the kinetics of THM removal from aqueous media by the six species. Significant (p<0.0001) reductions in 70 mg/L THM concentration were observed for P. fluorescens (67%), P. putida (65%), P. aeruginosa (52%), and A. faecalis (39%) over the 24-day study period, and for E. coli (60%) and S. lactis (12%) over the 14-day study period. The amount of time required to remove 50% of the THM in the media (T50) was: 12 days (d) (E. coli), 18 d (P. fluorescens), 19 d (P. putida), and 23 d (P. aeruginosa). Neither A. faecalis nor S. lactis achieved 50% removal during the study periods. The THM removal by all species followed a first-order kinetic reaction and half-lives were calculated accordingly. HPLC chromatograms of P. fluorescens, P. putida, and E. coli cultures revealed that as the area of the THM peak decreased over time, the area of an unidentified metabolite peak increased. In Phase II, we sought to characterize this metabolite and the overall metabolic efficiency of these three species. Maximal THM removal occurred at 30{degrees}C for all bacterial species assessed. Identification of the metabolite is currently underway, which will allow determination of whether the metabolite is less toxic than the parent compound, a prerequisite for this remediation technique to be viable. If the metabolite is found to be less hazardous than THM, further testing will follow to evaluate the use of this bioremediation technique in the field.","Zamule, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,132448,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa reverse diauxie is an optimized, resource utilization strategy","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a globally-distributed bacterium often found in medical infections. The opportunistic pathogen uses a different, carbon catabolite repression (CCR) strategy than many, model microorganisms. It does not utilize a classic diauxie phenotype, nor does it follow common systems biology assumptions including preferential consumption of glucose with an  overflow metabolism. Despite these contradictions, P. aeruginosa is competitive in many, disparate environments underscoring knowledge gaps in microbial ecology and systems biology. Physiological, omics, and in silico analyses were used to quantify the P. aeruginosa CCR strategy known as  reverse diauxie. An ecological basis of reverse diauxie was identified using a genome-scale, metabolic model interrogated with in vitro omics data. Reverse diauxie preference for lower energy, nonfermentable carbon sources, such as acetate or succinate over glucose, was predicted using a multidimensional strategy which minimized resource investment into central metabolism while completely oxidizing substrates. Application of a common, in silico optimization criterion, which maximizes growth rate, did not predict the reverse diauxie phenotypes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,132501,The PopN gate-keeper complex acts on the ATPase PscN to regulate the T3SS secretion switch from early to middle substrates in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacterium of which the main virulence factor is the Type III Secretion System. The ATPase of this machinery, PscN (SctN), is thought to be localized at the base of the secretion apparatus and to participate in the recognition, chaperone dissociation and unfolding of exported T3SS proteins. In this work, a protein-protein interaction ELISA revealed the interaction of PscN with a wide range of exported T3SS proteins including the needle, translocator, gate-keeper and effector. These interactions were further confirmed by Microscale Thermophoresis that also indicated a preferential interaction of PscN with secreted proteins or protein-chaperone complex rather than with chaperones alone, in line with the release of the chaperones in the bacterial cytoplasm after the dissociation from their exported proteins. Moreover, we suggest a new role of the gate-keeper complex and the ATPase in the regulation of early substrates recognition by the T3SS. This finding sheds a new light on the mechanism of secretion switching from early to middle substrates in P. aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,132610,Transcription inhibitors with XRE DNA-binding and cupin signal-sensing domains drive metabolic diversification in Pseudomonas,"Transcription factors (TFs) are instrumental in the bacterial response to new environmental conditions. They can act as direct signal sensors and subsequently induce changes in gene expression leading to physiological adaptation. Here, by combining RNA-seq and DAP-seq, we studied a family of eight TFs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This family, encompassing TFs with XRE-like DNA-binding and cupin signal-sensing domains, includes the metabolic regulators ErfA, PsdR and PauR and five so far unstudied TFs. The genome-wide delineation of their regulons identified 39 regulatory interactions with genes mostly involved in metabolism. We found that the XRE-cupin TFs are inhibitors of their neighboring genes, forming local, functional units encoding proteins with functions in condition-specific metabolic pathways. The phylogenetic analysis of this family of regulators across the Pseudomonas genus revealed a wide diversity of such metabolic regulatory modules and identified species with potentially higher metabolic versatility. Numerous uncharacterized XRE-cupin TFs were found near metabolism-related genes, illustrating the need of further systematic characterization of transcriptional regulatory networks in order to better understand the mechanisms of bacterial adaptation to new environments.

IMPORTANCEBacteria of the Pseudomonas genus, including the major human pathogen P. aeruginosa, are known for their complex regulatory networks and high number of transcription factors, which contribute to their impressive adaptive ability. However, even in the most studied species, most of the regulators are still uncharacterized. With the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing methods, it is now possible to fill this knowledge gap and help understanding how bacteria adapt and thrive in new environments. By leveraging these methods, we provide an example of a comprehensive analysis of an entire family of transcription factors and bring new insights into metabolic and regulatory adaptation in the Pseudomonas genus.","Trouillon, J.; Ragno, M.; Simon, V.; Attree, I.; Elsen, S.",2020-07-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.07.29.226225,1,Sylvie  Elsen,"Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS ERL5261, CEA IRIG-BCI, INSERM UMR1036, Grenoble, France",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.226225v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.226225v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1128/msystems.00753-20

Carbapenem classes of antibiotics are considered as the ""drugs of choice"" against A. baumannii infections, although increasing incidence of carbapenem resistant isolates have greatly limited their efficacy in clinical settings. Nonetheless, the phenomenon of multi-drug tolerance or persistence exhibited by A. baumannii has further led to therapeutic failure of carbapenems against chronic and recurring infections. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of persistence hosted by the nosocomial pathogen, A. baumannii can facilitate the development of effective anti-persister strategies against them. Accordingly, this study investigates the characteristics and mechanisms responsible for meropenem induced persistence in A. baumannii. Furthermore, it describes the adaptation of a screening strategy for identification of potent anti-persister compounds that cumulatively act by targeting the A. baumannii membrane, inhibiting antibiotic efflux and inducing oxidative stress mediated killing. The screen identified the phytochemical compound, thymol to display excellent activity against persisters of mechanically distinct antibiotics. While meropenem exposed A. baumannii persisters exhibited multi-drug tolerance and indicated the ability to enter a Viable But Non Culturable (VBNC) state, thymol efficiently eradicated all persister cells, irrespective of their culturability. Thymol exhibited no propensity for resistance generation and also inhibited persisters of other Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Collectively, our results establish thymol to have immense potential to act either alone or as an adjunct in combination therapies against persistent infections.

IMPORTANCEApart from the global catastrophe of antibiotic resistance, the phenomenon of ""antibiotic tolerance"" exhibited by a subpopulation of bacterial cells known as ""persisters"" ensue a major clinical threat. Eradication of the persister populations holds extreme importance for an improved long-term recovery from chronic and recurring bacterial infections. This study addresses the problem of antibiotic persistence prevailing in clinics and investigates its associated mechanisms in the nosocomial pathogen, Acinetobacter baumannii in reference to the antibiotic meropenem. It further describes the use of a mechanism-based screening approach for the identification of potent multi-targeting anti-persister compounds, thereby leading to the identification of GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) molecules exhibiting promising activity against A. baumannii persisters. This strategy can further be utilized for repurposing of FDA approved drugs or other available compound libraries, in order to identify novel anti-persister compounds.","Bhando, T.; Casius, A.; Uppalapati, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,133435,Real time monitoring of peptidoglycan synthesis by membrane-reconstituted penicillin binding proteins,"Peptidoglycan is an essential component of the bacterial cell envelope that surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane to protect the cell from osmotic lysis. Important antibiotics such as {beta}-lactams and glycopeptides target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Class A penicillin binding proteins are bifunctional membrane-bound peptidoglycan synthases that polymerize glycan chains and connect adjacent stem peptides by transpeptidation. How these enzymes work in their physiological membrane environment is poorly understood. Here we developed a novel FRET-based assay to follow in real time both reactions of class A PBPs reconstituted in liposomes or supported lipid bilayers and we demonstrate this assay with PBP1B homologues from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii in the presence or absence of their cognate lipoprotein activator. Our assay allows unravelling the mechanisms of peptidoglycan synthesis in a lipid-bilayer environment and can be further developed to be used for high throughput screening for new antimicrobials.","Vollmer, W.; Hernandez-Rocamora, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,133528,Developing Cyclic Peptomers as Broad-Spectrum Gram negative Bacterial Type III Secretion System Inhibitors,"Antibiotic resistant bacteria are an emerging global health threat. New antimicrobials are urgently needed. The injectisome type III secretion system (T3SS), required by dozens of Gram-negative bacteria for virulence but largely absent from non-pathogenic bacteria, is an attractive antimicrobial target. We previously identified synthetic cyclic peptomers, inspired by the natural product phepropeptin D, that inhibit protein secretion through the Yersinia Ysc and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Psc T3SSs, but do not inhibit bacterial growth. Here we describe identification of an isomer, 4EpDN, that is two-fold more potent (IC50 4 M) than its parental compound. Furthermore, 4EpDN inhibited the Yersinia Ysa and the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SSs, suggesting that this cyclic peptomer has broad efficacy against evolutionarily distant injectisome T3SSs. Indeed, 4EpDN strongly inhibited intracellular growth of Chlamydia trachomatis in HeLa cells, which requires the T3SS. 4EpDN did not inhibit the unrelated Twin arginine translocation (Tat) system, nor did it impact T3SS gene transcription. Moreover, although the injectisome and flagellar T3SSs are evolutionarily and structurally related, the 4EpDN cyclic peptomer did not inhibit secretion of substrates through the Salmonella flagellar T3SS, indicating that cyclic peptomers broadly but specifically target the injestisome T3SS. 4EpDN reduced the number of T3SS basal bodies detected on the surface of Y. enterocolitica, as visualized using a fluorescent derivative of YscD, an inner membrane ring with low homology to flagellar protein FliG. Collectively, these data suggest that cyclic peptomers specifically inhibit the injectisome T3SS from a variety of Gram-negative bacteria, possibly by preventing complete T3SS assembly.

IMPORTANCETraditional antibiotics target both pathogenic and commensal bacteria, resulting in a disruption of the microbiota, which in turn is tied to a number of acute and chronic diseases. The bacterial type III secretion system (T3SS) is an appendage used by many bacterial pathogens to establish infection, but is largely absent from commensal members of the microbiota. In this study, we identify a new derivative of the cyclic peptomer class of T3SS inhibitors. These compounds inhibit the T3SS of the nosocomial ESKAPE pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enteropathogenic Yersinia and Salmonella. The impact of cyclic peptomers is specific to the T3SS, as other bacterial secretory systems are unaffected. Importantly, cyclic peptomers completely block replication of Chlamydia trachomatis, the causative agent of genital, eye, and lung infections, in human cells, a process that requires the T3SS. Therefore, cyclic peptomers represent promising virulence blockers that can specifically disarm a broad spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens.","Lam, H.; Lau, T.; Lentz, A.; Sherry, J.; Cabrera-Cortez, A.; Hug, K.; Engel, J.; Lokey, S.; Auerbach Stone, V.",2020-08-04,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.08.03.235622,1,Hanh  Lam,"University of California, Santa Cruz",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.235622v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.235622v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/AAC.01690-20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,133938,Heterogenous susceptibility to R-pyocin killing in populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sourced from cystic fibrosis lungs,"Bacteriocins are proteinaceous antimicrobials produced by bacteria which are active against other strains of the same species. R-type pyocins are phage tail-like bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Due to their anti-pseudomonal activity, R-pyocins have potential as therapeutics in infection. P. aeruginosa is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen and is particularly problematic for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). P. aeruginosa from CF lung infections develop increasing resistance to antibiotics, making new treatment approaches essential. P. aeruginosa populations become phenotypically and genotypically diverse during infection, however, little is known of the efficacy of R-pyocins against heterogeneous populations. R-pyocins vary by subtype (R1-R5), distinguished by binding to different residues on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Each type varies in killing spectrum, and each strain produces only one R-type. To evaluate the prevalence of different R-types, we screened P. aeruginosa strains from the International Pseudomonas Consortium Database (IPCD) and from our biobank of CF strains. We found that (i) R1-types were the most prevalent R-type among strains from respiratory sources; (ii) there is a large number of strains lacking R-pyocin genes, and (iii) isolates collected from the same patient have the same R-type. We then assessed the impact of intra-strain diversity on R-pyocin susceptibility and found a heterogenous response to R-pyocins within populations, likely due to differences in the LPS core. Our work reveals that heterogeneous populations of microbes exhibit variable susceptibility to R-pyocins and highlights that there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, including phage.

ImportanceR-pyocins have potential as alternative therapeutics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic infection, however little is known about the efficacy of R-pyocins in heterogeneous bacterial populations. P. aeruginosa is known to become resistant to multiple antibiotics, as well as evolve phenotypic and genotypic diversity over time; thus it is particularly difficult to eradicate in chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa populations from CF lungs maintain the same R-pyocin genotype but exhibit heterogeneity in susceptibility to R-pyocins from other strains. Our findings suggest there is likely heterogeneity in response to other types of LPS-binding antimicrobials, such as phage, highlighting the necessity of further studying the potential of LPS-binding antimicrobial particles as alternative therapies in chronic infections.","Mei, M.; Thomas, J.; Diggle, S.

Specification and modification of the isolates discovered at genomic and transcriptomic levels with aligned phenotypic observations indicated that these isolates formed excessive biofilm with elevated quorum sensing systems.,"Qu, J.-X.; Cai, Z.; Liu, Y.; Duan, X.; Han, S.; Zhu, Y.; Jiang, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Zhuo, C.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Liu, L.; Yang, L.",2020-08-06,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.08.05.238998,1,Liang  Yang,"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.238998v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.05.238998v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.3389/fcimb.2021.641920
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,134395,Rapid evolution drives the rise and fall of carbapenem resistance during an acute Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"It is well established that antibiotic treatment selects for resistance in pathogenic bacteria. However, the evolutionary responses of pathogen populations to antibiotic treatment during infections remain poorly resolved, especially in acute infections. Here we map the evolutionary responses to treatment in high definition through genomic and phenotypic characterization of >100 isolates from a patient with P. aeruginosa pneumonia. Antibiotic therapy (meropenem, colistin) caused a rapid crash of the P. aeruginosa population in the lung, but this decline was followed by the spread of meropenem resistance mutations that restrict antibiotic uptake (oprD) or modify LPS biosynthesis (wbpM). Low fitness strains with high-level meropenem resistance (oprD) were then replaced by high fitness strains with  anti-resistance mutations in the MexAB-OprM efflux pump, causing a rapid decline in resistance to both meropenem and a collateral loss of resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. In contrast, we did not observe any evolutionary responses to antibiotic treatment in the intestinal population of P. aeruginosa. Carbapenem antibiotics are key to the treatment of infections caused by Gram negative pathogens, and our work highlights the ability of natural selection to drive both the rapid rise and fall of carbapenem resistance during acute infections.","Wheatley, R.; Diaz Caballero, J.; Kapel, N.; Quinn, A.; Del Barrio-Tofino, E.; Lopez-Causape, C.; Hedge, J.; Torrens, G.; Van Der Schalk, T.; Britto Xavier, B.; Fernandez-Cuenca, F.; Arenzana, A.; Recanatini, C.; Timbermont, L.; Sifakis, F.; Ruzin, A.; Ali, O.; Lammens, C.; Goossens, H.; Kluytmans, J.; Kumar-Singh, S.; Oliver, A.; Malhotra-Kumar, S.; Maclean, C.",2020-08-10,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2020.08.10.243741,1,Craig  Maclean,University of Oxford,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.243741v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.10.243741v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41467-021-22814-9
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,135393,The anti-sigma factor MucA is required for viability in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"During decades-long infections in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes selection. One bacterial genetic adaptation often observed in CF isolates is mucA mutations. MucA inhibits the sigma factor AlgU. Mutations in mucA lead to AlgU misregulation, resulting in a mucoid phenotype that is associated with poor CF disease outcomes. Due to its ability to be mutated, mucA is assumed to be dispensable for bacterial viability. Here we show that, paradoxically, a portion of mucA is essential in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that mucA is no longer required in a strain lacking algU, that mucA alleles encoding for proteins that do not bind to AlgU are insufficient for viability, and that mucA is no longer essential in mutant strains containing AlgU variants with reduced sigma factor activity. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of algU prevents cell growth in the absence of MucA, and that this phenotype can be rescued by overproduction of RpoD, the housekeeping sigma factor. Together, these results suggest that in the absence of MucA, the inability to regulate AlgU activity results in the loss of bacterial viability. Finally, we speculate that essentiality of anti-sigma factors that regulate envelope function may be a widespread phenomenon in bacteria.","Schofield, M. C.; Rodriguez, D.; Kidman, A. A.; Cassin, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,135557,A novel copper-sensing two-component system for activating Dsb genes in bacteria,"Copper is an essential element for biological systems but becomes toxic when present in excess. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen, the resistance to copper requires the induction of dsbDEG operon encoding proteins involved in disulfide-bond formation (Dsb). However, it is unknown how the copper stress induces the transcription of the operon. Here, we report that the exogenous copper induces the transcription of the dsbDEG operon through a new copper-sensing two-component system named DsbRS. The dsbRS is divergently transcribed from the dsbDEG operon, and the response regulator DsbR binds to the intergenic region between the operons. In the absence of copper, the sensor kinase DsbS acts as a phosphatase toward DsbR and thus blocks the transcription of the operons. However, in the presence of copper, the metal ion directly binds to the sensor domain of DsbS, for which the Cys82 residue plays a critical role. The copper-binding appears to inhibit the phosphatase activity of DsbS, leading to activation of DsbR. The copper resistance of the dsbRS knock-out mutant was restored by ectopic expression of the dsbDEG operon, confirming the critical role of the operon in the resistance to copper. Strikingly, cognates of dsbRS-dsbDEG pair are widely distributed across eubacteria. Also, a DsbR-binding site, which contains the consensus sequence 5-TAA-N7-TTAAT-3, is detected in the promoter region of dsbDEG homologs in those species. Thus, regulation of Dsb genes by DsbRS represents a novel mechanism by which bacterial cells cope with copper stress.

ImportanceCopper is an essential redox active cofactor that becomes highly cytotoxic when present in excess. Therefore, in order to evade copper toxicity, bacteria must perceive copper stress and tightly regulate genes expression. In the present study, we identify a new copper-sensing two-component system (designated DsbRS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen. We provide multiple lines of evidence that upon copper binding to the periplasmic domain of DsbS, its phosphatase activity is blocked, and the phosphorylated DsbR directly activates the transcription of a number of copper-induced genes including those involved in protein disulfide-bond formation (Dsb). This study suggests that regulation of Dsb genes by DsbRS may be an underappreciated regulatory mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to copper.","Yu, L.; Cao, Q.; Chen, W.; Yang, N.; Yang, C.-G.; Ji, Q.; Wu, M.; Bae, T.; Lan, L.",2020-08-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.08.17.255257,1,Lefu  Lan,Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.255257v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.17.255257v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.scib.2021.03.003
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,135562,Bacterial behavior in human blood reveals complement evaders with persister-like features,"AbstractsBacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are a major health concern and can cause up to 40% mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI is often of nosocomial origin and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. The mechanism of bacterial persistence in blood is still largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the behavior of a cohort of clinical and laboratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in human blood. In this specific environment, complement was the main defensive mechanism, acting either by direct bacterial lysis or by opsonophagocytosis, which required recognition by immune cells. We found highly variable survival rates for different strains in blood, whatever their origin, serotype, or the nature of their secreted toxins and despite their detection by immune cells. We identified and characterized a complement-tolerant subpopulation of bacterial cells that we named ""evaders"". Evaders represented 0.1-0.001% of the initial bacterial load and displayed transient tolerance. Although evaders shared some features with bacterial persisters, which tolerate antibiotic treatment, they appear to have evolved distinct strategies to escape complement. We detected the evaders for five other major human pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia multivorans, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Thus, the evaders could allow the pathogen to persist within the bloodstream, and may be the cause of fatal bacteremia or dissemination, notably in the absence of effective antibiotic treatments.

Author summary for ""Complement evaders""Blood infections by antibiotic resistant bacteria, notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are major concerns in hospital settings. The complex interplay between P. aeruginosa and the innate immune system in the context of human blood is still poorly understood. By studying the behavior of various P. aeruginosa strains in human whole blood and plasma, we showed that bacterial strains display different rate of tolerance to the complement system. Despite the complement microbicide activity, most bacteria withstand elimination through phenotypic heterogeneity creating a tiny (<0.1%) subpopulation of transiently tolerant evaders. While genetically identical to the rest of the complement-sensitive population, evaders allow the bacteria to persist in plasma. This phenotypic heterogeneity thus prevents total elimination of the pathogen from the circulation, and represent a new strategy to disseminate within the organism.","Pont, S.; Fraikin, N.; Caspar, Y.; Van Melderen, L.; Attree, I.; Cretin, F.",2020-08-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.08.18.255448,1,Ina  Attree,"Universite Grenoble Alpes Grenoble, CNRS",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255448v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.255448v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008893
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,136398,Flagellin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa modulates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in CF airway epithelial cells by increasing TMPRSS2 expression,"The major challenge of the COVID-19 health crisis is to identify the factors of susceptibility to SARS-Cov2 in order to adapt the recommendations to the populations and to reduce the risk of getting COVID-19 to the most vulnerable people especially those having chronic respiratory diseases including cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway epithelial cells (AEC) are playing a critical role in the immune response and in COVID-19 severity. SARS-CoV-2 infects the airways through ACE2 receptor and the host protease TMPRSS2 was shown to play a major role in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Here, we show that the main component of P. aeruginosa flagella, ie. flagellin is able to increase TMPRSS2 expression in AEC, and even more in those deficient for CFTR. Importantly, this increased TMPRSS2 expression is associated with an increase in the level of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Considering the urgency of the health situation, this result is of major significance for patients with CF which are frequently infected and colonized by P. aeruginosa during the course of the disease.","Ruffin, M.; Bigot, J.; Calmel, C.; Mercier, J.; Pizzorno, A.; Rosa-Calatrava, M.; Corvol, H.; Balloy, V.; Terrier, O.; Guillot, L.",2020-11-06,Pathology,10.1101/2020.08.24.264564,2,Loic  Guillot,Inserm,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.264564v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,136503,Global identification of RsmA/N binding sites in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by in vivo UV CLIP-seq,"Posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression in bacteria is performed by a complex and hierarchical signaling cascade. Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbors two redundant RNA-binding proteins RsmA/RsmN (RsmA/N), which play a critical role in balancing acute and chronic infections. However, in vivo binding sites on target transcripts and the overall impact on the physiology remains unclear. In this study, we applied in vivo UV crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by RNA-sequencing (UV CLIP-seq) to detect RsmA/N binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution and mapped more than 500 peaks to approximately 400 genes directly bound by RsmA/N in P. aeruginosa. This also demonstrated the ANGGA sequence in apical loops skewed towards 5UTRs as a consensus motif for RsmA/N binding. Genetic analysis combined with CLIP-seq results identified previously unrecognized RsmA/N targets involved in LPS modification. Moreover, the small non-coding RNAs RsmY/RsmZ, which sequester RsmA/N away from target mRNAs, are positively regulated by the RsmA/N-mediated translational repression of hptB, encoding a histidine phosphotransfer protein, and cafA, encoding a cytoplasmic axial filament protein, thus providing a possible mechanistic explanation for homeostasis of the Rsm system. Our findings present the global RsmA/N-RNA interaction network that exerts pleiotropic effects on gene expression in P. aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEThe ubiquitous bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is notorious as an opportunistic pathogen causing life-threatening acute and chronic infections in immunocompromised patients. P. aeruginosa infection processes are governed by two major gene regulatory systems, namely, the GacA/GacS (GacAS) two-component system and the RNA-binding proteins RsmA/RsmN (RsmA/N). RsmA/N basically function as a translational repressor or activator directly by competing with the ribosome. In this study, we identified hundreds of RsmA/N regulatory target RNAs and the consensus motifs for RsmA/N bindings by UV crosslinking in vivo. Moreover, our CLIP-seq revealed that RsmA/N posttranscriptionally regulate cell wall organization and exert feedback control on GacAS-RsmA/N systems. Many genes including small regulatory RNAs identified in this study are attractive targets for further elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of RsmA/N in P. aeruginosa.","Chihara, K.; Barquist, L.; Takasugi, K.; Noda, N.; Tsuneda, S.",2020-08-25,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.08.24.265819,1,Satoshi  Tsuneda,Waseda University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265819v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.24.265819v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1080/15476286.2021.1917184
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,136549,Effect of host-mimicking medium and biofilm growth on the ability of colistin to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"In vivo biofilms cause recalcitrant infections with extensive and unpredictable antibiotic tolerance. Here, we demonstrate increased tolerance of colistin by Pseudomonas aeruginosa when grown in cystic fibrosis-mimicking medium versus standard medium in in vitro biofilm assays, and drastically increased tolerance when grown in an ex vivo CF model versus the in vitro assay. We used colistin conjugated to the fluorescent dye BODIPY to assess the penetration of the antibiotic into ex vivo biofilms and showed that poor penetration partly explains the high doses of drug necessary to kill bacteria in these biofilms. The ability of antibiotics to penetrate the biofilm matrix is key to their clinical success, but hard to measure. Our results demonstrate both the importance of reduced entry into the matrix in in vivo-like biofilm, and the tractability of using a fluorescent tag and benchtop fluorimeter to assess antibiotic entry into biofilms. This method could be a relatively quick, cheap and useful addition to diagnostic and R&D pipelines, allowing the assessment of drug entry into biofilms, in in vivo-like conditions, prior to more detailed tests of biofilm killing.","Sweeney, E.; Sabnis, A.; Edwards, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,136747,An inside look at a biofilm: Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagella bio-tracking,"The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a flagellated bacterium, is one of the top model organisms for studying biofilm formation. In order to elucidate the role of the bacteria flagella in biofilm formation, we developed a new tool for flagella bio-tracking. We have site-specifically labeled the bacterial flagella by incorporating an unnatural amino acid into the flagella monomer via genetic code expansion. This enabled us to label and track the bacterial flagella during biofilm maturation. Direct, live imaging revealed for the first-time presence and synthesis of flagella throughout the biofilm lifecycle. To ascertain the possible role of the flagella in the strength of a biofilm we produced a ""flagella knockout"" strain and compared its biofilm to that of the wild type strain. Results showed a one order of magnitude stronger biofilm structure in the wild type in comparison to the flagella knockout strain.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,136907,Presence of the Hmq system and production of 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkylquinolines is heterogeneously distributed between Burkholderia cepacia complex species and more prevalent among environmental than clinical isolates,"Some Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) strains have been reported to produce 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-alkylquinolines (HMAQs), analogous to the 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using in silico analyses, we previously showed that the hmqABCDEFG operon, which encodes enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HMAQs, is carried by about one-third of Bcc strains, with considerable inter- and intra-species variability. In the present study, we investigated by PCR, using consensus primers, the distribution of hmqABCDEFG in a collection of 313 Bcc strains (222 of clinical and 91 of environmental origins) - belonging to 18 Bcc species. We confirmed that the distribution is species-specific, although not all strains within a species carry the hmqABCDEFG operon. Among the 30% of strains bearing the hmqABCDEFG operon, we measured the total HMAQs production and showed that 90% of environmental isolates and 68% of clinically isolated Bcc produce detectable levels of HMAQs when cultured in TSB medium. For the strains having the hmqABCDEFG operon but not producing HMAQs, we studied the transcription and showed that none expressed the hmqA gene under the specified culture conditions. Interestingly, the hmqABCDEFG operon is more prevalent among plant root environment species (e.g. B. ambifaria, B. cepacia) and absent in species commonly found in chronically colonized individuals with cystic fibrosis (e.g. B. cenocepacia, B. multivorans), suggesting that the Hmq system could play a role in niche adaptation by influencing rhizosphere microbial community and could have been lost through evolution. Understanding the Hmq system and its regulation will provide clues concerning the production of HMAQs and their functions in Bcc.","Coulon, P. M. L.; Zlosnik, J. E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,137266,The Impact of Pf Bacteriophages on the Fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa; A Mathematical Modeling Approach,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is a major bacterial pathogen responsible for chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. Recent work by ourselves and others has implicated Pf bacteriophages, non-lytic filamentous viruses produced by Pa, in the chronicity and severity of Pa infections. Pf phages act as structural elements in Pa biofilms and sequester aerosolized antibiotics, thereby contributing to antibiotic tolerance. Consistent with a selective advantage in this setting, the prevalence of Pf+ bacteria increases over time in these patients. However, the production of Pf phages comes at a metabolic cost to bacteria, such that Pf+ strains grow more slowly than Pf- strains in vitro. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate how these competing pressures might influence the relative abundance of Pf+ versus Pf- strains in different settings. Our model predicts that Pf+ strains of Pa can only outcompete Pf- strains if the benefits of phage production falls solely onto Pf+ strains and not onto the overall bacterial community in the lung. Further, phage production only leads to a net positive gain in fitness at antibiotic concentrations slightly above the minimum inhibitory concentration (i.e., concentrations for which the benefits of antibiotic sequestration outweigh the metabolic cost of phage production), but which are not lethal for Pf+ strains. As a result, our model predicts that frequent administration of intermediate doses of antibiotics with low decay rates favors Pf+ over Pf- strains. These models inform our understanding of the ecology of Pf phages and suggest potential treatment strategies for Pf+ Pa infections.

ImportanceFilamentous phages are a frontier in bacterial pathogenesis, but the impact of these phages on bacterial fitness is unclear. In particular, Pf phages produced by Pa promote antibiotic tolerance but are metabolically expensive to produce, suggesting that competing pressures may influence the prevalence of Pf+ versus Pf- strains of Pa in different settings. Our results identify conditions likely to favor Pf+ strains and thus antibiotic tolerance. This study contributes to a better understanding of the unique ecology of filamentous phages and may facilitate improved treatment strategies for combating antibiotic tolerance.","Pourtois, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,137943,Evolution and regulation of microbial secondary metabolism,"Microbes have disproportionate impacts on the macroscopic world. This is in part due to their ability to grow to large groups and cooperatively secrete massive amounts of secondary metabolites that impact their environment. Yet, the conditions enabling secondary metabolism without compromising primary needs remain unclear. Here we investigated the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids, a secondary metabolite that Pseudomonas aeruginosa makes to decrease the surface tension of surrounding liquid. Using a combination of genomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, and mathematical modeling we show that biosynthesis of rhamnolipids from glycerol varies inconsistently across the phylogenetic tree; instead, non-producer lineages are also those worse at reducing the oxidative stress of primary glycerol metabolism. The link to oxidative stress explains the inconsistent distribution across the P. aeruginosa tree, adding a new layer to the regulation of rhamnolipids--a microbial secondary metabolite important for fitness in natural and clinical settings.

SignificanceThe bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major source of hospital-acquired infections. This pathogens knack for virulence relies on its ability to multiply and secrete massive amounts of substances that overwhelm microbial competitors and weaken host defenses. It remains unclear how the bacteria conciliate their need to grow and multiply--a need at the individual-level-- with their ability to secrete products--a need of the population. Here we combined genomics, metabolomics and mathematical modeling to study the biosynthesis of rhamnolipids, a surfactant that P. aeruginosa makes to reduce the surface tension of surrounding liquids. Our study reveals a new link between oxidative stress and rhamnolipid synthesis, which helps explain how this important bacterial product has evolved and how it persists in many lineages of pathogens.","Santamaria, G.; Liao, C.; Wang, Z.; Rhee, K.; Pinto, F.; Yan, J.; Xavier, J.",2021-10-29,Systems Biology,10.1101/2020.09.02.280495,2,Jinyuan  Yan,"Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.280495v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.02.280495v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,138705,Pseudomonas aeruginosa induced acute emphysema through bacterial secretion in mice,"Pulmonary emphysema is the major pathological feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the pathogenesis of emphysema is still not completely understood, but until now a bacterial cause has not really been considered. Recently, we found that the secretion from Pseudomonas aeruginosa could cause severe lung emphysema in mice rapidly. Since the bacterium is ubiquitous and secrets proteases, we hypothesized that direct P. aeruginosa airway infection would have a similar effect. To address this issue, we applied a unilateral lung injury model. First, we observed the dynamic pathophysiology change of acute emphysema. P. aeruginosa secretion was extracted and instilled intratracheally into the left lungs of C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice, while the right lungs were saved as self-control. Alveolar diameter and lung compliance were measured. Later, we tested the effect of P. aeruginosa inoculation in normal C57BL/6 mice, immunosuppressed C57BL/6 mice, and C3H/HeJ (TLR4 deficient) mice. P. aeruginosa secretion extract caused acute panacinar emphysema and decreased dynamic lung compliance. Different types of emphysema are transformable. However, the P. aeruginosa infection could only elicit emphysema in immunosuppressed C57BL/6 mice and C3H/HeJ mice, indicating that normal immunity is essential to protect the hosts from emphysema. Emphysema induced by P. aeruginosa in mice recapitulates all the main features of human emphysema and COPD. Our finding filled a major gap in COPD pathogenesis. We believe P. aeruginosa is the underlying cause of COPD.","Zhu, Y.; Pan, S.",2020-09-18,Pathology,10.1101/2020.09.08.287003,3,Shuming  Pan,Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Xinhua Hospital,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287003v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.08.287003v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,139064,Microbial colonization induces histone acetylation critical for inherited gut-germline-neural signaling,"The gut-neural axis plays a critical role in the control of several physiological processes, including the communication of signals from the microbiome to the nervous system, which affects learning, memory, and behavior. However, the pathways involved in gut-neural signaling of gut-governed behaviors remain unclear. We found that the intestinal distension caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces histone H4 Lys8 acetylation (H4K8ac) in the germline of Caenorhabditis elegans, which is required for both a bacterial aversion behavior and its transmission to the next generation. We show that induction of H4K8ac in the germline is essential for bacterial aversion and that a 14-3-3 chaperone protein family member, PAR-5, is required for H4K8ac. Our findings highlight a role for H4K8ac in the germline not only in the intergenerational transmission of pathogen avoidance but also in the transmission of pathogenic cues that travel through the gut-neural axis to control the aversive behavior.","Hong, C.; Lalsiamthara, J.; Ren, J.; Sang, Y.; Aballay, A.",2021-02-24,Immunology,10.1101/2020.09.10.291823,2,Alejandro  Aballay,Oregon Health & Science University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.291823v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.10.291823v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.pbio.3001169
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,139206,NHR-49 acts in distinct tissues to promote longevity versus innate immunity,"Aging and immunity are inextricably linked and many genes that extend lifespan also enhance immunoresistance. However, it remains unclear if longevity-enhancing factors modulate immunity and longevity by distinct or shared mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans pro-longevity factor, NHR-49, also promotes resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but modulates immunity and longevity by spatially and mechanistically distinct mechanisms. Fenofibrate, an agonist of NHR-49s mammalian functional homolog, PPAR, enhanced worm immunoresistance in an NHR-49-dependent manner. NHR-49 expression is increased by germline ablation, an intervention that extends lifespan, but lowered by pathogen exposure. NHR-49 acted in multiple somatic tissues to promote longevity, whereas, its pro-immunity function was mediated by neuronal expression. The canonical NHR-49 target genes, acs-2 and fmo-2, were upregulated by germline loss, but infection triggered fmo-2 downregulation and acs-2 upregulation. Interestingly, neither gene conferred resistance against Gram-negative Pseudomonas, unlike their reported roles in immunity against Gram-positive pathogens. Thus, NHR-49 is differentially regulated by interventions that bring about long-term changes (lifespan extension) vs. short-term stress (pathogen exposure) and in response it orchestrates distinct outputs, including pathogen-specific transcriptional programs. Overall, our study demonstrates the independent control of immunity and longevity by a conserved regulatory protein.","Naim, N.; Amrit, F. R.; Ratnappan, R.; Delbuono, N.; Loose, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,140102,"PEA polymer-coated nanotopography delivers solid-state BMP2, enhances mesenchymal stem cell adhesion, prevents bacterial biofilm formation and protects cells from quorum sensing virulence factors","Post-operative infection is a major complication in patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery. As such, there is a clinical need to develop biomaterials for use in regenerative surgery that can promote mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) osteospecific differentiation and that can prevent infection caused by biofilm-forming pathogens. Nanotopographical approaches to pathogen control are being identified, including in orthopaedic materials such as titanium and its alloys. These topographies use high aspect ratio nanospikes or nanowires to prevent bacterial adhesion but these features puncture adhering cells, thus also reducing MSC adhesion. Here, we use a poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) polymer coating on titanium nanowires to spontaneously organise fibronectin (FN) and to deliver bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to enhance MSC adhesion and osteospecific signalling. This nanotopography when combined with the PEA coating enhanced osteogenesis and reduced adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in culture. Using a novel MSC-Pseudomonas aeruginosa co-culture, we also show that the coated nanotopographies protect MSCs from cytotoxic quorum sensing and signalling molecules. We conclude that the PEA polymer-coated nanotopography can both support MSCs and prevent pathogens from adhering to a biomaterial surface, thus protecting from biofilm formation and bacterial infection and supporting osteogenic repair.","Damiati, L.; Tsimbouri, M.; Ginty, M.; Llopis-Hernandez, V.; Childs, P.; Jayawarna, V.; Xiao, Y.; Burgess, K.; Wells, J.; Sprott, M.; Meek, D.; Li, P.; Oreffo, R.; Nobbs, A.; Ramage, G.; Su, B.; Salmeron-Sanchez, M.; Dalby, M.",2020-09-20,Bioengineering,10.1101/2020.09.17.302455,2,Matthew  Dalby,University of Glasgow,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.302455v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.17.302455v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,140175,CRISPR-Cas systems restrict horizontal gene transfer in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with an adaptive immune system that targets foreign DNA. However, the xenogenic nature of immunity provided by CRISPR-Cas raises the possibility that these systems may constrain horizontal gene transfer. Here we test this hypothesis in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has emerged an important model system for understanding CRISPR-Cas function. Across the diversity of P. aeruginosa, active CRISPR-Cas systems are associated with smaller genomes and a reduced GC content, suggesting that CRISPR-Cas inhibits the acquisition of foreign DNA. Although phage are the major target of CRISPR-Cas spacers, more than 80% of isolates with an active CRISPR-Cas system have spacers that target integrative conjugative elements (ICE) or the conserved conjugative transfer machinery used by plasmids and ICE. Consistent with these results, genomes containing active CRISPR-Cas systems harbor a lower abundance of both prophage and ICE. Crucially, spacers in genomes with active CRISPR-Cas systems map to ICE and phage that are integrated into the chromosomes of closely related genomes lacking CRISPR-Cas immunity, providing direct evidence that CRISPR-Cas constrains horizontal gene transfer in these lineages. In conclusion, we find that CRISPR-Cas acts as an important constraint to horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that CRISPR-Cas may constrain the ability of this pathogen to adapt to new niches and stressors.","Wheatley, R.; Maclean, C.",2020-09-19,Genomics,10.1101/2020.09.19.304717,1,Rachel  Wheatley,University of Oxford,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.304717v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.19.304717v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41396-020-00860-3
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,140864,The rise and the fall of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic lineage in a hospital,"The biological features that allow a pathogen to survive in the hospital environment are mostly unknown. The extinction of bacterial epidemics in hospitals is mostly attributed to changes in medical practice, including infection control, but the role of bacterial adaptation has never been documented. We analyzed a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates belonging to the Besancon Epidemic Strain (BES), responsible for a 12-year nosocomial outbreak, using a genotype-to-phenotype approach. Bayesian analysis estimated the emergence of the clone in the hospital five years before its opening, during the creation of its water distribution network made of copper. BES survived better than the reference strains PAO1 and PA14 in a copper solution due to a genomic island containing 13 metal-resistance genes and was specifically able to proliferate in the ubiquitous amoeba Vermamoeba vermiformis. Mutations affecting amino-acid metabolism, antibiotic resistance, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and regulation were enriched during the spread of BES. Seven distinct regulatory mutations attenuated the overexpression of the genes encoding the efflux pump MexAB-OprM over time. The fitness of BES decreased over time in correlation with its genome size. Overall, the resistance to inhibitors and predators presumably aided the proliferation and propagation of BES in the plumbing system of the hospital. The pathogen further spread among patients via multiple routes of contamination. The decreased prevalence of patients infected by BES mirrored the parallel and convergent genomic evolution and reduction that affected bacterial fitness. Along with infection control measures, this may have participated in the extinction of BES in the hospital setting.

ImportanceBacterial pathogens are responsible for nosocomial outbreaks, but the sources of contamination of the hospitals are mostly unclear and the role of bacterial evolution in the extinction of outbreaks has never been considered. Here, we found that an epidemic strain of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa contaminated the drinking water network of a hospital due to its tolerance to copper and predatory amoeba, both present in the water pipes. The extinction of the outbreak occurred concomitantly with parallel and convergent genome evolution and a reduction in the size of the bacterial genome that correlated with the fitness of the pathogen. Our data suggest that pathogen evolution participated in the extinction of an outbreak in a hospital setting.","Petitjean, M.; Juarez, P.; Meunier, A.; Daguindau, E.; Puja, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,140609,The Structures of SctK and SctD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Reveal the Interface of the Type III Secretion System Basal Body and Sorting Platform,"Many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens use type III secretion systems (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to subvert normal cellular functions. The T3SS apparatus (injectisome) shares a common overall architecture in all systems studied thus far, comprising three major components - the cytoplasmic sorting platform, the envelope-spanning basal body and the external needle with controlling tip complex. The sorting platform consists of an ATPase (SctN) connected to ""pods"" (SctQ) having six-fold symmetry via radial spokes (SctL). These pods interface with the 24-fold symmetric SctD inner membrane ring (IR) via an adaptor protein (SctK). Here we report the first high-resolution structure of a SctK protein family member, PscK from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as the structure of its interacting partner, the cytoplasmic domain of PscD (SctD). The cytoplasmic domain of PscD forms a forkhead-associated (FHA) fold, like that of its homologues from other T3SS. PscK, on the other hand, forms a helix-rich structure that does not resemble any known protein fold. Based on these structural findings, we present the first model for an interaction between proteins from the sorting platform and the IR. We also test the importance of the PscD residues predicted to mediate this electrostatic interaction using a two-hybrid analysis. The functional need for Arg96 in vivo was then confirmed by monitoring secretion of the effector ExoU. These structures will contribute to the development of atomic-resolution models of the entire sorting platform and to our understanding of the mechanistic interface between the sorting platform and the basal body of the injectisome.

The first reported structure for a T3SS SctK protein family member was solved for PscK from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and this allowed for modeling of the interface between this sorting platform protein and the cytoplasmic domain of PscD (a SctD protein family member). This allowed for identification of amino acid residues that may play a role in the interaction between these proteins. The interface appears to be dominated by electrostatic interactions and mutagenesis confirmed the importance of key residues in driving their interaction based on two-hybrid analysis.

Moreover, TAT-RasGAP317-326 limits the expansion of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa established biofilms at concentrations 2-4 times superior to the MIC.

Here, we used fluorescent fusion proteins to study the localization of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system native to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When targeted to an integrated prophage, the crRNA-guided (Csy) complex and a majority of Cas3 molecules in the cell are recruited to a single focus. When lacking a target in the cell, however, the Csy complex is broadly nucleoid bound, while Cas3 is diffuse in the cytoplasm. Nucleoid association for the Csy proteins is crRNA-dependent, and inhibited by expression of anti-CRISPR AcrIF2, which blocks PAM binding. The Cas9 nuclease is also nucleoid localized, only when gRNA-bound, which is abolished by PAM mimic, AcrIIA4. Our findings reveal PAM-dependent nucleoid surveillance and spatiotemporal regulation in Type I CRISPR-Cas that separates the nuclease-helicase Cas3 from the crRNA-guided surveillance complex.","Govindarajan, S.; Borges, A.; Bondy-Denomy, J.",2020-10-19,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.09.29.318501,3,Joseph  Bondy-Denomy,UCSF,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.318501v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.318501v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/jb.00105-22

TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a recently described AMP effective against a broad range of bacteria, but little is known about the conditions that may influence its activity. Using RNA-sequencing and screening of mutant libraries, we show that Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respond to TAT-RasGAP317-326 by regulating metabolic and stress response pathways, possibly implicating two-component systems. Our results also indicate that bacterial surface properties, in particular integrity of the lipopolysaccharide layer, influence peptide binding and entry. Finally, we found differences between bacterial species with respect to their rate of resistance emergence against this peptide.

Kaposis sarcoma (KS), a hyperproliferative and inflammatory tumor caused by Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, is the most common cancer in AIDS patients. KSHV infection sensitizes cells to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). We examined the role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), an opportunistic bacterium that can affect AIDS patients, in inflammation and cell proliferation of KSHV-transformed cells. PA stimulation increased cell proliferation and efficiency of colony formation in softagar of KSHV-transformed rat primary mesenchymal precursor (KMM) cells but had no significant effect on the untransformed (MM) cells. PA stimulation also increased cell proliferation of KSHV-infected human B-cells, Bjab, but not the uninfected cells. Mechanistically, PA stimulation resulted in increased inflammatory cytokines and activation of p38, ERK1/2, and JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in KMM cells while having no obvious effect on MM cells. PA induction of inflammation and MAPKs were observed with and without inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway while a flagellin-deleted mutant of PA required a functional TLR4 pathway to induce inflammation and MAPKs. Furthermore, treatment with both LPS or flagellin alone was sufficient to induce inflammatory cytokines, activate MAPKs, and increase cell proliferation and efficiency of colony formation in softagar of KMM cells. These results demonstrate that both LPS and flagellin are PAMPs that contribute to PA induction of inflammation in KSHV-transformed cells. Because AIDS-KS patients are susceptible to PA infection, our work highlights the preventive and therapeutic potential of targeting PA infection in these patients.

ImportanceKaposis sarcoma (KS), caused by infection of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is one of the most common cancers in AIDS patients. KS is a highly inflammatory tumor but how KSHV infection induces inflammation remains unclear. We have previously shown that KSHV infection upregulates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), sensitizing cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Escherichia coli. In the current study, we examined the role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), an opportunistic bacterium that can affect AIDS patients, in inflammation and cell proliferation of KSHV-transformed cells. PA stimulation increased cell proliferation, inflammatory cytokines, and activation of growth and survival pathways in KSHV-transformed cells through two pathogen-associated molecular patterns LPS and flagellin. Because AIDS-KS patients are susceptible to PA infection, our work highlights the preventive and therapeutic potential of targeting PA infection in these patients.","Markazi, A.; Bracci, P.; Mcgrath, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,143405,A parental transcriptional response to microsporidia infection induces inherited immunity in offspring,"Inherited immunity is an emerging field and describes how the transfer of immunity from parents to offspring can promote progeny survival in the face of infection. The mechanisms of how inherited immunity is induced are mostly unknown. The intracellular parasite Nematocida parisii is a natural microsporidian pathogen of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that N. parisii-infected worms produce primed offspring that are resistant to microsporidia infection. We find that immunity is induced in a dose dependent manner and lasts for a single generation. Intergenerational immunity prevents host cell invasion by N. parisii and also enhances survival to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further, we show that inherited immunity is triggered by the host transcriptional response to infection, which can also be induced through maternal somatic depletion of negative regulators PALS-22 and the retinoblastoma protein ortholog LIN-35. We show that other biotic and abiotic stresses, such as viral infection and cadmium exposure, that induce a similar transcriptional response to microsporidia can also induce immunity in progeny. Our results demonstrate that distinct stimuli can induce inherited immunity to provide resistance against multiple classes of pathogens. These results show that activation of an innate immune response can provide protection against pathogens not only within a generation, but also in the next generation.","Willis, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,143578,Determining the efficacy of hand sanitizers against virulent nosocomial infections,"The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of 0.13% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) (Steirolotion), 100% ethanol, and 70% ethyl alcohol (Purell) hand sanitizer in subduing the growth of nosocomial bacteria - methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) - when plated on culture media over an extended period of time. In addition, our objective was to quantify the length of time these hand sanitizer agents remained effective, and to extrapolate their efficacy in decreasing the transmission of hospital-acquired infections. 50 microliters of either BAC, 100% ethanol, or 70% ethyl alcohol hand gel sanitizer were pipetted onto Trypticase soy agar with 5% sheep blood plates that were cultured with either MRSA, VRE, or P. aeruginosa. The plates were then incubated at 37.0?. The zone of inhibition (ZOI) was measured daily for 5 days and additionally zones were noted whether or not regrowth recurred in areas where previous growth had initially been inhibited. BAC was found to be superior to both 100% ethanol and 70% ethyl alcohol in the inhibition of MRSA over all time points (p values < .05). BAC was found to be superior to 70% ethyl alcohol in the inhibition of VRE over all time points (p values < .05), but not statistically superior to 100% ethanol against the inhibition of VRE over any time points. BAC was found to be superior to 70% ethyl alcohol and 100% ethanol in the inhibition of pseudomonas over 72 and 24 hours, respectively (p values < .05). The results of this study demonstrate in vitro efficacy of BAC of preventing regrowth of common nosocomial bacteria over a prolonged period of time, especially when compared to ethyl alcohol. Further study is warranted to determine in vivo effectiveness of this formulation of BAC as well as the appropriate time frame of application for effectiveness against P. aeruginosa.","Najdawi, J.; Hubble, L.; Scarborough, A.; Watz, M.; Watson, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,143749,Genome diversity and quorum sensing variations in laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1,"The Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 has routinely been used as a laboratory model for quorum sensing (QS) studies due to its extensively coordinated regulatory circuits. However, the microevolution of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains resulting in genetic and phenotypic variations have caused inconsistencies in QS research. To investigate the underlying causes and impact of these variations, we analyzed 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 sublines from our laboratory using a combination of phenotypic characterization, high-throughput genome sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis. The major phenotypic variations among the sublines spanned across the levels of QS signals and virulence factors such as pyocyanin and elastase. Furthermore, the sublines exhibited distinct variations in swarming, twitching and biofilm formation. Most of the phenotypic variations were mapped to the effects of mutations in the lasR and mexT, which are key components of the QS circuit. By introducing these mutations in the subline PAO1-E, which is devoid of such mutations, we confirmed their influence on QS, virulence, motility and biofilm formation. The findings further highlight a possible divergent regulatory mechanism between the LasR and MexT in the QS pathways in P. aeruginosa. The results of our study reveal the effects of microevolution on the reproducibility of most research data from QS studies and further highlight mexT as a key component of the QS circuit of P. aeruginosa.

ImportanceMicroevolution of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains results in genotypic and phenotypic variations between strains that have a significant influence on QS research. This work highlights the variations present in P. aeruginosa PAO1 sublines and investigates the impact of the genetic variations on the QS circuit and QS-regulated virulence determinants. Using a combination of NGS and phenotypic analysis, we illustrate the impact of microevolution on the reproducibility of QS, virulence, motility, and biofilm studies among 5 sublines. Additionally, we revealed the significant impact of mutations in key genes such as mexT and lasR on the QS circuit and regulation of virulence. In effect, we show the need for limited propagation and proper handling of laboratory isolates to reduce the microevolution.","Liu, Y.; Ahator, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,143863,Pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted protein PA3611 promotes bronchial epithelial cells  epithelial-mesenchymal transition  through TGF-β1 inducing p38/miRNA/NF-κB pathway,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is one of the important pathogens, which has been proven to colonize and cause infection in the respiratory tract of patients with structural lung diseases, and further lead to bronchial fibrosis. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of bronchial epithelial cells plays a vital role in the process of bronchial fibrosis. Up to the present, the research on bronchial epithelial cells EMT caused by secreted virulence factors of PA has not been reported. In our present study, we found that PA3611 protein stimulation induced the bronchial epithelial cells EMT with up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers and down-regulation of epithelial cell markers. Meantime, TGF-{beta}1 secretion was markedly increased, I{kappa}B expression was significantly decreased, and NF-{kappa}B p65 subunit phosphorylation was markedly enhanced, in addition, the levels of miR-3065-3p and miR-6802-3p expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were obviously increased in bronchial epithelial cells after PA3611 stimulation, further research revealed that PA3611 promoted EMT occur through TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}b pathway. The function of PA3611 was also verified in PA-infected rats and results showed that {Delta}PA3611 could reduce lung inflammation and EMT. Overall, our results revealed that PA3611 promotes EMT via simulating the production of TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}B pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that PA3611 acts as a crucial virulence factor in bronchial epithelial cells EMT process and has potential use as a target for clinical treatment of bronchial EMT and fibrosis caused by chronic PA infection.

Author summaryStructural lung disease can increase the chance of chronic infection, including infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can cause lung structure damages and affect lung functions in further, and forming a vicious circle of intertwining, ultimately, it leads to pulmonary fibrosis. EMT of bronchial epithelial cells plays a vital role in the process of bronchial fibrosis. However, the relationship and mechanism of PA infection leads to the destruction of lung structure and bronchial epithelial cells EMT are still not very clear. We found pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted protein PA3611 can stimulate bronchial epithelial cells EMT through up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers -SMA and Vimentin expression and down-regulation of epithelial cell markers E-cadherin and Zonula Occludens-1. Meantime, TGF-{beta}1 secretion was markedly increased, I{kappa}B expression was significantly decreased, and NF-{kappa}B p65 subunit phosphorylation was markedly enhanced, in addition, the levels of miR-3065-3p and miR-6802-3p expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were obviously increased in bronchial epithelial cells after PA3611 stimulation, further studies suggested that PA3611 was shown to promote EMT occur through TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-Kb pathway. Our results revealed that PA3611 promotes EMT via simulating the production of TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}B pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that PA3611 acts as a crucial virulence factor in bronchial epithelial cells EMT process and as a potential target for the treatment of chronic structural lung diseases.","Shu, L.; Chen, S.; Chen, X.; Lin, S.; Du, X.; Deng, K.; Wei, J.; Cao, Y.; Yan, J.; Shen, Z.; Feng, G.; Sixia Chen, Xiaolin Chen, Shaoqing Lin, Xingran Du, Kaili Deng, Jing Wei, Yang Cao, Jiaxin Yan, Ziya,  ",2020-10-14,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.10.14.339044,1,Ganzhu  Feng,The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.339044v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.339044v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,143996,Cystic Fibrosis Acidic Microenvironment Determines Antibiotic Susceptibility and Biofilm Formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most prevalent bacterial species that contributes to cystic fibrosis (CF) respiratory failure. The impaired function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator leads to abnormal epithelial Cl- / HCO3- transport and acidification of airway surface liquid. However, it remains unclear why Pseudomonas aeruginosa preferentially colonizes in the CF lungs. In this study, we carried out studies to investigate if lower pH helps Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt and thrive in the CF-like acidic lung environment. Our results reveal that Pseudomonas aeruginosa generally forms more biofilm and induces antibiotic resistance faster in acidic conditions and that this can be reversed by returning the acidic environment to physiologically neutral conditions. Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be highly adaptive to the CF-like acidic pH environment. By studying the effects of an acidic environment on bacterial response, we may provide a new therapeutic option in preventing chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and colonization.","Lin, Q.; Pilewski, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,144315,Fine tuning cyclic-di-GMP signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the type 4 pili alignment complex,"To initiate biofilm formation it is critical for bacteria to sense a surface and respond precisely. Type 4 pili (T4P) have been shown to be important in surface sensing, however, mechanism(s) driving downstream changes important for the switch to biofilm growth have not been clearly defined. Here, using macroscopic bulk assays and single cell tracking analyses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we uncover a new role of the T4P alignment complex protein, PilO, in modulating the activity of the diguanylate cyclase (DGC) SadC. Two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays show that PilO physically interacts with SadC and that the PilO-SadC interaction inhibits SadCs activity resulting in decreased biofilm formation and increased motility. We show that disrupting the PilO-SadC interaction contributes to greater variation of cyclic-di-GMP levels among cells, thereby increasing cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the levels of this signal. Thus, this work shows that P. aeruginosa uses a component of the T4P scaffold to fine-tune the levels of this nucleotide signal during surface commitment. Finally, given our previous findings linking SadC to the flagellar machinery, we propose that this DGC acts as a bridge to integrate T4P and flagellar-derived input signals during initial surface engagement.

Significance StatementT4P of P. aeruginosa are important for surface sensing and regulating intracellular cyclic-di-GMP levels. This work identifies a new role for the T4P alignment complex, previously known for its role in supporting pili biogenesis, in surface-dependent signaling. Furthermore, our findings indicate that P. aeruginosa uses a single DGC, via a complex web of protein-protein interactions, to integrate signaling through the T4P and the flagellar motor to fine-tune cyclic-di-GMP levels. A key implication of this work is that more than just regulating signal levels, cells must modulate the dynamic range of cyclic-di-GMP to precisely control the transition to a biofilm lifestyle.","Webster, S.; Lee, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145119,Trehalose and α-glucan mediate distinct abiotic stress responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"An important prelude to bacterial infection is the ability of a pathogen to survive independently of the host and to withstand environmental stress. The compatible solute trehalose has previously been connected with diverse abiotic stress tolerances, particularly osmotic shock. In this study, we combine molecular biology and biochemistry to dissect the trehalose metabolic network in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and define its role in abiotic stress protection. We show that trehalose metabolism in PA01 is integrated with the biosynthesis of branched -glucan (glycogen), with mutants in either biosynthetic pathway significantly compromised for survival on abiotic surfaces. While both trehalose and -glucan are important for abiotic stress tolerance, we show they counter distinct stresses. Trehalose is vital to the PA01 osmotic stress response, with trehalose synthesis mutants displaying severely compromised growth in elevated salt conditions. However, trehalose does not contribute directly to the PA01 desiccation response. Rather, desiccation tolerance is mediated directly by GlgE-derived -glucan, with deletion of the glgE synthase gene compromising PA01 survival in low humidity but having little effect on osmotic sensitivity. Desiccation tolerance is independent of trehalose concentration, marking a clear distinction between the roles of these two molecules in mediating responses to abiotic stress.","Woodcock, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145090,Evolution of Antibiotic Tolerance Shapes Resistance Development in Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections,"The widespread use of antibiotics promotes the evolution and dissemination of resistance and tolerance mechanisms. To assess the relevance of tolerance and its implications for resistance development, we used in vitro evolution and analyzed inpatient microevolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen causing acute and chronic infections. We show that the development of tolerance precedes and promotes the acquisition of resistance in vitro and we present evidence that similar processes shape antibiotic exposure in human patients. Our data suggest that during chronic infections, P. aeruginosa first acquires moderate drug tolerance before following distinct evolutionary trajectories that lead to high-level multi-drug tolerance or to antibiotic resistance. Our studies propose that the development of antibiotic tolerance predisposes bacteria for the acquisition of resistance at early stages of infection and that both mechanisms independently promote bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment at later stages of chronic infections.","Santi, I.; Manfredi, P.; Maffei, E.; Egli, A.; Jenal, U.",2020-10-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.10.23.352104,1,Urs  Jenal,University of Basel,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.352104v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.23.352104v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1128/mbio.03482-20
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145095,Novel Immune Modulators Enhance Caenorhabditis elegans Resistance to Multiple Pathogens,"Traditionally, treatments for bacterial infection have focused on killing the microbe or preventing its growth. As antimicrobial resistance becomes more ubiquitous, the feasibility of this approach is beginning to wane and attention has begun to shift toward disrupting the host-pathogen interaction by improving the host defense. Using a high-throughput, fragment-based screen to identify compounds that alleviate Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified over 20 compounds that stimulated host defense gene expression. Five of these molecules were selected for further characterization. Four of five compounds showed little toxicity against mammalian cells or worms, consistent with their identification in a phenotypic, high-content screen. Each of the compounds activated several host defense pathways, but the pathways were generally dispensable for compound-mediated rescue in Liquid Killing, suggesting redundancy or that the activation of one or more unknown pathways may be driving compound effects. A genetic mechanism was identified for LK56, which required the Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 and NHR-49/HNF4 for its function. Interestingly, LK32, LK34, LK38, and LK56 also rescue C. elegans from P. aeruginosa in an agar-based assay, which uses different virulence factors and defense mechanisms. Rescue in an agar-based assay for LK38 entirely depended upon the PMK-1/p38 MAPK pathway. Three compounds, LK32, LK34, and LK56 also conferred resistance to Enterococcus faecalis, and the two lattermost, LK34 and LK56, also reduced pathogenesis from Staphylococcus aureus. This study supports a growing role for MDT-15 and NHR-49 in immune response and identifies 5 molecules that with significant potential for use as tools in the investigation of innate immunity.

Author SummaryTwo trends moving in opposite directions (the increase in antimicrobial resistance and the decline of commercial interest in the discovery and development of novel antimicrobials) have precipitated a looming crisis: a nearly complete inability to safely and effectively treat bacterial infections. To avert this, new approaches in healthcare are needed. One approach that is receiving increasing attention is to stimulate host defense pathways, to improve the clearance of bacterial infections. We describe five small molecules that promote host resistance to infectious bacteria, at least partially by activating C. elegans innate immune pathways. Several are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Three molecules, LK34, LK35, and LK38 have highly overlapping downstream target genes, suggesting that they act on common pathways, despite having distinct chemical structures. One of the compounds was mapped to the action of MDT-15/MED15 and NHR-49/HNF4, a pair of transcriptional regulators more generally associated with fatty acid metabolism, potentially highlighting a new link between these biological functions. These studies pave the way for future characterization of the anti-infective activity of the molecules in higher organisms and highlight the compounds potential utility for further investigation of immune modulation as a novel therapeutic approach.","Hummell, N.

In this study, we systemically investigated A. annua L. for its antimicrobial activity and assessed it as a source of bioactive natural products for anti-mycobacterial activity.

We used a silica gel column to perform antimicrobial activity-guided purification of the A. annua leaf, whose identity was confirmed by rbcL DNA barcoding, and used UHPLC-HRMS and NMR to elucidate the structure of purified active compounds. The antimicrobial activity of crude extracts, isolated compounds and the control artemisinin (Apollo Scientific Ltd) was assessed against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Mycobacterium smegmatis strains by serial micro dilution method (31.25-1000 g/mL). The isolated compounds were tested for synergistic effects against mycobacterium.

Bioactive compounds were purified and identified as deoxyartemisinin and artemisinic acid.

R-bodies are large, extendable protein polymers best known for their role in killing of paramecia by the bacterium Caedibacter taeniospiralis, and genes in the reb cluster have been implicated in PA14 virulence. Here, we present evidence that PA14 expresses reb cluster genes during colonization of plant and nematode hosts. We identify products of the reb cluster that are R-body-associated and that control stochastic expression of R-body structural genes. We also show that R-body production is required for full virulence in nematodes. Analyses of nematode ribosome content and immune response indicate that R-bodies act via a mechanism involving ribosome cleavage and translational inhibition. These observations provide insight into the biology of R-body production and its consequences during P. aeruginosa infection.","Wang, B.; Lin, Y.-C.; Vasquez-Rifo, A.; Jo, J.; Price-Whelan, A.; Tao Mcdonald, S.; Brown, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145844,Structural basis for effector transmembrane domain recognition by type VI secretion system chaperones,"Type VI secretion systems facilitate the delivery of antibacterial effector proteins between neighbouring Gram-negative bacteria. A subset of these effectors harbor N-terminal transmembrane domains (TMDs) implicated in effector translocation across the target cell membrane. However, the abundance and distribution of these TMD-containing effectors has remained unknown. Here we report the discovery of prePAAR, a conserved motif found in over 6,000 putative TMD-containing effectors. Based on their differing sizes and number of TMDs these effectors fall into two distinct classes that are unified by their requirement for a member of the Eag family of T6SS chaperones for export. Co-crystal structures of class I and class II effector TMD-chaperone complexes from Salmonella Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively, reveals that Eag chaperones mimic transmembrane helical packing to stabilize effector TMDs. In addition to participating in the chaperone-TMD interface, we find that prePAAR functions to facilitate proper folding of the downstream PAAR domain, which is required for effector interaction with the T6SS spike. Taken together, our findings define the mechanism of chaperone-assisted secretion of a widespread family of T6SS membrane protein effectors.","Ahmad, S.; Tsang, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145933,Engineering Gac/Rsm signaling cascade for optogenetic induction of pathogenicity switch in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacterial pathogens operate by tightly controlling the pathogenicity to facilitate invasion and survival in host. While small molecule inducers can be designed to modulate pathogenicity to perform studies of pathogen-host interaction, these approaches, due to the diffusion property of chemicals, may have unintended, or pleiotropic effects that can impose limitations on their use. By contrast, light provides superior spatial and temporal resolution. Here, using optogenetics we reengineered GacS of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, signal transduction protein of the global Gac/Rsm cascade which is of central importance for regulation of infection factors. The resultant protein YGS24 displayed significant light-dependent activity of GacS kinases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When introduced in Caenorhabditis elegans host systems, YGS24 stimulated the pathogenicity of PAO1 in BHI and of PA14 in SK medium progressively upon blue-light exposure. This optogenetic system provides an accessible way to spatiotemporally control bacterial pathogenicity in defined host even specific tissues to develop new pathogenesis systems, which may in turn expedite development of innovative therapeutics.","Cheng, X.; Pu, L.; Fu, S.; Xia, A.; Huang, S.; Ni, L.; Xing, X.; Yang, S.; Jin, F.",2021-02-26,Synthetic Biology,10.1101/2020.10.28.358515,4,Fan  Jin,"Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences;",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.358515v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.28.358515v4.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1021/acssynbio.1c00075
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,145736,Multiple Holins Contribute to Extracellular DNA Release in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms,"Bacterial biofilms are comprised of aggregates of cells encased within a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). One key EPS component is extracellular DNA (eDNA), which acts as a  glue, facilitating cell-cell and cell-substratum interactions. We have previously demonstrated that eDNA is produced in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms via explosive cell lysis. This phenomenon involves a subset of the bacterial population explosively lysing, due to peptidoglycan degradation by the endolysin Lys. Here we demonstrate that in P. aeruginosa three holins, AlpB, CidA and Hol, are involved in Lys-mediated eDNA release within both submerged (hydrated) and interstitial (actively expanding) biofilms, albeit to different extents, depending upon the type of biofilm and the stage of biofilm development. We also demonstrate that eDNA release events determine the sites at which cells begin to cluster to initiate microcolony formation during the early stages of submerged biofilm development. Furthermore, our results show that sustained release of eDNA is required for cell cluster consolidation and subsequent microcolony development in submerged biofilms. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of how eDNA release is controlled temporally and spatially within P. aeruginosa biofilms.","Hynen, A. L.; Lazenby, J. J.; Savva, G. M.; Mccaughey, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,146003,Evolution and adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the paranasal sinuses of people with cystic fibrosis,"People with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) harbor lifelong respiratory infections, with morbidity and mortality frequently linked to chronic lung infections dominated by the opportunistically pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During chronic CF lung infections, a single clone of P. aeruginosa can persist for decades and dominate end-stage CF lung disease due to its propensity to adaptively evolve to the respiratory environment, a process termed ""pathoadaptation"". Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), chronic inflammation and infection of the sinonasal space, is highly prevalent in CF and the sinuses may serve as the first site in the respiratory tract to become colonized by bacteria that then proceed to seed lung infections. We identified three evolutionary genetic routes by which P. aeruginosa evolves in the sinuses of people with CF, including through the evolution of mutator lineages and proliferative insertion sequences and culminating in early genomic signatures of host-restriction. Our findings raise the question of whether a significant portion of the pathoadaptive phenotypes previously thought to have evolved in response to selective pressures in the CF lungs may have first arisen in the sinuses and underscore the link between sinonasal and lung disease in CF.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,146042,Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans both accumulate greater biomass in dual species biofilms under flow,"Spatially structured communities of microbes - biofilms - are widespread in nature, and biofilm-dwelling microbes often respond to their environments in ways that are different from their planktonic counterparts. Further, most natural biofilms are multi-species mixtures of microorganisms; the ecology of intra- and inter-species interactions in these consortia, and the resulting effects on total community properties, are often not well understood. A common site of polymicrobial biofilm infections is the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder in humans that leads to colonization of the lungs by a variety of microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. These opportunistic pathogens are frequently co-isolated from infected lungs, in addition to other infection sites including urinary and intravenous catheters. To study how these microbes behave together in biofilms, we developed a modified artificial sputum medium that is optically clear for use with microfluidic culture. In addition, we engineered strains with optimized fluorescent protein expression constructs allowing for single-cell resolution confocal microscopy. Using these tools and recently developed methods for spatial analysis of 3-D image data, we found that both P. aeruginosa and C. albicans display increased biovolume accumulation in multi-species biofilms relative to single-species biofilms. This pattern did not occur in planktonic co-culture and was thus specific to the biofilm environment. Interestingly, introduction of P. aeruginosa supernatants over dual-species biofilms strongly reduced C. albicans biovolume. This suggests that products that accumulate in batch culture were still inhibitory to C. albicans under a flow regime, but that they their de novo production in mixed species biofilms was not sufficient to inhibit C. albicans biofilm accumulation. Altogether our results indicate a critical impact of flow environment for the outcome of polymicrobial interactions and the need for high-resolution analysis of such communities in future work.","Kasetty, S.; Mould, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,146673,The bacterial toxin ExoU requires a host trafficking chaperone for transportation and to induce necrosis,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a causative agent in nosocomial infections, notably in ventilated or cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa isolates expressing the phospholipase ExoU, an effector of the type III secretion system, are the most pathogenic in clinics. Here, using a genome-wide screen, we discovered that ExoU toxicity requires DNAJC5, a host chaperone, to exert its necrotic activity. DNAJC5 is involved in an unconventional secretory pathway for misfolded proteins involving anterograde vesicular trafficking. DNAJC5-deficient human cells or Drosophila flies knocked-down for the DNAJC5 orthologue were largely resistant to ExoU virulence. ExoU colocalized with DNAJC5-positive vesicles in the host cytoplasm. DNAJC5 mutations preventing vesicle trafficking - identified in adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a human congenital disease - inhibited ExoU-dependent cell lysis. These results suggest that, once injected into the host cytoplasm, ExoU docks to DNAJC5-positive secretory vesicles to reach the plasma membrane, where its phospholipase activity is triggered by binding to PI(4,5)P2.","Deruelle, V.; Bouillot, S.; Job, V.; Taillebourg, E.; Fauvarque, M.-O.; Attree, I.; Huber, P.",2020-11-04,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.04.367706,1,Philippe  Huber,CEA,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367706v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.04.367706v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41467-021-24337-9
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,147091,"Predatory selection of mucoid, antibiotic resistant Pseudomonas putida phenotype by myxobacterium Cystobacter ferrugineus","Predation contributes to the structure and diversity of microbial communities. Predatory myxobacteria are ubiquitous to a variety of microbial habitats and capably consume a broad diversity of microbial prey. Predator-prey experiments utilizing myxobacteria have provided details into predatory mechanisms and features that facilitate consumption of prey. However, prey resistance to myxobacterial predation remains underexplored, and prey resistances have been observed exclusively from predator-prey experiments that included the model myxobacterium Myxococcus xanthus. Utilizing a predator-prey pairing that instead included the myxobacterium, Cystobacter ferrugineus, with Pseudomonas putida as prey, we infrequently observed surviving phenotypes capable of eluding predation. Comparative transcriptomics between P. putida unexposed to C. ferrugineus and the survivor phenotype suggested that increased expression of efflux pumps, genes associated with mucoid conversion, and various membrane features contribute to predator avoidance. The P. putida survivor phenotype was confirmed to be resistant to the antibiotics kanamycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline and to produce more alginate, pyoveridine, and phenazine-1-carboxylic acid than predator-unexposed P. putida. Unique features observed from the survivor phenotype including small colony variation, efflux-mediated antibiotic resistance, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid production, and increased mucoid conversion overlap with traits associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa predator avoidance and pathogenicity. The survivor phenotype also benefited from increased predator resistance during subsequent predation assays. These results demonstrate the utility of myxobacterial predator-prey models and provide insight into prey resistances in response to predatory stress might contribute to the phenotypic diversity and structure of bacterial communities.","Akbar, S.; Stevens, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,147971,"Identification of a Putative Sensor Protein Involved in Regulation of Vesicle Production by a Hypervesiculating Bacterium, Shewanella vesiculosa HM13","Bacteria secrete and utilize nanoparticles, called extracellular membrane vesicles (EMVs), for survival in their growing environments. Therefore, the amount and components of EMVs should be tuned in response to the environment. However, how bacteria regulate vesiculation in response to the extracellular environment remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified a putative sensor protein, HM1275, involved in the induction of vesicle production in a hypervesiculating Gram-negative bacterium, Shewanella vesiculosa HM13. This protein was predicted to possess typical sensing and signaling domains of sensor proteins, such as methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Comparison of vesicle production between the hm1275-disrupted mutant and the parent strain revealed that HM1275 is involved in lysine-induced hypervesiculation. Moreover, HM1275 has sequence similarity to a biofilm dispersion protein, BdlA, of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, and hm1275 disruption increased the amount of biofilm. Thus, this study showed that the induction of vesicle production and suppression of biofilm formation in response to lysine concentration are under the control of the same putative sensor protein.","Yokoyama, F.; Imai, T.; Aoki, W.; Ueda, M.; Kawamoto, J.; Kurihara, T.",2020-11-12,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.12.373589,1,Tatsuo  Kurihara,"Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.12.373589v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.12.373589v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3389/fmicb.2021.629023
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,148241,Tobramycin adaptation enhances policing of social cheaters in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR-I quorum sensing (QS) system regulates secreted proteases that can be exploited by cheaters, such as QS receptor-defective (lasR) mutants. lasR mutants emerge in populations growing on casein as a sole source of carbon and energy and increase in the population because they do not incur the substantial cost of engaging in QS. QS also increases resistance to some antibiotics, such as tobramycin. Here, we show that tobramycin suppresses the emergence of lasR mutants in casein-passaged populations. We also identify several mutations that accumulate in those populations indicating evidence of antibiotic adaptation. Mutations in one gene, ptsP, increase activity of the LasR-I system and production of a QS-controlled phenazine, pyocyanin. We find that mutations in ptsP lead to suppression of cheaters independent of tobramycin. Cheater suppression relies on pyocyanin, which acts as a policing toxin by targeting cheaters. These results show that tobramycin suppresses lasR mutants through two mechanisms: first, by directly acting on tobramycin-susceptible cheaters and second, by selecting mutations in ptsP that lead to pyocyanin-dependent policing. This work demonstrates how adaptive mutations can alter the dynamics of cooperator-cheater relationships, which might be important for populations adapting to antibiotics during infections.","Abisado, R.; Kimbrough, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,148747,A wide-ranging Pseudomonas aeruginosa PeptideAtlas build: a useful proteomic resource for a versatile pathogen.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen with high prevalence in nosocomial infections. This microorganism is a good model for understanding biological processes such as the quorum-sensing response, the metabolic integration of virulence, the mechanisms of global regulation of bacterial physiology, and the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Till now, P. aeruginosa proteomic data, although available in several on-line repositories, were dispersed and difficult to access. In the present work, proteomes of the PAO1 strain grown under very different conditions and from diverse cellular compartments have been analyzed and joined to build the Pseudomonas PeptideAtlas. This resource is a comprehensive mass spectrometry-derived peptide and inferred protein database with 71.3% coverage of the total predicted proteome of P. aeruginosa PAO1. This is the highest published coverage among the eight bacterial PeptideAtlas datasets currently available. The proteins in the Pseudomonas PeptideAtlas cover 84% of metabolic proteins, 71% of proteins involved in genetic information processing, 72% of proteins responsible for environmental information processing, more than 80% of proteins related to quorum sensing and biofilm formation, and 81% of proteins responsible for antimicrobial resistance. It exemplifies a necessary tool for targeted proteomics studies, system-wide observations, and cross-species observational studies. Here we describe how this resource was built and some of the physiologically important proteins of this pathogen.

SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is among the most versatile bacterial pathogens. Studies of its proteome are very important as they can reveal virulence factors and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. The construction of a proteomic resource such as the PeptideAtlas enables targeted proteomics studies, system-wide observations, and cross-species observational studies.","Reales-Calderon, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,148789,Bivariate confidence probability plots as a method to test the accuracy and variability of microbiological measures,"IntroductionIn an interlaboratory calibration analysis to validate a methodology that will be proposed as a European standard for domestic laundry disinfection, tests were carried out to detect if there are different behaviors in the measurements regarding accuracies and variabilities. Interlaboratory tests using different doses of disinfectant and microorganisms were carried out. ISO 5725-2 and ISO 13528 form the basis of validations of quantitative methods, providing validation specifications for interlaboratory studies. However, a need for a simple graphical method to detect interlaboratory differences in accuracy and variability was observed.

ObjectivesThe general goal of this work is to present a new exploratory methodology, graphical and easy to interpret, that can determine the accuracy and variability (precision) of a variable, and compare it to the methodology applied in ISO 5725-2 and ISO 13528.

MethodsWe used confidence probability plots of the multivariate Students t-distribution to observe the accuracy and variability of microbiological measures carried out by different laboratories during a ring trial exercise. A function in R was built for this purpose: Miriam.analysis.ellipse(Y, factor_a, eel.plot = "" t-Student""). The different observations of accuracy and variability are represented in the ellipses. If any of the points are outside the ellipse with 95% confidence, we can assume a deviation in accuracy and / or variability.

ResultsTwo examples are provided with real microbiological data (logarithmic unit reductions (LR) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphilococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae, Candida albicans and microbial counts in water (WW)). The proposed new method allowed us to detect possible deviations in the WWMEA variable and we believe it has future application for the rapid control of microbiological measures.","Monleon Getino, A.; Ac Marca Home Care,  ",2020-11-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.18.388603,1,Antonio  Monleon Getino,University of Barcelona,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388603v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388603v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,148817,"Heme dependent transcriptional regulation of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa tandem sRNA prrF1,F2 locus by the cytoplasmic heme binding protein PhuS","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen requiring iron for its survival and virulence. P. aeruginosa can acquire iron from heme via the heme assimilation system (Has) and Pseudomonas heme uptake (Phu) systems. The Has and Phu systems have non-redundant roles in heme sensing and transport, respectively. However, despite their respective roles heme taken up by either the Has or Phu system is regulated at the metabolic level by the cytoplasmic heme binding protein PhuS, which controls heme flux through the iron-regulated heme oxygenase HemO. Herein, through a combination of CHIP-PCR, EMSA and fluorescence anisotropy we show PhuS binds upstream of the tandem iron-responsive sRNAs prrF1,F2. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of the PAO1 WT and {Delta}phuS allelic strain shows loss of PhuS abrogates the heme dependent regulation of PrrH. Taken together our data shows PhuS, in addition to its role in regulating extracellular heme metabolism also functions as a transcriptional regulator of the heme-dependent sRNA, PrrH. This dual function of PhuS is central to integrating extracellular heme utilization into the PrrF/PrrH sRNA regulatory network critical for P. aeruginosa adaptation and virulence within the host.","Wilson, T.; Mourino, S.; Wilks, A.",2020-11-19,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.18.388926,1,Angela  Wilks,University of Maryland,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388926v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.18.388926v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100275
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,149739,Prophage elements function as reservoir for antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in nosocomial pathogens,"Prophages are often involved in host survival strategies and contribute toward increasing the genetic diversity of the host genome. Prophages also drive horizontal propagation of various genes as vehicles. However, there are few retrospective studies contributing to the propagation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence factor (VF) genes by prophage. In this study, we extracted complete genome sequences of seven pathogens, including ESKAPE bacteria and Escherichia coli deposited in a public database, and examined the distribution of both AMR and VF genes in certain genomic regions of prophage, including prophage-like element. We found that the ratios of AMR and VF genes greatly varied among the seven species. More than 55% of Enterobacter cloacae strains had VF genes, but only 0.8% of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains had VF genes from prophages. The prophage types carrying AMR genes were detected in a broad range of hosts, whereas prophages containing VF genes were conserved in only one or two species, suggesting that distribution patterns of prophages were different between prophages encoding AMR or VF genes. We also found that the prophage containing class 1 integrase possessed a significantly higher number of AMR genes than prophages with no class 1 integrase. Moreover, AMR genes in the prophage were located near transposase and integrase. The results of this study reveal a comprehensive picture of AMR and VF genes present in prophage elements and provide new insights into the horizontal transfer of genes associated with antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity.

ImportanceAlthough we believe phages play an important role in horizontal gene transfer in exchanging genetic material, we do not know the distribution of the antimicrobial resistance and/or virulence genes in prophages. We collected different prophage elements from the complete genome sequence of seven species - Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter cloacae, as well as Escherichia coli -, and characterized the distribution of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes encoded in the prophage region. While virulence genes in prophage were found to be species-specific, antimicrobial resistance genes in prophages were highly conserved in various species. Integron structure was detected within prophage regions in almost all of the genera. Maximum of 11 antimicrobial resistance genes were found in a single prophage region, suggesting that prophages act as a reservoir for antimicrobial resistance genes. Our results highlight new insights on prophages as horizontal gene carriers.","Kondo, K.; Kawano, M.; Sugai, M.",2020-11-25,Microbiology,10.1101/2020.11.24.397166,1,Kohei  Kondo,National Institute of Infectious Diseases,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.397166v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.24.397166v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,150768,In vitro analysis of colistin and ciprofloxacin antagonism of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage PEV2 infection activities,"Phage therapy is a century-old technique employing viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections. In the clinic, phage therapy often is used in combination with antibiotics. Antibiotics, however, interfere with critical bacterial activities, such as DNA and protein synthesis, which also are required for phage infection processes. Resulting antagonistic impacts of antibiotics on phages nevertheless are not commonly determined in association with phage therapy studies using standard, planktonic approaches. Here we assess the antagonistic impact of two antibiotics, colistin and ciprofloxacin, on the bactericidal, bacteriolytic, and new virion production activities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa podovirus PEV2, using a broth culture, optical density-based  lysis profile assay. Though phage-antibiotic combinations were more potent in reducing cell viability than phages or antibiotics alone, colistin substantially interfered with phage PEV2 bacteriolytic and virion-production activities at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Ciprofloxacin, by contrast, had no such impact at 1x MIC or 3x MIC. At higher but still clinically relevant concentrations (9x MIC) burst sizes were still significant (~30 phages/infected bacterium). We corroborated these lysis profile results by more traditional measurements (colony forming units, plaque forming units, one-step growth experiments) and two other P. aeruginosa phages. To our knowledge this is the first study in which detailed antibiotic impact on P. aeruginosa phage infection activities has been determined under conditions similar to those used to determine antibiotic MICs and could point especially to ciprofloxacin as a minimally antagonistic phage therapy co-treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.","Danis-Wlodarczyk, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,150783,A Robust Genome-Wide Association Study Uncovers Signature Genetic Alterations among Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis Isolates,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes diverse human infections such as chronic airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although many sequenced genomes are available, a comprehensive comparison between genomes of CF versus non-CF PA isolates remains yet to be conducted. In order to gain a deeper understanding into the PA adaptation in the CF airway, we performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) using a total of 1,001 PA genomes. Genetic variations uniquely identified among CF isolates were categorized into (i) alterations in protein-coding regions either large- or small-scale and (ii) polymorphic variations in intergenic regions. We introduced each CF-specific genetic alteration into the genome of PAO1, a prototype PA strain and experimentally validated their outcomes. Loci readily mutated among CF isolates include genes encoding a probable sulphatase and a probable TonB-dependent receptor (PA2332~PA2336), L-cysteine transporter (YecS, PA0313) and a probable transcriptional regulator (PA5438). A promoter region of heme/hemoglobin uptake outer membrane receptor (PhuR, PA4710) was similarly identified as meaningfully different between the CF and non-CF isolate groups. Our analysis, the first of its kind, highlights how PA evolves its genome to persist and survive within the context of chronic CF infection.","Hwang, W.; Yong, J. H.; Min, K. B.; Lee, K.-M.; Yoon, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,151283,A Grad-seq view of RNA and protein complexes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under standard and bacteriophage predation conditions,"The Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not only a major cause of nosocomial infections but also serves as a model species of bacterial RNA biology. While its transcriptome architecture and post-transcriptional regulation through the RNA-binding proteins Hfq, RsmA and RsmN have been studied in detail, global information about stable RNA-protein complexes is currently lacking in this human pathogen. Here, we implement Gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in exponentially growing P. aeruginosa cells to comprehensively predict RNA and protein complexes, based on glycerol gradient sedimentation profiles of >73% of all transcripts and [~]40% of all proteins. As to benchmarking, our global profiles readily reported complexes of stable RNAs of P. aeruginosa, including 6S RNA with RNA polymerase and associated pRNAs. We observe specific clusters of non-coding RNAs, which correlate with Hfq and RsmA/N, and provide a first hint that P. aeruginosa expresses a ProQ-like FinO domain containing RNA-binding protein. To understand how biological stress may perturb cellular RNA/protein complexes, we performed Grad-seq after infection by the bacteriophage {Phi}KZ. This model phage, which has a well-defined transcription profile during host takeover, displayed efficient translational utilization of phage mRNAs and tRNAs, as evident from their increased co-sedimentation with ribosomal subunits. Additionally, Grad-seq experimentally determines previously overlooked phage-encoded non-coding RNAs. Taken together, the Pseudomonas protein and RNA complex data provided here will pave the way to a better understanding of RNA-protein interactions during viral predation of the bacterial cell.

IMPORTANCEStable complexes by cellular proteins and RNA molecules lie at the heart of gene regulation and physiology in any bacterium of interest. It is therefore crucial to globally determine these complexes in order to identify and characterize new molecular players and regulation mechanisms. Pseudomonads harbour some of the largest genomes known in bacteria, encoding [~]5,500 different proteins. Here, we provide a first glimpse on which proteins and cellular transcripts form stable complexes in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We additionally performed this analysis with bacteria subjected to the important and frequently encountered biological stress of a bacteriophage infection. We identified several molecules with established roles in a variety of cellular pathways, which were affected by the phage and can now be explored for their role during phage infection. Most importantly, we observed strong co-localization of phage transcripts and host ribosomes, indicating the existence of specialized translation mechanisms during phage infection.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,151606,Condensins are essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa corneal virulence through their control of phenotypic programs,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant opportunistic pathogen responsible for a variety of human infections. Its high pathogenicity resides in a diverse array of virulence factors and an ability to adapt to hostile environments. We report that these factors are tied to the activity of condensins, SMC and MksBEF, which primarily function in structural chromosome maintenance. This study revealed that both proteins are required for P. aeruginosa virulence during corneal infection. The reduction in virulence was traced to broad changes in gene expression. Transcriptional signatures of smc and mksB mutants were largely dissimilar and non-additive, with the double mutant displaying a distinct gene expression profile. Affected regulons included those responsible for lifestyle control, primary metabolism, surface adhesion and biofilm growth, iron and sulfur assimilation, and denitrification. Additionally, numerous virulence factors were affected, including type 3 and type 6 secretion systems, hemagglutinin, pyocin and macroglobulin production, and a host of virulence regulators. in vitro properties of condensin mutants mirrored their transcriptional profiles. MksB-deficient cells were impaired in pyocyanin, c-di-GMP production, and sessile growth whereas smc mutants mildly upregulated c-di-GMP, secreted fewer proteases and were growth deficient under nutrient-limiting conditions. Moreover, condensin mutants displayed an abnormal regulation upon transition to stationary phase. These data reveal that condensins are integrated into the control of multiple genetic programs related to epigenetic and virulent behavior, establishing condensins as an essential factor in P. aeruginosa ocular infections.

Author SummaryBacterial pathogenicity is a complex phenomenon dependent on the ability of a bacterium to thrive in a hostile environment while combating the host using an array of virulence factors. This study reports that pathogenicity is also tied to structural chromosome maintenance through condensins, proteins that are responsible for the global organization of the chromosome. We show that the two Pseudomonas aeruginosa condensins, SMC and MksB, act as global regulators of gene expression. The inactivation of SMC and MksB induces opposite regulatory programs in the cell that resemble those observed during the acute and chronic phases of infection. A substantial portion of this regulation is mediated by the intracellular signaling network of P. aeruginosa. Accordingly, virulence regulation is altered in condensin mutants. The results were validated by genetic, phenotypic and virulence studies of condensin mutants. Overall, these data establish condensins as an essential factor during ocular P. aeruginosa infections revealing their involvement in the regulatory virulence network and the control of the bacterial lifestyle.","Zhao, H.; Clevenger, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,152023,"Chemical Inhibitors of DksA1, a Conserved Bacterial Transcriptional Regulator, Suppressed Quorum Sensing-Mediated Virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium of clinical importance. As an opportunistic pathogen, its virulence is dependent on quorum sensing (QS). Stringent response (SR), a conserved mechanism in the bacterial kingdom, is activated under diverse stress conditions including nutrient starvation. DksA1, an RNA polymerase-binding transcriptional regulator, plays a role in P. aeruginosa SR. Our recent study clearly demonstrated that, apart from SR, DksA1 regulates a wide range of phenotypes including QS-mediated virulence. This suggests that DksA1 is a potential target to be inhibited to control P. aeruginosa infections. Here, we screened a library of 6,970 chemical compounds and identified two compounds (termed Dkstatin-1 and Dkstatin-2) that specifically suppress DksA1 activity. Two Dkstatins substantially suppressed production of elastase and pyocyanin and protected a murine host against lethal infection with PAO1, a prototype strain of P. aeruginosa. Dkstatins also suppressed the production of homoserine lactone (HSL)-based autoinducers that activate P. aeruginosa QS. The level of 3-oxo-C12-HSL produced in Dkstatin-treated cells was almost identical to that in the {Delta}dksAI mutant of PAO1. Our RNASeq analysis showed that transcript levels of genes involved in QS and virulence were markedly reduced in Dkstatin-treated PAO1 cells, further demonstrating that Dkstatin-mediated suppression occurs at the transcriptional level. Importantly, Dkstatins increased antibiotic susceptibilities of PAO1, particularly to the antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. Our co-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that Dkstatins interfere with the binding of DksA1 to the {beta} subunit of RNA polymerase, which potentially explains the mode of Dkstatin action. Collectively, our results suggest that the inhibition of P. aeruginosa QS, which has often been attempted, can be achieved by DksA1 inhibitors. Dkstatins will prove to be useful when establishing infection control strategies.

Author summaryBacterial cells developed numerous systems to handle environmental stresses. Stringent response (SR) is one of those systems, and it is activated under the stress of nutrient starvation. Active SR requires DksA1, a protein conserved across bacterial species. Besides this well-recognized function, DksA1 in P. aeruginosa positively regulates its virulence by activating quorum sensing (QS). This finding led us to hypothesize that inhibiting DksA1 would result in virulence attenuation of the pathogenic P. aeruginosa. Herein, we identified two molecules that effectively suppressed DksA1 function through a large-scale compound library screen. These two compounds suppressed P. aeruginosa virulence and therefore protected a murine host from a deadly infection of P. aeruginosa. Moreover, the compounds also rendered P. aeruginosa more susceptible to antibiotics. Our results demonstrate that dangerous P. aeruginosa infections can be controlled by inhibiting DksA1.","Min, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,152869,Experimental evolution to identify undescribed mechanisms of resistance to a novel cationic peptide antibiotic,"A key strategy for resolving the antibiotic resistance crisis is the development of new drugs with antimicrobial properties. The engineered cationic antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 (also known as PLG0206) is a promising broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound that has completed Phase I clinical studies. It has activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including infections associated with biofilm. No definitive mechanisms of resistance to WLBU2 have been identified. Here, we used experimental evolution under different levels of mutation supply and whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the genetic pathways and probable mechanisms of resistance to this peptide. We propagated populations of wild-type and mutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of WLBU2 and performed WGS of evolved populations and clones. Populations that survived WLBU2 treatment acquired a minimum of two mutations, making the acquisition of resistance more difficult than for most antibiotics, which can be tolerated by mutation of a single target. Major targets of resistance to WLBU2 included the orfN and pmrB genes, previously described to confer resistance to other cationic peptides. More surprisingly, mutations that increase aggregation such as the wsp pathway were also selected despite the ability of WLBU2 to kill cells growing in a biofilm. The results show how the experimental evolution and WGS can identify genetic targets and actions of new antimicrobial compounds and predict pathways to resistance of new antibiotics in clinical practice.","Santos Lopez, A.; Fritz, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,152897,NirA is an alternative nitrite reductase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with potential as an anti-virulence target,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces an arsenal of virulence factors causing a wide range of diseases in multiple hosts and is difficult to eradicate due to its intrinsic resistance to antibiotics. With the antibacterial pipeline drying up, anti-virulence therapy has become an attractive alternative strategy to the traditional use of antibiotics to treat P. aeruginosa infections. To identify P. aeruginosa genes required for virulence in multiple hosts, a random library of Tn5 mutants in PAO1-L was previously screened in vitro for those showing pleiotropic effects in the production of virulence phenotypes. Using this strategy, we have identified a Tn5 mutant with an insertion in PA4130 showing reduced levels in a number of virulence traits in vitro. Construction of an isogenic mutant in this gene presented similar results as those from the Tn5 mutant. Furthermore, the PA4130 isogenic mutant showed substantial attenuation in disease models of Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans as well as decreased toxicity in human cell lines. This mutant also presented an 80% increased survival in murine acute and agar-bead lung infection models. PA4130 codes for a protein with homology to nitrite and sulphite reductases. Overexpression of PA4130 in the presence of the siroheme synthase CysG enabled its purification as a soluble protein. Methyl viologen oxidation assays with purified PA4130 showed that this protein is a nitrite reductase operating in a siroheme and 4Fe-4S dependant manner. The preference for nitrite and the production of ammonium revealed that PA4130 is an ammonia:ferredoxin nitrite reductase and hence was named as NirA.","Fenn, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,153319,The bacterial virulence factors rhamnolipids and their (R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate precursors activate Arabidopsis innate immunity through two independent mechanisms,"Plant innate immunity is activated upon perception of invasion pattern molecules by plant cell-surface immune receptors. Several bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas and Burkholderia produce rhamnolipids (RLs) from L- rhamnose and (R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate precursors (HAAs). RL and HAA secretion is required to modulate bacterial surface motility, biofilm development, and thus successful colonization of hosts. Here, we show that the lipidic secretome from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa mostly comprising RLs and HAAs stimulates Arabidopsis immunity. We demonstrate that HAAs are sensed by the bulb-type lectin receptor kinase LIPOOLIGOSACCHARIDE-SPECIFIC REDUCED ELICITATION/S-DOMAIN-1-29 (LORE/SD1-29) that also mediates medium-chain 3-hydroxy fatty acid (mc-3-OH-FA) perception in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. HAA sensing induces canonical immune signaling and local resistance to plant pathogenic Pseudomonas infection. By contrast, RLs trigger an atypical immune response and resistance to Pseudomonas infection independent of LORE. Thus, the glycosyl moieties of RLs, albeit abolishing sensing by LORE, do not impair their ability to trigger plant defense. In addition, our results show that RL-triggered immune response is affected by the sphingolipid composition of the plasma membrane. In conclusion, RLs and their precursors released by bacteria can both be perceived by plants but through distinct mechanisms.

SignificanceActivation of plant innate immunity relies on the perception of microorganisms through self and nonself elicitors. Rhamnolipids and their precursor HAAs are exoproducts produced by beneficial and pathogenic bacteria. They are involved in bacterial surface dissemination and biofilm development. As these compounds are released in the extracellular milieu, they have the potential to be perceived by the plant immune system. Our work shows that both compounds independently activate plant immunity. We demonstrate that HAAs are perceived by the receptor protein kinase LORE. By contrast, rhamnolipids are not senses by LORE but activate a non-canonical immune response affected by the sphingolipid composition of the plant plasma membrane. Thus, plants are able to sense bacterial molecules as well as their direct precursors to trigger a distinct immune response.","Schellenberger, R.; Crouzet, J.; Nickzad, A.; Kutschera, A.; Gerster, T.; Borie, N.; Dawid, C.; Cloutier, M.; Villaume, S.; Dhondt-Cordelier, S.; Hubert, J.; Cordelier, S.; Mazeyrat-Gourbeyre, F.; Schmid, C.; Ongena, M.; Renault, J.-H.; Haudrechy, A.; Hofmann, T.; Baillieul, F.; Clement, C.; Zipfel, C.; Gauthier, C.; Deziel, E.; Ranf, S.; Dorey, S.",2021-01-20,Plant Biology,10.1101/2020.12.18.423392,2,Stephan  Dorey,University of Reims Champagne Ardenne,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423392v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.18.423392v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1073/pnas.2101366118
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,153874,Bacteriophage infection produces membrane vesicles in Escherichia coli via both explosive cell lysis and membrane blebbing,"Membrane Vesicles (MVs) are membrane-bound spherical nanostructures that prevail in all three domains of life. In Gram-negative bacteria, MVs are thought to be produced through blebbing of the outer membrane and are often referred to as outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). We have recently described another mechanism of MV biogenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that involves explosive cell lysis events which shatters cellular membranes into fragments that rapidly anneal into MVs. Interestingly, MVs are often observed within preparations of lytic bacteriophage, however the source of these MVs and their association with bacteriophage infection has not been explored. In this study we aimed to determine if MV biogenesis is associated with lytic bacteriophage infection. Live super-resolution microscopy demonstrated that explosive cell lysis of E. coli cells infected with either bacteriophage T4 or T7, produced MVs derived from shattered membrane fragments. Infection by either bacteriophage was also associated with the formation of membrane blebs on intact bacteria. TEM revealed multiple classes of MVs within phage lysates, consistent with multiple mechanisms of MV biogenesis. These findings suggest that bacteriophage infection may be a major contributor to the abundance of bacterial MVs in nature.","Mandal, P. K.; Ballerin, G. B.; Nolan, L. M.; Petty, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,154049,Biofilm development on urinary catheters promotes the appearance of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria,"Catheter-associated urinary tract infections have serious consequences, both for patients and in impacting on healthcare resources. Much work has been carried out to develop an antimicrobial catheter. Although such developments have shown promise under laboratory conditions, none have demonstrated a clear advantage in clinical trials.

Using a range of microbiological and advanced microscopy techniques, a detailed laboratory study comparing biofilm development on silicone, hydrogel latex and silver alloy coated hydrogel latex catheters was carried out. Biofilm development by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis on three commercially available catheters was tracked over time. Samples were examined with episcopic differential interference contrast (EDIC) microscopy, culture analysis and staining techniques to quantify viable but non-culturable (VBNC) bacteria.

Both qualitative and quantitative assessment found biofilms to develop rapidly on all three materials. EDIC microscopy revealed the rough surface topography of the materials. Differences between culture counts and quantification of total and dead cells demonstrated the presence of VBNC populations, where bacteria retain viability but are not metabolically active.

The use of non-culture based techniques showed the development of widespread VBNC populations. These VBNC populations were more evident on silver alloy coated hydrogel latex catheters, indicating a bacteriostatic effect at best. The laboratory tests reported here, that detect VBNC bacteria, allow more rigorous assessment of antimicrobial catheters offering an explanation for why there is often minimal benefit to patients.

IMPORTANCESeveral antimicrobial urinary catheter materials have been developed but, although laboratory studies may show a benefit, none have significantly improved clinical outcomes. The use of poorly designed laboratory testing and lack of consideration to the impact of VBNC populations may be responsible. While the presence of VBNC populations is becoming more widely reported, there remains a lack of understanding of the clinical impact or influence of exposure to antimicrobial products. This is the first study to investigate the impact of antimicrobial surface materials and the appearance of VBNC populations. This demonstrates how improved testing is needed prior to clinical trials uptake.","Wilks, S. A.; Koerfer, V. V.; Prieto, J. A.; Fader, M.; Keevil, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,155347,"Milieu matters: An in vitro wound milieu to recapitulate key features of, and probe new insights into, polymicrobial biofilms","Bacterial biofilms are a major cause of delayed wound healing. Consequently, the study of wound biofilms, particularly in host-relevant conditions, has gained importance. Most in vitro biofilm studies employ refined laboratory media to study biofilms, conditions that are not relevant to the infection state. To mimic the wound milieu, in vitro biofilm studies often incorporate serum or plasma in growth conditions, or employ clot or matrix-based biofilm models. While incorporating serum or plasma alone is a minimalistic approach, the more complex in vitro wound models are technically demanding, and poorly compatible with standard biofilm assays. Based on previous reports of clinical wound fluid composition, we have developed an in vitro wound milieu (IVWM) that includes, in addition to serum (to recapitulate wound fluid), matrix elements and biochemical factors. In comparison with Luria-Bertani broth and Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), the IVWM was used to study planktonic growth and biofilm features, including interspecies interactions, of common wound pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We demonstrate that the IVWM recapitulates widely reported in vivo biofilm features such as metabolic activity, increased antibiotic tolerance, 3D structure, and interspecies interactions for single- and co-species biofilms. Further, the IVWM is simple to formulate, uses laboratory-grade components, and is compatible with standard biofilm assays. Given this, it holds potential as a tractable approach to study wound biofilms under host-relevant conditions.","Kadam, S.; Vandana, M.; Bhide, D.; Ugale, R.; Tikhole, U.; Kaushik, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,156321,"Polygenic adaptation, clonal interference, and the evolution of mutators in experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations","In bacterial populations, switches in lifestyle from motile, planktonic growth to surface-grown biofilm is associated with persistence in both infections and non-clinical biofilms. Studies have identified the first steps of adaptation to biofilm growth but have yet to replicate the extensive genetic diversity observed in chronic infections or in the natural environment. We conducted a 90-day long evolution experiment with Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 in growth media that promotes biofilm formation in either planktonic culture or in a biofilm bead model. Surprisingly, all populations evolved extensive genetic diversity with hundreds of mutations maintained at intermediate frequencies, while fixation events were rare. Instead of the expected few beneficial mutations rising in frequency through successive sweeps, we observe a remarkable 40 genes with parallel mutations spanning both environments and often on coexisting genotypes within a population. Additionally, the evolution of mutator genotypes (mutS or mutL mutator alleles) that rise to high frequencies in as little as 25 days contribute to the extensive genetic variation and strong clonal interference. Parallelism in several transporters (including pitA, pntB, nosD, and pchF) indicate probable adaptation to the arginine media that becomes highly alkaline during growth. Further, genes involved in signal transduction (including gacS, aer2, bdlA, and PA14_71750) reflect likely adaptations to biofilm-inducing conditions. This experiment shows how extensive genetic and phenotypic diversity can arise and persist in microbial populations despite strong selection that would normally purge diversity.

ImportanceHow biodiversity arises and is maintained in clonally reproducing organisms like microbes remains unclear. Many models presume that beneficial genotypes will outgrow others and purge variation via selective sweeps. Environmental structure like biofilms may oppose this process and preserve variation. We tested this hypothesis by evolving P. aeruginosa populations in biofilm-promoting media for three months and found both adaptation and diversification that were mostly uninterrupted by fixation events that eliminate diversity. Genetic variation tended to be greater in lines grown using a bead model of biofilm growth but many lineages also persisted in planktonic lines. Convergent evolution affecting dozens of genes indicates that selection acted on a wide variety of traits to improve fitness, causing many adapting lineages to co-occur and persist. This result demonstrates that some environments may expose a large fraction of the genome to selection and select for many adaptations at once, causing enduring diversity.","Harris, K. B.; Flynn, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,156318,O-specific antigen-dependent surface hydrophobicity mediates aggregate assembly type in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria live in spatially organized aggregates during chronic infections, where they adapt to the host environment, evade immune responses and resist therapeutic interventions. Although it is known that environmental factors such as polymers influence bacterial aggregation, it is not clear how bacterial adaptation during chronic infection impacts the formation and spatial organization of aggregates in the presence of polymers. Here we show that in an in vitro model of cystic fibrosis (CF) containing the polymers eDNA and mucin, O-specific antigen is a major factor in determining the formation of two distinct aggregate assembly types of Pseudomonas aeruginosa due to alterations in cell surface hydrophobicity. Our findings suggest that during chronic infection, interplay between cell surface properties and polymers in the environment may influence the formation and structure of bacterial aggregates, which would shed new light on the fitness costs and benefits of O-antigen production in environments such as CF lungs.

ImportanceDuring chronic infection, several factors contribute to the biogeography of microbial communities. Heterogeneous populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa form aggregates in cystic fibrosis airways, however, the impact of this population heterogeneity on spatial organization and aggregate assembly is not well understood. In this study we found that changes in O-specific antigen determine the spatial organization of P. aeruginosa cells by altering the relative cell surface hydrophobicity. This finding suggests a role for O-antigen in regulating P. aeruginosa aggregate size and shape in cystic fibrosis airways.","Azimi, S.; Thomas, J.; Cleland, S.; Curtis, J. E.; Goldberg, J.

Mechanisms underlying the conversion are not understood, but are of intense interest because of the ARDS-induced mortality in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Here, by optical imaging of live lungs we show that key to the lethality is the functional status of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering across the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in the lungs alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), which protect alveolar stability. In mice subjected to ARDS by airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, there was marked loss of MCU expression in AT2. The ability of mice to survive ARDS depended on the extent to which the MCU expression recovered, indicating that the viability of Ca2+ buffering by AT2 mitochondria critically determines ARDS severity. Mitochondrial transfer to enhance AT2 MCU expression might protect against ARDS.","Islam, M. N.; Gusarova, G. A.; Das, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157095,Biochemical and Structural Characterization of Two Cif-Like Epoxide Hydrolases from Burkholderia cenocepacia,"Epoxide hydrolases catalyze the conversion of epoxides to vicinal diols in a range of cellular processes such as signaling, detoxification, and virulence. These enzymes typically utilize a pair of tyrosine residues to orient the substrate epoxide ring in the active site and stabilize the hydrolysis intermediate. A new subclass of epoxide hydrolases that utilize a histidine in place of one of the tyrosines was established with the discovery of the CFTR Inhibitory Factor (Cif) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Although the presence of such Cif-like epoxide hydrolases was predicted in other opportunistic pathogens based on sequence analyses, only Cif and its homologue aCif from Acinetobacter nosocomialis have been characterized. Here we report the biochemical and structural characteristics of Cfl1 and Cfl2, two Cif-like epoxide hydrolases from Burkholderia cenocepacia. Cfl1 is able to hydrolyze xenobiotic as well as biological epoxides that might be encountered in the environment or during infection. In contrast, Cfl2 shows very low activity against a diverse set of epoxides. The crystal structures of the two proteins reveal quaternary structures that build on the well-known dimeric assembly of the /{beta} hydrolase domain, but broaden our understanding of the structural diversity encoded in novel oligomer interfaces. Analysis of the interfaces reveals both similarities and key differences in sequence conservation between the two assemblies, and between the canonical dimer and the novel oligomer interfaces of each assembly. Finally, we discuss the effects of these higher-order assemblies on the intra-monomer flexibility of Cfl1 and Cfl2 and their possible roles in regulating enzymatic activity.","Taher, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157217,Actin fence therapy with exogenous V12Rac1 protects against Acute Lung Injury,"High mortality in Acute Lung Injury (ALI) results from sustained proinflammatory signaling by alveolar receptors, such as TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1). Factors that determine the sustained signaling are not known. Unexpectedly, optical imaging of live alveoli revealed a major TNF-induced surge of alveolar TNFR1 due to a Ca2+-dependent mechanism that decreased the cortical actin fence. Mouse mortality due to inhaled LPS was associated with cofilin activation, actin loss and the TNFR1 surge. The constitutively active form of the GTPase, Rac1 (V12Rac1), given intranasally as a non-covalent construct with a cell-permeable peptide, enhanced alveolar F-actin and blocked the TNFR1 surge. V12Rac1 also protected against ALI-induced mortality resulting from intranasal (i.n.) instillation of LPS, or of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We propose a new therapeutic paradigm in which actin enhancement by exogenous Rac1 strengthens the alveolar actin fence, protecting against proinflammatory receptor hyperexpression, hence blocking ALI.","Gusarova, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157319,Emergence of XDR high-risk Pseudomonas aeruginosa ST309 in South America: a global comparative genomic analysis,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been considered one of the major nosocomial pathogens associated with elevated morbidity and mortality worldwide. Outbreaks have been associated with few high-risk pandemic P. aeruginosa lineages, presenting a remarkable antimicrobial resistance. However, the biological features involved with the persistence and spread of such lineages among clinical settings remain to be unravel. This study reports the emergence of the ST309 P. aeruginosa lineage in South America/Brazil, more precisely, in the Amazon region. Global genomic analyses were performed with the Brazilian strain (PA834) and more 41 complete and draft ST309 genomes publicly available, giving insights about ST309 epidemiology and its resistome and mobilome. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests revealed that the Brazilian PA834 strain presented the XDR phenotype, which was mainly due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Genomic analyses revealed a heterogeneous distribution of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes among ST309 genomes, which included blaVIM-2, blaIMP-15 and qnrVC1, all of them associated with class 1 integrons. The mobilome mining showed the presence of Integrative and Conjugative Elements, transposons and genomic islands harbouring a huge arsenal of hevy metal resistance genes. Moreover, these elements also carried genes involved with virulence and adaptive traits. Therefore, the presence of such genes in ST309 lineage possibly accounted for the global spread and persistence of this emerging clone, and for its establishment as a pandemic lineage of clinical importance.","Fonseca, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157559,Inhibition of Quorum Sensing System in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Psammaplin A and Bisaprasin Isolated from the Marine Sponge Aplysinella rhax,"Natural products isolated from marine sponges have exhibited profound bioactivity and, in some cases, serve as potent quorum sensing inhibitory agents by preventing microbial biofilm formation. In this study, the inhibitory potential of the psammaplin type compounds, psammaplin A (1) and bisaprasin (2), isolated from the marine sponge, Aplysinella rhax, was evaluated in the quorum-sensing inhibitory assay based on the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 lasB-gfp and P. aeruginosa PAO1 rhlA-gfp biosensor strains. The result indicated that psammaplin A (1) showed moderate inhibition against lasB-gfp biosensor strains but significantly inhibited the QS-gene promoters, rhlA-gfp with IC50 value at 30.69 and 2.64 M, respectively. In contrast, bisaprasin (2) displayed significant inhibition for both biosensor strains, lasB-gfp and rhlA-gfp with IC50 values at 8.70 and 8.53 M, respectively. To our knowledge, the antiquorum sensing activity of these marine-derived bromotyrosine compounds is described here for the first time.

Significance and Impact of the StudyThe attention of the scientific community has been drawn to using marine sources to find novel quorum sensing inhibitors as antipathogenic drugs to combat antimicrobial resistance and pathogenesis caused by the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria mediated by the quorum sensing (QS) system. By blocking the QS signalling communication, the ability to assemble an organised community structure that enables drug resistance and production of virulence factors will be attenuated. The significance of this investigation is based on the discovery of bromotyrosine derivatives as potential new drug leads for the development of antipathogenic agents.","Oluwabusola, E. T.; Tan, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157912,Commercial porcine gastric mucin contributes to variation in production of small molecule virulence factors by Pseudomonas aeruginosa when cultured in different formulations of artificial sputum medium,"Site-specific in vitro culture media are being developed to investigate microbial pathogenicity and ecology in nutrient environments that are more reflective of disease. For microbial ecology research in cystic fibrosis (CF), different artificial sputum media (ASM) formulations have been created to recapitulate the nutrient availability of the CF lung environment. However, these ASM formulations vary in concentration of amino acids, mucin, and other niche-specific compounds. Here, we measured the differential production of small molecule virulence factors by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the predominant pathogen in CF pulmonary infections, cultured in nine different ASM formulations via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and molecular networking. We show that different ASM formulations lead to different phenotypes and metabolic profiles of P. aeruginosa and commercial porcine gastric mucin (PGM) contains a myriad of contaminants, including iron, which affect P. aeruginosa physiology.

IMPORTANCEDifferent media formulations aiming to replicate in vivo infection environments contain different nutrients, which affects interpretation of experimental results. Inclusion of undefined components, such as commercial porcine gastric mucin (PGM), in an otherwise chemically defined medium can alter the nutrient content of the medium in unexpected ways and influence experimental outcomes.","Neve, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,157881,Mechanotaxis directs Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility.,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa explores surfaces using twitching motility powered by retractile extracellular filaments called type IV pili. Single cells twitch by successive pili extension, attachment and retraction. However, whether and how single cells control twitching migration remains unclear. We discovered that P. aeruginosa actively directs twitching in the direction of mechanical input from type IV pili, in a process we call mechanotaxis. The Chp chemotaxis-like system controls the balance of forward and reverse twitching migration of single cells in response to the mechanical signal. On surfaces, Chp senses type IV pili attachment at one pole thereby sensing a spatially-resolved signal. As a result, the Chp response regulators PilG and PilH control the polarization of the extension motor PilB. PilG stimulates polarization favoring forward migration, while PilH inhibits polarization inducing reversal. Subcellular segregation of PilG and PilH efficiently orchestrates their antagonistic functions, ultimately enabling rapid reversals upon perturbations. This distinct localization of response regulators establishes a signaling landscape known as local-excitation, global-inhibition in higher order organisms, identifying a conserved strategy to transduce spatially-resolved signals. Our discovery finally resolves the function of the Chp system and expands our view of the signals regulating motility.","Tala, L.; Kuhn, M.; Inclan, Y.; Patino, R.; Pierrat, X.; Vos, I.; Al-Mayyah, Z.; Macmillan, H.; Negrete, J.; Engel, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,158127,Ecology drives the evolution of diverse siderophore-production strategies in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria often cooperate by secreting molecules that can be shared as public goods between cells. Because the production of public goods is subject to cheating by mutants that exploit the good without contributing to it, there has been great interest in elucidating the evolutionary forces that maintain cooperation. However, little is known on how bacterial cooperation evolves under conditions where cheating is unlikely of importance. Here we use experimental evolution to follow changes in the production of a model public good, the iron-scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After 1200 generations of evolution in nine different environments, we observed that cheaters only reached high frequency in liquid medium with low iron availability. Conversely, when adding iron to reduce the cost of producing pyoverdine, we observed selection for pyoverdine hyper-producers. Similarly, hyper-producers also spread in populations evolved in highly viscous media, where relatedness between interacting individuals is higher. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed that hyper-production is associated with mutations/deletions in genes encoding quorum-sensing communication systems, while cheater clones had mutations in the iron-starvation sigma factor or in pyoverdine biosynthesis genes. Our findings demonstrate that bacterial social traits can evolve rapidly in divergent directions, with particularly strong selection for increased levels of cooperation occurring in environments where individual dispersal is reduced, as predicted by social evolution theory. Moreover, we establish a regulatory link between pyoverdine production and quorum-sensing, showing that increased cooperation at one trait (pyoverdine) can be associated with the loss (quorum-sensing) of another social trait.","Figueiredo, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,158577,A Fast Lasso-based Method for Inferring Pairwise Interactions,"AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alternations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify pairwise gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Existing computational tools which account for epistasis do not scale to human exome-wide screens and struggle with genetically diverse bacterial species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combining earlier work in interaction detection with recent advances in integer compression, we present a method for epistatic interaction detection on sparse (human) exome-scale data, and an R implementation in the package Pint. Our method takes advantage of sparsity in the input data and recent progress in integer compression to perform lasso-penalised linear regression on all pairwise combinations of the input, estimating up to 200 million potential effects, including epistatic interactions. Hence the human exome is within the reach of our method, assuming one parameter per gene and one parameter per epistatic effect for every pair of genes. We demonstrate Pint on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens.","Elmes, K.; Heywood, A.; Huang, Z.; Gavryushkin, A.",2021-02-01,Bioinformatics,10.1101/2021.01.28.428698,2,Alex  Gavryushkin,University of Otago,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428698v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.28.428698v2.full.pdf,,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,158450,Hyperpiliation reduces Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity by impeding type III secretion,"Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important virulence factors for many bacterial pathogens. Previous studies suggested that the retraction ATPase, PilT, modulates pathogenicity due to its critical role in pilus dynamics and twitching motility. Here we use a Caenorhabditis elegans slow killing model to show that hyperpiliation, not loss of pilus retraction, reduces virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAK and PA14 by interfering with function of the contact-dependent type III secretion system (T3SS). Hyperactivating point mutations in the P. aeruginosa PilSR two-component system that controls transcription of the major pilin gene, pilA, increased levels of surface pili to the same extent as deleting pilT, without impairing twitching motility. These functionally hyperpiliated PilSR mutants had significant defects in pathogenicity that were rescued by deleting pilA or by increasing the length of T3SS needles via deletion of the needle-length regulator, PscP. Hyperpiliated pilT deletion or pilO point mutants showed similar PilA-dependent impairments in virulence, validating the phenotype. Together, our data support a model where a surfeit of pili prevents effective engagement of contact-dependent virulence factors. These findings suggest that the role of T4aP retraction in virulence should be revised.

SIGNIFICANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections and particularly problematic due to its intrinsic resistance to many front-line antibiotics. Strategies to combat this and other important pathogens include development of anti-virulence therapeutics. We show that the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa is impaired when the amount of type IVa pili (T4aP) expressed on the cell surface increases, independent of the bacterias ability to twitch. We propose that having excess T4aP on the cell surface can physically interfere with productive engagement of the contact-dependent type III secretion toxin delivery system. A better understanding of how T4aP modulate interaction of bacteria with target cells will improve the design of therapeutics targeting components involved in regulation of T4aP expression and function, to reduce the clinical burden of P. aeruginosa and other T4aP-expressing bacteria.","Kilmury, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,158453,The DEAD-box RNA helicases RhlE2 is a global regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lifestyle and pathogenesis,"The RhlE DEAD-box RNA helicase protein family is widespread among Proteobacteria, but it is the least understood due to the lack of a clear biological function. Here, we study the two RhlE homologs present in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RhlE1 and RhlE2 diverged during P. aeruginosa evolution; our data indicate that this resulted in a non-redundant biological role, a distinct molecular action and an enzymatic activity differentially stimulated by RNA. Whereas RhlE1 is specifically necessary for bacteria growth in cold, we show that RhlE2 acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts and multiple functionalities indispensable not only for P. aeruginosa environmental adaptation, but also for its virulence. The global action of RhlE2 relies on a unique C-terminal extension, which establishes an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery.","Hausmann, S.; Gonzalez, D.; Geiser, J.; Valentini, M.",2021-01-30,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.01.29.428592,2,Martina  Valentini,University of Geneva,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.428592v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.428592v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1093/nar/gkab503
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,158449,From heterogeneity to homogeneity: coordination of siderophore gene expression among clonal cells of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"There has been great progress in understanding how bacterial groups coordinate social actions, such as biofilm formation, swarming and public-goods secretion. Less clear, however, is whether the seemingly coordinated responses observed at the group level actually mirror what individual cells do. Here, we use a microscopy approach to simultaneously quantify the investment of individual cells of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa into two public goods, the siderophores pyochelin and pyoverdine. Using gene expression as a proxy for investment, we initially observed no coordination but high heterogeneity and bimodality in siderophore gene expression across cells. With increasing cell density, gene expression became homogenized across cells, accompanied by a shift from pyochelin to pyoverdine expression. We found positive correlations in the expression of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes across cells, and show that cell-to-cell variation is driven by differences in cellular metabolic states. We propose a model explaining how variation in internal iron stocks can spur initial erratic gene expression, while siderophore-mediated signalling and intra-cellular feedbacks later on can induce highly coordinated gene expression and synchronized shifts from pyochelin to pyoverdine. Our work provides new insights into bacterial collective decision-making processes and reveals a three-phase chronobiological siderophore investment cycle in P. aeruginosa.","Mridha, S.; Kuemmerli, R.",2021-01-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.01.29.428812,1,Rolf  Kuemmerli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.428812v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.29.428812v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

There were seven major terpenoid compounds in the leaf extracts, including 2 monoterpenes of camphor and L-borneol, and 5 sesquiterpenes of silphiperfol-5-ene, 7-epi-silphiperfol-5-ene, {beta}-caryophyllene, {ramshorn}-eudesmol, and -eudesmol. Different hydrodistillation periods resulted in different quantitates and compositions of the terpenoids in EOs. The yield of EOs from the immature leaves was 1.4 times higher than the mature ones, whereas 73% of the yield was collected from the first 6 h of hydrodistillation. Camphor and L-borneol were almost collected in the first 6 h, while {beta}-caryophyllene, silphiperfolene, and 7-epi-silphiperfolene were above 80%, but {ramshorn}-eudesmol and -eudesmol were only 32 and 54% released. {beta}-Caryophyllene, {ramshorn}-eudesmol, and -eudesmol were found higher in the mature leaf EOs. Antioxidant capacities in EOs were positively related to terpenoid contents. Antibacterial activity of EOs from the immature leaves was subsequently tested. Although EOs from the hydrodistillation period of 12-18 h contained fewer terpenoid compositions, it showed the same minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) on Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, compared to 0-6 h EOs.","Jirakitticharoen, S.; Wisuitiprot, W.; Jitareerat, P.; Wongs-Aree, C.",2021-02-01,Plant Biology,10.1101/2021.02.01.429126,1,Chalermchai  Wongs-Aree,King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.429126v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.429126v1.full.pdf,,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,159304,The promiscuous and highly mobile resistome of a superbug.,"Antimicrobial resistance (AR) is a major global threat to public health. Understanding the population dynamics of AR is critical to restrain and control this issue. However, no study has provided a global picture of the resistome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a very important nosocomial pathogen. Here we analyze 1450+ genomes (covering > 40 countries and > 4 decades) to infer the global population dynamics of the resistome of this species. We show that gene flow and horizontal transfer have driven the dissemination of AR genes in A. baumannii. We found considerable variation in AR gene content across lineages. Although the individual AR gene histories have been affected by recombination, the AR gene content has been shaped by the phylogeny. Furthermore, many AR genes have been transferred to other well-known pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Finally, despite using this massive data set, we were not able to sample the whole diversity of AR genes, which suggests that this species has an open resistome. Ours results highlight the high mobilization risk of AR genes between important pathogens. On a broader perspective, this study gives a framework for an emerging perspective (resistome-centric) on the genome epidemiology (and surveillance) of bacterial pathogens.","Hernandez-Gonzalez, I.; Mateo-Estrada, V.; Castillo-Ramirez, S.",2021-02-03,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.02.03.429652,1,Santiago  Castillo-Ramirez,"Programa de Genomica Evolutiva, Centro de Ciencias Genomicas, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cuernavaca, Mexico",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.429652v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.03.429652v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,159798,"The ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adopt a Small Colony Variant (SCV) phenotype is conserved, and not restricted to clinical isolates","A subpopulation of Small Colony Variants (SCVs) is a frequently observed feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs biofilms. SCVs have almost exclusively been reported from infected hosts, essentially CF individuals or, by extension, from laboratory cultivation of strains originated from infected hosts. We previously reported the identification of P. aeruginosa SCVs emerging from a non-clinical strain and displaying features shared with clinical SCVs. In the present work, we investigated the ability of 22 P. aeruginosa isolates from various environmental origins to, under laboratory culture conditions, spontaneously adopt a SCV-like smaller alternative morphotype distinguishable from the ancestral parent strain. Unexpectedly, we found that all the P. aeruginosa strains tested have the ability to adopt a SCV morphotype, regardless of their origin. Based on the phenotypes already described for SCVs, the SCV-like morphotypes obtained were clustered in two groups displaying various phenotypic profiles, including one characteristic of already described SCVs. We conclude that the ability to switch to a SCV phenotype is a conserved feature in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEP. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in many environments. It is significant public health concern, notably because it is the most prevalent pathogen found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). In infected hosts, its persistence is believed to be related to the emergence of an alternative small colony variant (SCV) phenotype. By reporting the distribution of P. aeruginosa SCVs in various non-clinical environments, this work contributes to understanding a conserved adaptation mechanism used by P. aeruginosa to rapidly adapt in all environments. Counteraction of this strategy could prevent P. aeruginosa persistent infection in the future.","Besse, A.; Trottier, M.; Groleau, M.-C.; Deziel, E.",2021-02-08,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.02.05.430018,1,Eric  Déziel,INRS-Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.430018v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.430018v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,159943,Architecture of cell-cell junctions in situ reveals a mechanism for bacterial biofilm inhibition,"Many bacteria, including the major human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are naturally found in multicellular, antibiotic-tolerant biofilm communities, where cells are embedded in an extracellular matrix of polymeric molecules. Cell-cell interactions within P. aeruginosa biofilms are mediated by CdrA, a large, membrane-associated adhesin present in the extracellular matrix of biofilms, regulated by the cytoplasmic concentration of cyclic diguanylate. Here, using electron cryotomography of focused-ion beam milled specimens, we report the architecture of CdrA molecules in the extracellular matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms at intact cell-cell junctions. Combining our in situ observations at cell-cell junctions with biochemistry, native mass spectrometry and cellular imaging, we demonstrate that CdrA forms an extended structure that projects from the outer membrane to tether cells together via polysaccharide binding partners. We go on to show the functional importance of CdrA using custom single-domain antibody (nanobody) binders. Nanobodies targeting the tip of functional cell-surface CdrA molecules could be used to inhibit bacterial biofilm formation or disrupt pre-existing biofilms in conjunction with bactericidal antibiotics. These results reveal a functional mechanism for cell-cell interactions within bacterial biofilms and highlight the promise of using inhibitors targeting biofilm cell-cell junctions to prevent or treat problematic, chronic bacterial infections.","Melia, C.; Bolla, J.

Translation of both OLGs was confirmed by ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomics of samples taken during different phases of growth revealed regulation of protein abundances, implying biological functionality. Both OLGs are taxonomically highly restricted, and likely arose by overprinting within the genus. Evidence for purifying selection further supports functionality.

During an emergency (man-made, natural disaster, or pandemic), the etiology of infection might be unknown at the time of patient treatment. The existing local or global Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs might not be fully prepared for emerging/re-emerging infectious disease outbreaks, especially if they are caused by an unknown organism, engineered bioterrorist attack, or rapidly evolving superbug. We demonstrate an antimicrobial efficacy profiling method that can be performed in hours directly from clinical urine specimens. The antimicrobial potency is determined by the microbial growth inhibition and compared to conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results. The oligonucleotide probe pairs on the sensor were designed to target gram-negative bacteria, specifically Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A total of 10 remnant clinical specimens from the CLIA labs of New York-Presbyterian Queens were tested, resulting in 100% categorical agreement with reference AST methods (Vitek and broth microdilution method). The combined categorical susceptibility reporting of 12 contrived urine specimens was 100% for ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and meropenem over a range of microbial loads from 105 to 108 CFU/mL.","Chen, J.; San, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,160910,Trade-offs between antiseptic cytotoxicity and efficacy in a human ex vivo wound contamination model,"Wound cleansing agents are routine in wound care, even in the absence of signs of infection. Antiseptic activity prevents contaminating microbes from establishing an infection while also raising concerns of cytotoxicity and delayed wound healing. Here, we used an ex vivo human skin excisional wound model to evaluate the cytotoxicity of five clinically-used wound cleaning agents (saline, povidone iodine, Dove(R) soap, Dial(R) soap, and chlorhexidine gluconate). We established a wound contamination model using [~]100 cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa per wound to evaluate antiseptic efficacy and microbial biofilm spatial organization. We found that Dial(R) soap and chlorhexidine gluconate significantly reduced metabolic activity of the biopsies, while all treatments except saline affected local cellular viability. Within the contamination model, only chlorhexidine gluconate treatment resulted in significantly lower P. aeruginosa counts at 24 hours post-treatment, driven by sub-limit-of-detection counts immediately post-treatment. Later applications of chlorhexidine gluconate had no effects on microbial growth, with microscopy showing extensive surface colonization of the wound bed. We present a clinically-relevant model for evaluating antiseptic cytotoxicity and efficacy, with the ability to resolve spatial localization and temporal dynamics of tissue viability and microbial growth.","Cheong, A.; Liu, A.; Rust, C.; Kalan, L.; Gibson, A.",2021-02-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.02.14.430155,1,Lindsay  Kalan,University of Wisconsin-Madison,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.14.430155v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.14.430155v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,161453,Capturing actively produced microbial volatile organic compounds from human associated samples with vacuum assisted sorbent extraction,"Volatile organic compounds (VOC) from biological samples have unknown origins. VOCs may originate from the host or different microbial organisms from a microbial community. In order to disentangle the origin of microbial VOCs, we performed volatile headspace analysis of bacterial mono- and co-cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, and stable isotope probing in biological samples of feces, saliva, sewage, and sputum. We utilized mono- and co-cultures to identify volatile production from individual bacterial species or in combination with stable isotope probing to identify the active metabolism of microbes from the biological samples. To extract the VOCs, we employed vacuum assisted sorbent extraction (VASE). VASE is an easy-to-use commercialized solvent-free headspace extraction method for semi-volatile and volatile compounds. The lack of solvents and the near vacuum conditions used make developing a method relatively easy and fast when compared to other extraction options like tert-butylation and solid phase microextraction. However, VASE does not work on nonvolatile compounds, thus excluding many protein analyses and heavy stable isotope labelling experiments. Using the workflow described here, we identified volatile signatures from mono- and co-cultures indicating there were volatiles specific to certain microbes or co-cultures. Furthermore, analysis of the stable isotope probing of biological samples identified VOCs that were either commonly or uniquely produced from the different human derived biological samples. Here we present the general workflow and experimental considerations of VASE.

SUMMARYFrom this protocol, readers will be able to extract volatile organic compounds from a biological sample with the vacuum assisted sorbent extraction method, run samples on a GC-MS with the use of the Entech autosampler, and analyze data.","Phan, J.; Kapcia, J.; Rodriguez, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,161346,F-type Pyocins are Diverse Non-Contractile Phage Tail-Like Weapons for Killing Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Most Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains produce bacteriocins derived from contractile or non-contractile phage tails known as R-type and F-type pyocins, respectively. These bacteriocins possess strain-specific bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa and likely increase evolutionary fitness through intraspecies competition. R-type pyocins have been studied extensively and show promise as alternatives to antibiotics. Although they have similar therapeutic potential, experimental studies on F-type pyocins are limited. Here, we provide a bioinformatic and experimental investigation of F-type pyocins. We introduce a systematic naming scheme for genes found in R- and F-type pyocin operons and identify 15 genes invariably found in strains producing F-type pyocins. Five proteins encoded at the 3-end of the F-type pyocin cluster are divergent in sequence, and likely determine bactericidal specificity. We use sequence similarities among these proteins to define 11 distinct F-type pyocin groups, five of which had not been previously described. The five genes encoding the variable proteins associate in two modules that have clearly re-assorted independently during the evolution of these operons. These proteins are considerably more diverse than the specificity-determining tail fibers of R-type pyocins, suggesting that F-type pyocins emerged earlier or have been subject to distinct evolutionary pressures. Experimental studies on six F-type pyocin groups show that each displays a distinct spectrum of bactericidal activity. This activity is strongly influenced by the lipopolysaccharide O-antigen type, but other factors also play a role. F-type pyocins appear to kill as efficiently as R-type pyocins. These studies set the stage for the development of F-type pyocins as anti-bacterial therapeutics.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a broad spectrum of antibiotic resistant infections with high mortality rates, particularly in immunocompromised individuals and cystic fibrosis patients. Due to the increasing frequency of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections, there is great interest in the development of alternative therapeutics. One alternative is protein-based antimicrobials called bacteriocins, which are produced by one strain of bacteria to kill other strains. In this study, we investigate F-type pyocins, bacteriocins naturally produced by P. aeruginosa that resemble non-contractile phage tails. We show that they are potent killers of P. aeruginosa, and distinct pyocin groups display different killing specificities. We have identified the probable specificity determinants of F-type pyocins, which opens up the potential to engineer them to precisely target strains of pathogenic bacteria. The resemblance of F-type pyocins to well characterized phage tails will greatly facilitate their development into effective antibacterials.","Saha, S.; Ojobor, C.; Mackinnon, E.; North, O.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa expresses a phospholipase, ExoU that triggers pathological host cell necrosis through a poorly characterized pathway. Here, we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ExoU-mediated necrosis. We show that cellular peroxidised phospholipids enhance ExoU phospholipase activity, which drives necrosis of immune and non-immune cells. Conversely, both the endogenous lipid peroxidation regulator GPX4 and the pharmacological inhibition of lipid peroxidation delay ExoU-dependent cell necrosis and improve bacterial elimination in vitro and in vivo. Our findings also pertain to the ExoU-related phospholipase from the bacterial pathogen Burkholderia thailandensis, suggesting that exploitation of peroxidised phospholipids might be a conserved virulence mechanism among various microbial phospholipases. Overall, our results identify an original lipid peroxidation-based virulence mechanism as a strong contributor of microbial phospholipase-driven pathology.","Bagayoko, S.; Leon-Icaza, S.-A.; Pinilla, M.; Hessel, A.; Santoni, K.; Bordignon, P.-J.; Moreau, F.; Eren, E.; Boyance, A.; Naser, E.; Lefevre, L.; Berrone, C.; Iacobachvili, N.; Metais, A.; Rombouts, Y.; Coste, A.; Attree, I.; Frank, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,161542,A D-2-hydroxyglutarate biosensor based on specific transcriptional regulator DhdR,"D-2-Hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) is a metabolite in many physiological metabolic processes. When D-2-HG is aberrantly accumulated due to mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenases or D-2-HG dehydrogenase, it functions in a pro-oncogenic manner and is thus considered a therapeutic target and biomarker in many cancers. In this study, DhdR from Achromobacter denitrificans NBRC 15125 was identified as an allosteric transcription factor that negatively regulates D-2-HG dehydrogenase expression and responds to presence of D-2-HG. It is the first known transcription regulator specifically responding to D-2-HG across all domains of life. Based on the allosteric effect of DhdR, a D-2-HG biosensor was developed by combining DhdR with amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay technology. The biosensor was able to detect D-2-HG in serum, urine, and cell culture with high specificity and sensitivity. Additionally, this biosensor was also successfully used to identify the role of D-2-HG metabolism in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, demonstrating its broad usages.","Xiao, D.; Zhang, W.; Guo, X.; Liu, Y.; Hu, C.; Guo, S.; Kang, Z.; Xu, X.; Ma, C.; Gao, C.; Xu, P.",2021-02-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.02.18.430539,1,Chao  Gao,"State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, People's Republic of China",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.430539v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.430539v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41467-021-23723-7

The increasing emergence of multidrug resistant infections has led to the resurgent interest in bacteriophages as an alternative treatment. Current procedures assessing susceptibility and breadth of host range to bacteriophage are conducted using large-scale manual processes that are labor-intensive. The aim here was to establish and validate a scaled down methodology for high-throughput screening in order to reduce procedural footprint. Bacteriophages were isolated from wastewater samples and screened for specificity against 29 clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and PA01 using a spot test (2 L/ drop). Host range assessment was performed on four representative P. aeruginosa isolates using both double agar overlay assay on petri dishes and 24-well culture plates. The breadth of host range of bacteriophages that exhibited lytic activity on P. aeruginosa isolates were corroborated between the current standard practice of whole plate phage assay and 24-well phage assay.

Here, we have developed a nanoceutical cotton fabric duly sensitized with non-toxic zinc oxide nanomaterial for potential use as membrane filter in the one way valve for the ease of breathing without the threat of COVID-19 spreading. A detailed computational study revealed that zinc oxide nanoflowers (ZnO NF) with almost two-dimensional petals trap SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, responsible to attach to ACE-2 receptors in human lung epithelial cells. The study also confirm significant denaturation of the spike proteins on the ZnO surface, revealing removal of virus upon efficient trapping. Following the computational study, we have synthesized ZnO NF on cotton matrix using hydrothermal assisted strategy. Electron microscopic, steady-state and picosecond resolved spectroscopic studies confirm attachment of ZnO NF to the cotton (i.e., cellulose) matrix at atomic level to develop the nanoceutical fabric. A detailed antimicrobial assay using Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria (model SARS-CoV-2 mimic) reveals excellent anti-microbial efficiency of the developed nanoceutical fabric. To our understanding the novel nanoceutical fabric used in one-way valve of a face mask would be the choice to assure breathing comfort along with source control of COVID-19 infection.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,162155,Frequency of quorum sensing mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from different environments,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate the expression of multiple genes necessary for establishing and maintaining infection. It has previously been shown that lasR QS mutations frequently arise in cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections, however, there has been far less emphasis on determining whether other QS system mutations arise during infection or in other environments. To test this, we utilized 852 publicly available sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes from the Pseudomonas International Consortium Database (IPCD) to study P. aeruginosa QS mutational signatures. To study isolates by source, we focused on a subset of 654 isolates collected from CF, wounds, and non-infection environmental isolates, where we could clearly identify their source. We also worked a small collection of isolates in vitro to determine the impact of lasR and pqs mutations on isolate phenotypes. We found that lasR mutations are common across all environments and are not specific to infection nor a particular infection type. We also found that the pqs system proteins PqsA, PqsH, PqsL and MexT, a protein of increasing importance to the QS field, are highly variable. Conversely, RsaL, a negative transcriptional regulator of the las system, was found to be highly conserved, suggesting selective pressure to repress las system activity. Overall, our findings suggest that QS mutations in P. aeruginosa are common and not limited to the las system; however, LasR is unique in the frequency of putative loss-of-function mutations.","O'connor, K.; Zhao, C.

The growth rate of the bacteria and the rate of formation of biofilm on each urinary catheter was determined by preparing biofilm assays, ranking them using crystal violet satins and measuring their absorbance using UV-VIS spectrophotometer. A difference in the level of biofilm in the catheters were observed. The differences in the level of biofilm observed in the catheters imply that different catheters may have different susceptibility for the formation of biofilms.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,162752,Calprotectin-mediated zinc chelation inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa protease activity in cystic fibrosis sputum,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces pathways indicative of low zinc availability in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung environment. To learn more about P. aeruginosa zinc access in CF, we grew P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 directly in expectorated CF sputum. The P. aeruginosa Zur transcriptional repressor controls the response to low intracellular zinc, and we used the NanoString methodology to monitor levels of Zur-regulated transcripts including those encoding a zincophore system, a zinc importer, and paralogs of zinc containing proteins that do not require zinc for activity. Zur-controlled transcripts were induced in sputum-grown P. aeruginosa compared to control cultures, but not if the sputum was amended with zinc. Amendment of sputum with ferrous iron did not reduce expression of Zur-regulated genes. A reporter fusion to a Zur-regulated promoter had variable activity in P. aeruginosa grown in sputum from different donors, and this variation inversely correlated with sputum zinc concentrations. Recombinant human calprotectin (CP), a divalent-metal binding protein released by neutrophils, was sufficient to induce a zinc-starvation response in P. aeruginosa grown in laboratory medium or zinc-amended CF sputum indicating that CP is functional in the sputum environment. Zinc metalloproteases comprise a large fraction of secreted zinc-binding P. aeruginosa proteins. Here we show that recombinant CP inhibited both LasB-mediated casein degradation and LasA-mediated lysis of Staphylococcus aureus, which was reversible with added zinc. These studies reveal the potential for CP-mediated zinc chelation to post-translationally inhibit zinc metalloprotease activity and thereby impact the protease-dependent physiology and/or virulence of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung environment.

ImportanceThe factors that contribute to worse outcomes in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are not well understood. Therefore, there is a need to understand environmental factors within the CF airway that contribute to P. aeruginosa colonization and infection. We demonstrate that growing bacteria in CF sputum induces a zinc-starvation response that inversely correlates with sputum zinc levels. Additionally, both calprotectin and a chemical zinc chelator inhibit the proteolytic activities of LasA and LasB proteases suggesting that extracellular zinc chelators can influence proteolytic activity and thus P. aeruginosa virulence and nutrient acquisition in vivo.","Vermilyea, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,163158,Disruption of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tat system perturbs PQS-dependent quorum sensing and biofilm maturation through loss of the Rieske cytochrome bc1 sub-unit,"Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is a major constituent of the extracellular matrix of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and its release is regulated via the pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) dependent quorum sensing (QS). By screening a P. aeruginosa transposon library to identify factors required for DNA release, mutants with insertions in the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway were identified as exhibiting reduced eDNA release, and defective biofilm architecture with enhanced susceptibility to tobramycin. P. aeruginosa tat mutants showed substantial reductions in pyocyanin, rhamnolipid and membrane vesicle (MV) production consistent with perturbation of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS) dependent QS as demonstrated by changes in pqsA expression and 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (AQ) production. Provision of exogenous PQS to the tat mutants did not return pqsA, rhlA or phzA1 expression or pyocyanin production to wild type levels. However, transformation of the tat mutants with the AQ-independent pqs effector pqsE restored phzA1 expression and pyocyanin production. Since mutation or inhibition of Tat prevented PQS-driven auto-induction, we sought to identify the Tat secretion substrate responsible. A pqsA::lux fusion was introduced into each of 34 validated P. aeruginosa Tat substrate deletion mutants. Analysis of each mutant for reduced bioluminescence revealed that the signalling defect was associated with the Rieske iron-sulfur subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex. In common with the parent strain, a Rieske mutant exhibited defective PQS signalling, AQ production, rhlA expression and eDNA release that could be restored by genetic complementation. Thus, lack of the Rieske sub-unit export is clearly responsible for the Tat-mediated perturbation of PQS-dependent QS, the loss of virulence factor production, biofilm eDNA and the tobramycin tolerance of P. aeruginosa biofilms.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly adaptable human pathogen responsible for causing chronic biofilm-associated infections. Biofilms are highly refractory to host defences and antibiotics and thus difficult to eradicate. The biofilm extracellular matrix incorporates extracellular DNA (eDNA). This stabilizes biofilm architecture and helps confer tolerance to antibiotics. Since mechanisms that control eDNA release are not well understood, we screened a P. aeruginosa mutant bank for strains with defects in eDNA release and discovered a role for the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway that exports folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Perturbation of the Tat pathway resulted in defective biofilms susceptible to antibiotic treatment as a consequence of perturbed pseudomonas quinolone (PQS) signalling. This resulted in the failure to produce or release biofilm components including eDNA, phenazines and rhamnolipids as well as microvesicles. Furthermore, we discovered that perturbation of PQS signalling was a consequence of the inability of tat mutants to translocate the Rieske subunit of the cytochrome bc1 complex involved in electron transfer and energy transduction. Given the importance of PQS signalling and the Tat system to virulence and biofilm maturation in P. aeruginosa, our findings underline the potential of the Tat system as a drug target for novel antimicrobial agents.","Soh, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,163462,Genome-wide identification of genetic requirements of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 for rat cardiomyocyte (H9C2) infection by insertion sequencing,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major infectious agent among Gram-negative bacteria which causes both acute and chronic infections without any tissue specificity. Infections due to P. aeruginosa are hard to treat, as it entails various strategies like virulence factors synthesis, drug efflux systems & resistance and protein secretion systems during pathogenesis. Despite extensive research in Pseudomonas pathogenesis, novel drug targets and potential therapeutic strategies are inevitable. In this study, we investigated the genetic requirements of P.aeruginosa PAO1 for rat cardiomyocyte (H9C2) infection by insertion sequencing (INSeq). A mutant library comprising ~70,000 mutants of PAO1 was generated and the differentiated form of H9C2 cells (d-H9C2) was infected with the library. The infected d-H9C2 cells were maintained with antibiotic-protection and without any antibiotics in the growth media for 24 h. Subsequently, DNA library for INSeq was prepared, sequenced and fitness analysis was performed. A-One hundred and thirteen mutants were negatively selected in the infection condition with antibiotic-protection, whereas 143 mutants were negatively selected in antibiotic-free condition. Surprisingly, a higher number of mutants showed enriched fitness than the mutants of reduced fitness during the infection. We demonstrated that the genes associated with flagella and T3SS are important for adhesion and invasion of cardiomyocytes, while pili and proteases are conditionally essential during host cell lysis.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,163467,"Novel anti-repression mechanism of H-NS proteins by a phage ""early protein"".","H-NS family proteins, bacterial xenogeneic silencers, play central roles in genome organization and in the regulation of foreign genes. It is thought that gene repression is directly dependent on the DNA binding modes of H-NS family proteins. These proteins form lateral protofilaments along DNA. Under specific environmental conditions they switch to bridging two DNA duplexes. This switching is a direct effect of environmental conditions on electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged DNA binding and N-terminal domains of H-NS proteins. The Pseudomonas lytic phage LUZ24 encodes the early protein gp4, which modulates the DNA binding and function of the H-NS family protein MvaT of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the mechanism by which gp4 modulates MvaT activity remains elusive. In this study, we show that gp4 specifically interferes with the formation and stability of the bridged MvaT-DNA complex. Structural investigations suggest that gp4 acts as an ""electrostatic zipper"" between the oppositely charged domains of MvaT protomers, and stabilizes a structure resembling their ""half-open"" conformation, resulting in relief of gene silencing and adverse effects on P. aeruginosa growth. The ability to control H-NS conformation and thereby its impact on global gene regulation and growth might open new avenues to fight Pseudomonas multidrug resistance.","Ben Bdira, F.; Qing, L.; Volkov, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,163912,Anaerobic microbiota facilitate P. aeruginosa access to airway epithelia in a novel co-culture model of colonization,"The role(s) of anaerobic microbiota in chronic airway disease are poorly understood due to inherent limitations of existing laboratory models. To address this knowledge gap, we use a dual oxic-anoxic co-culture approach that maintains an oxygen-limited apical epithelial microenvironment while host cells are oxygenated basolaterally. Reduced oxygen culture did not alter the physiology or gene expression of Calu-3 cells but supported anaerobe-epithelial interactions for 24h without affecting bacterial or host cell viability. Anaerobe challenge led to increased expression of inflammatory marker genes and compromised integrity of apical mucins, leading to our hypothesis that anaerobe-host interactions prime the airways for chronic infection. Indeed, anaerobe pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells led to an increase in Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. This model system offers new insight into anaerobe-host interactions in airway disease pathophysiology and motivates further study of the lung, gut, and oral cavity, where etiological roles of anaerobes have been proposed but specific pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear.","Moore, P.

We update the genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) of one such pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, through metabolic coverage expansion, format update, extensive annotation addition, and literature-based curation to produce iPau21. We then validate iPau21 through MEMOTE, growth rate, carbon source utilization, and gene essentiality testing to demonstrate its improved quality and predictive capabilities. We then integrate the GENRE with transcriptomic data in order to generate context-specific models of P. aeruginosa metabolism. The contextualized models recapitulated known phenotypes of unaltered growth and a differential utilization of fumarate metabolism, while also revealing an increased utilization of propionate metabolism upon MUC5B exposure. This work serves to validate iPau21 and demonstrate its utility for providing biological insights.","Payne, D. D.; Renz, A.; Dunphy, L. J.; Lewis, T.; Draeger, A.; Papin, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,165353,Amotosalen is a bacterial multidrug efflux pump substrate potentially affecting its pathogen inactivation activity,"Pathogen inactivation is a strategy to improve the safety of transfusion products. The Cerus Intercept technology makes use of a psoralen compound called amotosalen in combination with UVA light to inactivate bacteria, viruses and protozoa. Psoralens have structural similarity to bacterial multidrug-efflux pump substrates. As these efflux pumps are often overexpressed in multidrug-resistant pathogens and with recent reported outbreaks of transfusion-associated sepsis with Acinetobacter, we tested whether contemporary drug-resistant pathogens might show resistance to amotosalen and other psoralens based on multidrug efflux mechanisms through microbiological, biophysical and molecular modeling analysis. The main efflux systems in Enterobacterales and Acinetobacter baumannii, tripartite RND (resistance-nodulation-cell division) systems which span the inner and outer membranes of Gram-negative pathogens and expel antibiotics from the bacterial cytoplasm into the extracellular space, were specifically examined. We found that amotosalen was an efflux substrate for the TolC-dependent RND efflux pumps in E. coli and the AdeABC efflux pump from Acinetobacter baumannii, and that minimal inhibitory concentrations for contemporary bacterial isolates in vitro approached and exceeded the concentration of amotosalen used in the approved platelet and plasma inactivation procedures. These findings suggest that otherwise safe and effective inactivation methods should be further studied to exclude possible gaps in their ability to inactivate contemporary, multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.

ImportancePathogen inactivation is a strategy to enhance the safety of transfused blood products. We identify the compound, amotosalen, widely used for pathogen inactivation, as a bacterial multidrug efflux substrate. Specifically, experiments suggest that amotosalen is pumped out of bacteria by the major TolC-dependent RND efflux pumps in E. coli and the AdeABC efflux pump in Acinetobacter baumannii. Such efflux pumps are often overexpressed in multidrug-resistant pathogens. Importantly, the minimal inhibitory concentrations for contemporary multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia spp., and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates approached or exceeded the amotosalen concentration used in approved platelet and plasma inactivation procedures, potentially as a result of efflux pump activity. Although there are important differences in methodology between our experiments and blood product pathogen inactivation, these findings suggest that otherwise safe and effective inactivation methods should be further studied to exclude possible gaps in their ability to inactivate contemporary, multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.","Green, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,166326,Pseudomonas aeruginosa reaches collective decisions via transient segregation of quorum sensing activities across cells,"Bacteria engage in a cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate expression of cooperative exoproducts at the group level. While population-level QS-responses are well studied, we know little about commitments of single cells to QS. Here, we use flow cytometry to track the investment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa individuals into their intertwined Las and Rhl QS-systems. Using fluorescent reporters, we show that QS gene expression (signal synthase, receptor and exoproduct) was heterogenous and followed a gradual instead of a sharp temporal induction pattern. The simultaneous monitoring of two QS genes revealed that cells transiently segregate into low receptor (lasR) expressers that fully commit to QS, and high receptor expressers that delay QS commitment. Our mathematical model shows that such gene expression segregation could mechanistically be spurred by transcription factor limitation. In evolutionary terms, temporal segregation could serve as a QS-brake to allow for a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments.","Jayakumar, P.; Thomas, S. A.; Brown, S.

To facilitate its adaptation to a large variety of niches, this bacterium exploits population density-dependant gene regulation systems called quorum sensing. In P. aeruginosa, three distinct but interrelated quorum sensing systems (las, rhl and pqs) regulate the production of many survival and virulence functions. In prototypical strains, the las system, through its transcriptional regulator LasR, is important for the full activation of the rhl and pqs systems. Still, LasR-deficient isolates have been reported, mostly sampled from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, where they are considered selected by the chronic infection environment. In this study, we show that a defect in LasR activity appears to be an actually widespread mechanism of adaptation in this bacterium. Indeed, we found abundant LasR-defective isolates sampled from hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, hospital sink drains, and meat/fish market environments, using an approach based on phenotypic profiling, supported by gene sequencing. Interestingly, several LasR-defective isolates maintain an active rhl system or are deficient in pqs system signaling. The high prevalence of a LasR-defective phenotype among environmental P. aeruginosa isolates questions the role of quorum sensing in niche adaptation.","Groleau, M.-C.; Taillefer, H.; Vincent, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,166877,A covariation analysis reveals elements of selectivity in quorum sensing systems,"Many bacteria communicate with kin and coordinate group behaviors through a form of cell-cell signaling called acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS). In these systems, a signal synthase produces an AHL to which its paired receptor selectively responds. Selectivity is fundamental to cell signaling. Despite its importance, it has been challenging to determine how this selectivity is achieved and how AHL QS systems evolve and diversify. We hypothesized that we could use covariation within the protein sequences of AHL synthases and receptors to identify selectivity residues. We began by identifying about 6,000 unique synthase-receptor pairs. We then used the protein sequences of these pairs to identify covariation patterns and mapped the patterns onto the LasI/R system from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. The covarying residues in both proteins cluster around the ligand binding sites. We demonstrate that these residues are involved in system selectivity toward the cognate signal and go on to engineer the Las system to both produce and respond to an alternate AHL signal. We have thus demonstrated a new application for covariation methods and have deepened our understanding of how communication systems evolve and diversify.","Miranda, S. W.; Cong, Q.; Schaefer, A.

The slow pace of antibacterial discovery necessitates strategies for optimal use of existing agents, including effective diagnostics able to drive informed prescribing; and development of alternative therapeutic strategies that go beyond traditional small-molecule approaches. Thus, the development of novel probes able to target bacteria for detection and killing, and that can pave the way to effective theranostic strategies, is of great importance. Here we demonstrate that metal-free green-emitting fluorescent carbon dots (FCDs) synthesized from glucosamine HCl and m-phenylenediamine, and featuring 2,5-deoxyfructosazine on a robust amorphous core, can label both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacterial pathogens within 10 minutes of exposure. Moreover, effective killing of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria can be induced by combining FCD treatment with irradiation by LED light in the visible range. Cell-based, electron microscopy and Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomic experiments indicate that FCD administration in combination with LED exposure gives rise to local heating, ROS production, and membrane- and DNA-damage, suggesting multiple routes to FCD-mediated bacterial killing. Our data identify FCDs as materials that combine facile synthesis from low-cost precursors with labelling and light-dependent killing of clinically important bacterial species, and that thus warrant further exploration as the potential bases for novel theranostics.","Takebayashi, Y.; Samphire, J.; Hill, S.

Antitoxin proteins are widely reported as labile, including upon purification and in vitro storage. During the course of studies on a ParDE TA system we noted a prevalent in vitro degradation of the ParD antitoxin. In efforts to combat this for practical use in assays, we characterized parameters impacting the degradation as well as the resulting products. These revealed a mechanism likely mediated by a serine or metal-dependent protease. Using Direct Infusion Mass Spectrometry, the cleavage products were identified as an essentially intact DNA binding region of the antitoxin and with the toxin binding domain completely removed. No other species were identified in the solution, such as a contaminant that may mediate such cleavage. Therefore, while our studies revealed viable strategies to mitigate the in vitro degradation they did not identify any protease, leaving open the possibility of a potential auto-catalytic proteolytic activity of the antitoxin proteins.","Snead, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,167663,Building reusable phage and antibiotic treatments via exploitation of bacteria-phage coevolutionary dynamics.,"People with chronic (long-lasting) infections face the problem that treatment options diminish in time as the pathogen evolves increasing resistance. To address this challenge, we exploit phage and bacterial co-evolution, producing dynamic selection pressures that can return the pathogen to a state of susceptibility to the initial (regulator-approved) therapy. We show that phage OMKO1 alone triggers Arms Race Dynamic (ARD) co-evolution with the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to generalized phage resistance and crucially - failure at reuse. In contrast, co-administration of the phage with antibiotics triggers Fluctuating Selection Dynamics (FSD) co-evolution, allowing for effective reuse after 20 days of treatment. We pursue medical relevance in our experiments with the use of clinically important pathogens, antibiotics, phage, and a benchmarked synthetic sputum medium. Phenotypic and genomic characterization of evolved isolates demonstrates that efflux-targeting phage OMKO1 exerts continued selection for antibiotic susceptibility regardless of co-evolutionary dynamic or antibiotic co-treatment, opening the door for evolutionary robust phage therapy.","Gurney, J.; Brown, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,167921,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa phosphodiesterase gene nbdA is transcriptionally regulated by RpoS and AmrZ,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing serious infections in immune compromised persons. These infections are difficult to erase with antibiotics, due to the formation of biofilms. The biofilm lifecycle is regulated by the second messenger molecule c-di-GMP (bis-3,5-cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate). P. aeruginosa encodes 40 genes for enzymes presumably involved in the biosynthesis and degradation of c-di-GMP. A tight regulation of expression, subcellular localized function and protein interactions control the activity of these enzymes. In this work we elucidated the transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding the membrane-bound phosphodiesterase NbdA. We previously reported a transcriptional and posttranslational role of nitric oxide (NO) on nbdA and its involvement in biofilm dispersal. NO is released from macrophages during infections but can also be produced by P. aeruginosa itself during anaerobic denitrification. Recently however, contradictory results about the role of NbdA within NO-induced biofilm dispersal were published. Therefore, the transcriptional regulation of nbdA was reevaluated to obtain insights into this discrepancy. Determination of the transcriptional start site of nbdA by 5-RACE and subsequent identification of the promoter region revealed a shortened open reading frame (ORF) in contrast to the annotated one. In addition, putative binding sites for RpoS and AmrZ were discovered in the newly defined promoter region. Employing chromosomally integrated transcriptional lacZ reporter gene fusions demonstrated a RpoS-dependent activation and AmrZ repression of nbdA transcription. In order to investigate the impact of NO on nbdA transcription, conditions mimicking exogenous and endogenous NO were applied. While neither exogenous nor endogenous NO had an influence on nbdA promoter activity, deletion of the nitrite reductase gene nirS strongly increased nbdA transcription independently of its enzymatic activity during denitrification. The latter supports a role of NirS in P. aeruginosa apart from its enzymatic function.

IMPORTANCEThe opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses a network of genes encoding proteins for the turnover of the second messenger c-di-GMP involved in regulating-among others-the lifestyle switch between planktonic, motile cells and sessile biofilms. Insight into the transcriptional regulation of these genes is important for the understanding of the protein function within the cell. Determination of the transcriptional start site of the phosphodiesterase gene nbdA revealed a new promoter region and consequently a shortened open reading frame for the corresponding protein. Binding sites for RpoS and AmrZ were identified in silico and confirmed experimentally. Previously reported regulation by nitric oxide was reevaluated and a strong influence of the moonlighting protein NirS identified.","Gerbracht, K.; Zehner, S.; Frankenberg-Dinkel, N.",2021-04-01,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.03.31.437996,1,Nicole  Frankenberg-Dinkel,TU Kaiserslautern,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437996v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.31.437996v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,168312,Phage infection restores PQS signaling and enhances growth of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasI quorum-sensing mutant,"Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is reemerging as a valuable tool to combat multidrug resistant bacteria. A major hurdle in developing efficacious bacteriophage therapies is that bacteria acquire resistance to phage killing. In this context, it is noteworthy that quorum sensing (QS), the bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanism that promotes collective undertaking of group behaviors including anti-phage defenses, enhances bacterial survival in the face of phage attack. QS relies on the production, release, accumulation, and detection of signal molecules called autoinducers. In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the LasI/R QS system induces the RhlI/R QS system, and these two systems control, in opposing manners, the PQS QS system that relies on the autoinducer called PQS. A {Delta}lasI mutant is impaired in PQS synthesis, leading to accumulation of the precursor molecule HHQ. HHQ suppresses growth of the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI strain. We uncover a phage infection-induced mechanism that restores expression of the pqsH gene in the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI QS mutant. PqsH converts HHQ into PQS, preventing HHQ-mediated growth inhibition. Thus, phage-infected P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI cells exhibit superior growth compared to uninfected cells. Phage infection also restores expression of virulence factors and the CRISPR-cas anti-phage defense system in the P. aeruginosa {Delta}lasI strain. This study highlights a challenge for phage therapy, namely that phage infection may make particular bacterial strains faster growing, more virulent, and resistant to phage killing.

ImportanceThe emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria necessitates development of new antimicrobial therapies. Phage therapy relies on exploiting phages, natural enemies of bacteria, in the fight against pathogenic bacteria. For successful phage therapy development, potent phages that exhibit low propensity for acquisition of bacterial resistance are desired. Here, we show that phage infection restores QS, a cell-to-cell communication mechanism in a P. aeruginosa QS mutant, which increases its virulence and resistance to phage killing. Importantly, clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa frequently harbor mutations in particular QS genes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,168234,Gene expression in Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii identifies shared and microbe-specific induction of immune genes,"Antibiotic resistance is a continuing challenge in medicine. There are various strategies for expanding antibiotic therapeutic repertoires, including the use of blow flies. Their larvae exhibit strong antibiotic and antibiofilm properties that alter microbiome communities. One species, Lucilia sericata, is used to treat problematic wounds due to its debridement capabilities and its excretions and secretions that kill some pathogenic bacteria. There is much to be learned about how L. sericata interacts with microbiomes at the molecular level. To address this deficiency, gene expression was assessed after feeding exposure (1 hour or 4 hours) to two clinically problematic pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. The results identified immunity related genes that were differentially expressed when exposed to these pathogens, as well as non-immune genes possibly involved in gut responses to bacterial infection. There was a greater response to P. aeruginosa that increased over time, while few genes responded to A. baumanii exposure and expression was not time-dependent. The response to feeding on pathogens indicates a few common responses and features distinct to each pathogen, which is useful in improving wound debridement therapy and helps develop biomimetic alternatives.","Mckenna, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,168535,Shared and Unique Evolutionary Trajectories to Ciprofloxacin Resistance in Gram-negative Bacterial Pathogens,"The resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotic ciprofloxacin is detected in high rates for a wide range of bacterial pathogens. To investigate dynamics of ciprofloxacin resistance development we proposed a comparative resistomics workflow for three clinically relevant species of Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We combined experimental evolution in a morbidostat with deep sequencing of evolving bacterial populations in time series that reveals both shared and unique aspects of evolutionary trajectories patterns. Representative clone characterization by sequencing and MIC measurements enabled direct assessment of mutations impact on the extent of acquired drug resistance. In all three species we observed a two-stage evolution: (1) early ciprofloxacin resistance reaching 4-16-fold of wildtype MIC commonly as a result of single mutations in DNA gyrase target genes (gyrA or gyrB) and (2) additional genetic alterations affecting transcriptional control of drug efflux machinery or secondary target genes (DNA topoisomerase parC or parE).

ImportanceThe challenge of spreading antibiotic resistance calls for systematic efforts to develop more ""irresistible"" drugs based on deeper understanding of dynamics and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance acquisition. To address this challenge, we have established a comparative resistomics approach which combines experimental evolution in a continuous culturing device, the morbidostat, with ultradeep sequencing of evolving microbial populations to identify evolutionary trajectories (mutations and genome rearrangements) leading to antibiotic resistance over a range of target pathogens. Here we report the comparative resistomics study of three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), which revealed shared and species-specific aspects of the evolutionary landscape leading to robust resistance against the clinically important antibiotic ciprofloxacin. In addition to specific findings, the impact of this study is in highlighting the anticipated utility of a morbidostat-based comparative genomic approach to guide rational optimization of treatment regimens for current antibiotics and development of novel antibiotics with minimized resistance propensities.","Zlamal, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,168386,Structure of the Bacteriophage PhiKZ non-Virion RNA Polymerase,"Bacteriophage {Phi}KZ is the founding member of a family of massive bacterial viruses. It is considered to have therapeutic potential as its host, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is an opportunistic, intrinsically antibiotic resistant, pathogen that kills tens of thousands worldwide each year. {Phi}KZ is an incredibly interesting virus, expressing many systems the host already possesses. On infection, it forms a ""nucleus"", erecting a barrier around its massive genome to exclude host restriction endonucleases and CRISPR-Cas systems. {Phi}KZ infection is independent of the host transcriptional apparatus. It expresses two different multi-subunit RNA polymerases (RNAPs): the virion RNAP (vRNAP) is injected with the viral DNA during infection to transcribe early genes, including those encoding the non-virion RNAP (nvRNAP), which transcribes all further genes. {Phi}KZ nvRNAP is formed by four polypeptides thought to represent homologues of the eubacterial {beta}/{beta}' subunits, and a fifth with unclear homology, but essential for transcription. We have resolved the structure of {Phi}KZ nvRNAP to 3.3 [A], shedding light on its assembly, homology, and the biological role of the fifth subunit: it is an embedded, integral member of the complex, with structural homology and a biochemical role implying that it has evolved from an ancestral homologue to {sigma}-factor.","De Martin Garrido, N.; Orekhova, M.; Lai Wan Loong, Y.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,169231,Nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosaregulates alginate biosynthesis and Type VI secretion system during adaptive and convergent evolution for coinfection in critically ill COVID-19 patients,"COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of death globally and caused huge impact on the health of infected patients. Shift in the lung microbial ecology upon such viral infection often worsens the disease and increases host susceptibility to secondary infections. Recent studies have indicated that bacterial coinfection is an unignorable factor contributing to the aggravation of COVID-19 and posing great challenge to clinical treatments. However, there is still a lack of in-depth investigation on the coinfecting bacteria in COVID-19 patients for better treatment of bacterial coinfection. With the knowledge that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the top coinfecting pathogens, we analyzed the adaptation and convergent evolution of nosocomial P. aeruginosa isolated from two critical COVID-19 patients in this study. We sequenced and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of P. aeruginosa isolates longitudinally and parallelly for its evolutionary traits. P. aeruginosa overexpressed alginate and attenuated Type VI secretion system (T6SS) during coinfection for excessive biofilm formation and suppressed virulence. Results of bacterial competition assay and macrophage cytotoxicity test indicated that P. aeruginosa reduced its virulence towards both prokaryotic competitors and eukaryotic host through inhibiting its T6SS during evolution. P. aeuginosa T6SS is thus one of the reasons for its advantage to cause coinfection in COVID-19 patients while the attenuation of T6SS could cause a shift in the microecological composition in the lung. Our study will contribute to the development of therapeutic measures and the discovery of novel drug target to eliminate P. aeruginosa coinfection in COVID-19 patient.","Qu, J.-X.; Cai, Z.; Duan, X.; Zhang, H.; Han, S.; Yu, K.; Jiang, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Liu, Y.; Liu, Y.; Liu, L.; Yang, L.",2021-04-11,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.04.09.439260,1,Liang  Yang,"School of Medicine, Southern University of Science and Technology",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439260v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439260v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,169380,Cannabidiol (CBD) repurposing as antibacterial: promising therapy of CBD plus polymyxin B against superbugs,"Abstract

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) bacteria are a major worldwide public health problem. In the last decades, resistance to last-resort antibiotics such as polymyxin B (PB) have been increasingly observed among these superbugs, compromising the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. The present study aimed (i) to assess the ultrapure Cannabidiol (CBD) antibacterial activity against a broad diversity of Gram-negative (GN) and Gram-positive (GP) bacteria (44 different species, 95 strains), comprising standard strains and clinical isolates, and (ii) to investigate the antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB against GN bacteria, including chromosomal- and plasmid-acquired PB-resistant and intrinsically PB-resistant GNB. We evaluated CBD in vitro antibacterial activity using the standard broth microdilution method, and the antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB was screened using the standard broth microdilution and confirmed by checkerboard assay. CBD exhibited antibacterial activity against different GP bacterial species, lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-expressing GN diplococcus (GND) (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Moraxella catarrhalis), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The combination CBD + PB exhibited antibacterial activity against PB-resistant GNB (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae) as well as additive and/or synergistic effect against LOS-expressing GND. The antibacterial activity of the combination CBD + PB against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant (MCR-1) E. coli strains could be only demonstrated in the presence of phenylalanine-arginine-{beta}-naphthylamide (PA{beta}N). In conclusion, our results show promising translational potential of the combination CBD + PB against MDR and XDR GNB, including PB-resistant K. pneumoniae, highlighting its potential as a rescue treatment for life-threatening infections caused by these superbugs.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,169720,Phosphorus stress induces the synthesis of novel glycolipids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that confer protection against a last-resort antibiotic,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nosocomial pathogen with a prevalence in immunocompromised individuals and is particularly abundant in the lung microbiome of cystic fibrosis patients. A clinically important adaptation for bacterial pathogens during infection is their ability to survive and proliferate under phosphorus (P) limited growth conditions. Here, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa adapts to P-limitation by substituting membrane glycerophospholipids with sugar-containing glycolipids through a lipid renovation pathway involving a phospholipase and two glycosyltransferases. Combining bacterial genetics and multi-omics (proteomics, lipidomics and metatranscriptomic analyses), we show that the surrogate glycolipids monoglycosyldiacylglycerol and glucuronic acid-diacylglycerol are synthesised through the action of a new phospholipase (PA3219) and two glycosyltransferases (PA3218 and PA0842). Comparative genomic analyses revealed that this pathway is strictly conserved in all P. aeruginosa strains isolated from a range of clinical and environmental settings and actively expressed in the metatranscriptome of a cystic fibrosis patient. Importantly, this phospholipid-to-glycolipid transition comes with significant ecophysiological consequence in terms of antibiotic sensitivity. Mutants defective in glycolipid synthesis survive poorly when challenged with polymyxin B, a last-resort antibiotic for treating multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa. Thus, we demonstrate an intriguing link between adaptation to environmental stress (nutrient availability) and antibiotic resistance, mediated through membrane lipid renovation that is an important new facet in our understanding of the ecophysiology of this bacterium in the lung microbiome of cystic fibrosis patients.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,169971,Genome-scale modeling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 unveils its broad metabolic capabilities and role of metabolism in drug potentiation,"P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections. We have developed an updated genome-scale model (GEM) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 for systems-study of the pathogen. We used both automated and semi-manual approaches to reconstruct and curate the model. After an extensive literature research, we added organism-specific reactions (e.g., phenazine transport and redox metabolism, cofactor metabolism, carnitine metabolism, oxalate production, etc.) to the model. This effort led to a highly curated, three-compartment, and mass-and-charge balanced BiGG model of PA14 that contains 1509 genes, 1779 metabolic reactions and 1151 unique metabolites. The model (iSD1509) has the largest genome coverage of P. aeruginosa PA14 to date with 424 more genes than the previous model (iPau1129). It is also the most accurate with prediction accuracies as high as 92.4% (for gene essentiality) and 93.5% (for substrate utilization). The model simulates growth in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It predicts the biosynthesis of the virulence factor phenazine as a process for the pathogen to grow in low-oxygen environment. Further, a mechanism for the overproduction of a drug susceptibility biomarker (gluconate) can be elucidated by the principles of optimal growth. Finally, the model also simulates drug activity potentiation and protection by fumarate and glyoxylate, respectively, and provides mechanistic explanations for these processes. Overall, iSD1509 can be utilized to decipher the metabolic mechanisms associated with virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PA14 to aid in the development of effective intervention strategies.","Dahal, S.; Renz, A.; Dräger, A.; Yang, L.",2021-09-22,Systems Biology,10.1101/2021.04.15.439930,3,Laurence  Yang,Queen's University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439930v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439930v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

There has been long term interest in identifying spatial differences during biofilm development including clues that identify chemical heterogeneity. Laser ablation sample transfer (LAST) allows site-specific sampling combined with label free proteomics to distinguish radially and axially resolved proteomes for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Specifically, differential protein abundances on oxic vs. anoxic regions of a biofilm was observed by combining LAST with bottom up proteomics. This study reveals active metabolism in the anoxic region of the biofilm with respect to the oxic region in P. aeruginosa, an aerobe by nature. Protein abundance data related to cellular acclimations to chemical gradients include identification of glucose catabolizing proteins, high abundance of proteins from arginine and polyamine metabolism, and proteins that could also support virulence and environmental stress mediation on the anoxic region. Finally, this methodology requires only a few mm2 of biofilm area to identify hundreds of proteins.","Hanley, L.; Pulukkody, A. C.; Yung, Y. P.; Donnarumma, F.; Murray, K. K.; Carlson, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,170675,Evolution under low antibiotic concentrations: a risk for the selection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug resistant mutants in nature,"BACKGROUNDAntibiotic pollution of non-clinical environments might have a relevant impact on human health if resistant pathogens are selected. However, this potential risk is often overlooked, since drug concentrations in nature are usually below their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Albeit, antibiotic resistant bacteria can be selected even at sub-MIC concentrations, in a range that is dubbed the sub-MIC selective window, which depends on both the antibiotic and the pathogen.

OBJECTIVESDetermine the sub-MIC selective windows of seven antibiotics of clinical relevance in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evaluate the risk for selecting resistant mutants in nature, based on published data about the amount of antimicrobials detected in natural environments.

METHODSWe conducted evolution experiments of P. aeruginosa PA14 in presence of sub-MIC concentrations of ceftazidime, amikacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, polymyxin B or imipenem, and measured drug susceptibility of the evolved populations.

RESULTSSub-MIC selective window of quinolones was the largest, and the ones of polymyxin B and imipenem, the narrowest. Clinically relevant multidrug resistant (MDR) mutants (presenting MICs above EUCAST clinical breakpoints) arose within the sub-MIC selective windows of the majority of antibiotics tested, being these phenotypes probably mediated by efflux pumps' activity.

DISCUSSIONOur data show that the concentration of antibiotics reported in aquatic ecosystems -colonizable by P. aeruginosa- are, in occasions, higher than the ones able to select MDR mutants. This finding has implications for understanding the role of different ecosystems and conditions in the emergence of antibiotic resistance from a One-Health point of view. Further, it highlights the importance of delineating the sub-MIC selective windows for drugs of clinical value in pathogens with environmental niches, in order to evaluate the health risks due to antibiotic pollution of natural ecosystems and ultimately tackle antibiotic resistance.","Sanz-Garcia, F.; Hernando-Amado, S.; Martinez, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,170992,A Two-Component System FleS/FleR Regulates Multiple Virulence-Related Traits in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Microorganisms commonly use two-component systems (TCSs) to detect specific environmental changes and respond accordingly for their own benefit. However, the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of a majority of TCSs are still elusive. In this study, we focused on a previously predicted TCS FleS/FleR in Pseudomonas aeruginosa to systematically investigate its regulation and physiological roles. Loss of fleS or fleR or both genes led to decreased biofilm formation and attenuated motility in PAO1, which could be restored by heterologously complementation of FleR but not FleS, confirming that the sensor kinase FleS and the response regulator FleR constitute a TCS pair. To determine the regulatory spectrum of this TCS, we conducted transcriptome sequencing and comparison between the wild-type strain and the fleR deletion mutant. The result showed that the TCS regulates about 440 genes including most of them are involved in the virulence-related pathways, e.g. siderophore biosynthesis, pyocyanin biosynthesis, type III/VI secretion systems, c-di-GMP metabolism, flagellar assembly etc. In addition to its roles in controlling biofilm formation and motility we have already shown, FleR was demonstrated to regulate the production of virulence factors such as pyocyanin and elastase, mediate stress response to SDS, and autoregulate its own expression. Moreover, EMSA assays revealed that FleR regulates flagellum biosynthesis genes flgBCDE, flgFGHIJKL, filC, which are essential for the bacterial motility, by directly interacting with their promoters. Taken together, these results expanded our understanding on the biological roles of FleS/FleR and provided new insights on its regulatory mechanisms.","Zhou, T.; Huang, J.-H.; Feng, Q.-S.; Liu, Z.-Q.; Lin, Q.-Q.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, L.",2021-04-23,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2021.04.22.441042,1,Lianhui  Zhang,"Integrative Microbiology Research Centre, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's R",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.441042v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.22.441042v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,171133,A Panel of Diverse Pseudomonas aeruginosa Clinical Isolates for Research and Development,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections. Successful treatment is hampered by its remarkable ability to rapidly develop resistance to antimicrobial agents, mostly through mutation. In response, the World Health Organization listed carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa as a Priority 1 (Critical) pathogen for research and development of new treatments. A key resource in developing effective countermeasures is access to diverse and clinically relevant strains for testing. Herein we describe a panel of 100 diverse P. aeruginosa strains to support this endeavor.

Whole genome sequencing was performed on 3,785 P. aeruginosa housed in our repository. Isolates were cultured from clinical samples collected from healthcare facilities around the world between 2003 and 2017. Core-genome multi-locus sequence typing and high-resolution SNP-based phylogenetic analyses were used to select a panel of 100 strains that captured the genetic diversity of this collection. Comprehensive antibiotic susceptibility testing was also performed using 14 clinically relevant antibiotics.

This 100-strain diversity panel contained representative strains from 91 different sequence-types, including genetically distinct isolates from major epidemic clones ST-111, ST-235, ST-244, and ST-253. Seventy-one distinct antibiotic susceptibility profiles were identified ranging from pan-sensitive to pan-resistant. Known resistance alleles as well as the most prevalent mutations underlying the antibiotic susceptibilities were characterized for all isolates.

This panel provides a diverse and comprehensive set of P. aeruginosa strains for use in developing solutions to antibiotic resistance. The isolates, and all available meta-data including genome sequences, are available to industry, academic institutions, federal and other laboratories at no additional cost.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most important human pathogens and a leading target in the development of new drugs and therapeutics. This species displays a remarkable level of diversity and any potential therapeutic must contend with this characteristic to ensure it retains efficacy across different strains. To date, only limited panels of P. aeruginosa are available for testing, and none have been designed to capture the genetic diversity of the species. The panel described herein has been designed to address this shortcoming by providing a set of 100 distinct strains that greatly captures the diversity of the species. This panel will be of significant value to research groups working on this important pathogen, both for research purposes and in the development of new diagnostics and countermeasures.","Lebreton, F.; Snesrud, E.; Hall, L.; Mills, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,171755,Refined quantification of infection bottlenecks and pathogen dissemination with STAMPR,"Pathogen population dynamics during infection are critical determinants of infection susceptibility and define patterns of dissemination. However, deciphering these dynamics, particularly founding population sizes in host organs and patterns of dissemination between organs, is difficult because measuring bacterial burden alone is insufficient to observe these patterns. Introduction of allelic diversity into otherwise identical bacteria using DNA barcodes enables sequencing-based measurements of these parameters, in a method known as STAMP (Sequence Tag-Based Analysis of Microbial Population dynamics). However, bacteria often undergo unequal expansion within host organs, resulting in marked differences in the frequencies of barcodes in input and output libraries. Here, we show that these differences confound STAMP-based analyses of founding population sizes and dissemination patterns. We present STAMPR, a successor to STAMP that accounts for such population expansions. Using data from systemic infection of barcoded Extraintestinal Pathogenic E. coli we show that this new framework along with the metrics it yields enhances the fidelity of measurements of bottlenecks and dissemination patterns. STAMPR was also validated on an independent, barcoded Pseudomonas aeruginosa dataset, uncovering new patterns of dissemination within the data. This framework (available at https://github.com/hullahalli/stampr_rtisan), when coupled with barcoded datasets, enables a more complete assessment of within-host bacterial population dynamics.

ImportanceBarcoded bacteria are often employed to monitor pathogen population dynamics during infection. The accuracy of these measurements is diminished by unequal bacterial expansion rates. Here, we develop computational tools to circumvent this limitation and establish additional metrics that collectively enhance the fidelity of measuring within-host pathogen founding population sizes and dissemination patterns. These new tools will benefit future studies of the dynamics of pathogens and symbionts within their respective hosts and may have additional barcode-based applications beyond host-microbe interactions.","Hullahalli, K.; Pritchard, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,171933,Antimicrobial activity and degradation of superhydrophobic magnesium substrates in bacterial media,"The interest in magnesium-based materials is promoted by their biocompatibility, bioresorbability, and by their recently found antibacterial potential. Until now the widespread use of magnesium alloys in different corrosive environments was inhibited by their weakly controllable degradation rate and poorly understood microbiologically induced corrosion behavior. To better understand the degradation and usability of magnesium-based alloys, in this study we have fabricated the superhydrophobic coatings on top of magnesium-based alloy and analyzed the behavior of this alloy in bacterial dispersions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae cells in phosphate buffered saline. It was shown that immersion of such coatings into bacterial dispersions causes notable changes in the morphology of the samples, dependent on the bacterial dispersion composition and the type of bacterial strain. The interaction of superhydrophobic coatings with the bacterial dispersion caused the formation of biofilms and sodium polyphosphate films, which provided enhanced barrier properties for magnesium dissolution and hence for dispersion medium alkalization, eventually leading to inhibition of magnesium substrate degradation. Electrochemical data obtained for superhydrophobic samples continuously contacted with the corrosive bacterial dispersions during 48 h indicated a high level of anti-corrosion protection.","Emelyanenko, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,172198,Evaluation of Antibiotic Tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for Aminoglycosides and its Predicted Gene Regulations Through In-silico Transcriptomic Analysis,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections like cystic fibrosis, endocarditis, bacteremia and sepsis, which are life-threatening and difficult to treat. The lack of antibiotic response in P. aeruginosa is due to adaptive resistance mechanism, which prevents the entry of antibiotics into cytosol of the cell to achieve tolerance. Among different groups of antibiotics, aminoglycosides are used as a parental antibiotic for treatment of P. aeruginosa. This study aims to determine the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance and gene expression changes in P. aeruginosa exposed to amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. These antibiotics were exposed to P. aeruginosa at their MICs and the experimental setup was monitored till 72 hours, followed by the measurement of optical density in the interval of every 12 hours. The growth of P. aeruginosa in MICs of antibiotics represents the kinetics of antibiotic tolerance in amikacin, gentamicin, and tobramycin. Transcriptomic profile of antibiotic exposed P. aeruginosa PA14 was taken from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), NCBI as microarray datasets. The gene expressions of two datasets were compared by test versus control. Tobramycin exposed P. aeruginosa failed to develop tolerance in MICs 0.5{micro}g/mL, 1{micro}g/mL and 1.5{micro}g/mL. Whereas amikacin and gentamicin treated P. aeruginosa developed tolerance in MICs. This depicts the superior in vitro response of tobramycin over the gentamicin and amikacin. Further, in silico transcriptomic analysis of tobramycin treated P. aeruginosa resulted in low expression of 16s rRNA Methyltransferase E, B & L, alginate biosynthesis genes and several proteins of Type 2 Secretory System (T2SS) and Type 3 Secretory System (T3SS). The Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) of alginate biosynthesis, and RNA Methyltransferases suggests increased antibiotic response and low probability of developing resistance. The use of tobramycin as a parental antibiotic with its synergistic combination might combat P. aeruginosa with increased response.","Kumar B, A.; Thankappan, B.; Jayaraman, A.; Gupta, A.",2021-06-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.05.01.442230,3,Abishek  Kumar B,"Kasturba Medical College, Manipal",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.01.442230v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.01.442230v3.full.pdf,cc_by,10.3390/microbiolres12030045
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,172608,Bacteriostatic antibiotics promote the evolution of CRISPR-Cas immunity,"Phage therapy can be used in combination with antibiotics to combat infections with bacterial pathogens1-3. However, bacteria can rapidly evolve phage resistance via receptor mutation, or using their CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems4, which insert short phage-derived sequences into CRISPR loci in the bacterial genome5 to guide sequence-specific cleavage of cognate sequences6. Unlike CRISPR-Cas immunity, mutation of the phage receptor leads to attenuated virulence when the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is infected with its phage DMS3vir7, which underscores the need to predict how phage resistance evolves under clinically relevant conditions. Here, using eight antibiotics with various modes of action, we show that bacteriostatic antibiotics (which inhibit cell growth without killing) specifically promote evolution of CRISPR-Cas immunity in P. aeruginosa by slowing down phage development and providing more time for cells to acquire phage-derived sequences and mount an immune response. Our data show that some antimicrobial treatments can contribute to the evolution of phage-resistant pathogens with high virulence.","Dimitriu, T.; Kurilovich, E.; Lapinska, U.; Severinov, K.; Pagliara, S.; Szczelkun, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,172682,The human innate immune protein calprotectin elicits a multi-metal starvation response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"To combat infections, the mammalian host limits availability of essential transition metals such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) in a strategy termed ""nutritional immunity"". The innate immune protein calprotectin (CP) contributes to nutritional immunity by sequestering these metals to exert antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microbial pathogens. One such pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes opportunistic infections in vulnerable populations including individuals with cystic fibrosis. CP was previously shown to withhold Fe(II) and Zn(II) from P. aeruginosa and induce Fe- and Zn-starvation responses in this pathogen. In this work, we performed quantitative, label-free proteomics to further elucidate how CP impacts metal homeostasis pathways in P. aeruginosa. We report that CP induces an incomplete Fe-starvation response, as many Fe-containing proteins that are repressed by Fe limitation are not affected by CP treatment. The Zn-starvation response elicited by CP seems to be more complete than the Fe-starvation response and includes increases in Zn transporters and Zn-independent proteins. CP also induces the expression of membrane-modifying proteins, and metal-depletion studies indicate this response results from the sequestration of multiple metals. Moreover, the increased expression of membrane-modifying enzymes upon CP treatment correlates with increased resistance to polymyxin B. Thus, response of P. aeruginosa to CP treatment includes both single and multi-metal starvation responses and includes many factors related to virulence potential, broadening our understanding of this pathogens interaction with the host.

ImportanceTransition metals are critical for growth and infection by all pathogens, and the innate immune system withholds these metals from pathogens to limit their growth in a strategy termed ""nutritional immunity"". While multi-metal depletion by the host is appreciated, the majority of metal depletion studies have focused on individual metald. Here we use the innate immune protein calprotectin (CP), which complexes with several metals including iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn), and the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to investigate multi-metal starvation. Using an unbiased label-free proteomics response, we demonstrate that multi-metal withholding by CP induces a regulatory response that is not merely additive of individual metal starvation responses, including the induction of Lipid A modification enzymes.","Nelson, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,173056,Spatial-temporal targeted and non-targeted surveys to assess microbiological composition of drinking water in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.,"Loss of basic utilities, such as drinking water and electricity distribution, were sustained for months in the aftermath of Hurricane Marias (HM) landfall in Puerto Rico (PR) in September 2017. The goal of this study was to assess if there was deterioration in biological quality of drinking water due to these disruptions. This study characterized the microbial composition of drinking water following HM across nine drinking water systems (DWSs) in PR and utilized an extended temporal sampling campaign to determine if changes in the drinking water microbiome were indicative of HM associated disturbance followed by recovery. In addition to monitoring water chemistry, the samples were subjected to culture independent targeted and non-targeted microbial analysis including quantitative PCR (qPCR) and genome-resolved metagenomics. The qPCR results showed that residual disinfectant was the major driver of bacterial concentrations in tap water with marked decrease in concentrations from early to late sampling timepoints. While Mycobacterium avium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not detected in any sampling locations and timepoints, genetic material from Leptospira and Legionella pneumophila were transiently detected in a few sampling locations. The majority of metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from these samples were not associated with pathogens and were consistent with bacterial community members routinely detected in DWSs. Further, whole metagenome-level comparisons between drinking water samples collected in this study with samples from other full-scale DWS indicated no significant deviation from expected community membership of the drinking water microbiome. Overall, our results suggest that disruptions due to HM did not result in significant and sustained deterioration of biological quality of drinking water at our study sites.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,173171,Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis specialization in microbes is driven by biochemical constraints of flux sensing,"Central carbon metabolism is highly conserved across microbial species, but can catalyze very different pathways depending on the organism and their ecological niche. Here, we study the dynamic re-organization of central metabolism after switches between the two major opposing pathway configurations of central carbon metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. We combined growth dynamics and dynamic changes of intracellular metabolite levels with a coarse-grained model that integrates fluxes, regulation, protein synthesis and growth and uncovered fundamental limitations of the regulatory network: after nutrient shifts, metabolite concentrations collapse to their equilibrium, rendering the cell unable to sense which direction the flux is supposed to flow through the metabolic network. The cell can partially alleviate this by picking a preferred direction of regulation at the expense of increasing lag times in the opposite direction. Moreover, decreasing both lag times simultaneously comes at the cost of reduced growth rate or higher futile cycling between metabolic enzymes. These three trade-offs can explain why microorganisms specialize for either glycolytic or gluconeogenic substrates and can help elucidate the complex growth patterns exhibited by different microbial species.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,173429,Vaccination-induced rapid protection against bacterial pneumonia via training alveolar macrophage in mice,"Vaccination strategies for rapid protection against multidrug-resistant bacterial infection are very important, especially for hospitalized patients who have high risk of exposure to these bacteria. However, few such vaccination strategies exist due to a shortage of knowledge supporting their rapid effect. Here we demonstrated a single intranasal immunization of inactivated whole cell (IWC) of Acinetobacter baumannii elicits rapid protection against A. baumannii-infected pneumonia via training of innate immune response in Rag1-/- mice. Immunization-trained alveolar macrophages (AMs) showed enhanced TNF- production upon restimulation. Adoptive transfer of immunization-trained AMs into naive mice mediated rapid protection against infection. Elevated TLR4 expression on vaccination-trained AMs contributed to rapid protection. Moreover, immunization-induced rapid protection was also seen in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia models, but not in Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae model. Our data reveal that a single intranasal immunization induces rapid and efficient protection against certain Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia via training AMs response, which highlights the importance and the possibility of harnessing trained immunity of AMs to design rapid-effecting vaccine.","Hao, G.; Zeng, X.; Peng, L.; Xiang, C.; Zhou, Y.; Zhang, X.; Zhang, J.; Wang, N.; Guo, G.; Li, Y.; Liu, K.; Gu, J.; Zeng, H.; Zhuang, Y.; Li, H.; Zhang, J.; Zhang, W.; Zou, Q.; Shi, Y.",2021-05-10,Immunology,10.1101/2021.05.10.443370,1,Yun  Shi,"West China Biopharmaceutical Research Institute,West China Hospital, Sichuan University",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.10.443370v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.10.443370v1.full.pdf,,10.7554/eLife.69951
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,173650,Engineered type six secretion systems deliver active exogenous effectors and Cre recombinase,"Genetic editing has revolutionized biotechnology but delivery of endonuclease genes as DNA can lead to aberrant integration or overexpression, leading to off-target effects. Here we develop a mechanism to deliver Cre recombinase as a protein by engineering the bacterial type six secretion system (T6SS). Using multiple T6SS fusion proteins, Aeromonas dhakensis or attenuated Vibrio cholerae donor strains, and a gain-of-function cassette for detecting Cre recombination, we demonstrate successful delivery of active Cre directly into recipient cells. Most efficient transfer was achieved using a truncated version of PAAR2 from V. cholerae, resulting in a relatively small (118 amino acid)  delivery tag. We further demonstrate the versatility of this system by delivering an exogenous effector, TseC, enabling V. cholerae to kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This implicates that P. aeruginosa is naturally resistant to all native effectors of V. cholerae and that the TseC chaperone protein is not required for its activity. Moreover, it demonstrates that the engineered system can improve T6SS efficacy against specific pathogens, proposing future application in microbiome manipulation or as a next-generation antimicrobial. Inexpensive and easy to produce, this protein delivery system has many potential applications ranging from studying T6SS effectors to genetic editing.

ImportanceDelivery of protein-based drugs, antigens, and gene-editing agents has broad applications. The type VI protein secretion system (T6SS) can target both bacteria and eukaryotic cells and deliver proteins of diverse size and function. Here we harness the T6SS to successfully deliver Cre recombinase to genetically edit bacteria without requiring the introduction of exogenous DNA into the recipient cells. This demonstrates a promising advantage over current genetic editing tools that require transformation or conjugation of DNA. The engineered secretion tag can also deliver a heterologous antimicrobial toxin that kills an otherwise unsusceptible pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results demonstrate the potential of T6SS-mediated delivery in areas including genome editing, killing drug-resistant pathogens, and studying toxin functions.","Hersch, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,174096,The cyclic dinucleotide 2'3'-cGAMP induces a broad anti-bacterial and anti-viral response in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis,"In mammals, cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) bind and activate STING to initiate an anti-viral type I interferon response. CDNs and STING originated in bacteria and are present in most animals. By contrast, interferons are believed to have emerged in vertebrates; thus, the function of CDN signaling in invertebrates is unclear. Here, we use a CDN, 23-cGAMP, to activate immune responses in a model cnidarian invertebrate, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using RNA-Seq, we found that 23-cGAMP induces robust transcription of both anti-viral and anti-bacterial genes in N. vectensis. Many of the anti-viral genes induced by 23-cGAMP are homologs of vertebrate interferon stimulated genes, implying that the interferon response predates the evolution of interferons. Knockdown experiments identified a role for NF-{kappa}B in specifically inducing anti-bacterial genes downstream of 23-cGAMP. Some of these putative anti-bacterial genes were also found to be induced during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. We characterized the protein product of one of the putative anti-bacterial genes, the N. vectensis homolog of Dae4, and found that it has conserved anti-bacterial activity. This work suggests that a broad anti-bacterial and anti-viral transcriptional response is an evolutionarily ancestral output of 23-cGAMP signaling in animals.

Significance statementCyclic dinucleotides are signaling molecules that originated in bacteria and were subsequently acquired and co-opted by animals for immune signaling. The major cyclic dinucleotide signaling pathway in mammals results in the production of anti-viral molecules called interferons. Invertebrates such as sea anemones lack interferons, and thus it was unclear whether cyclic dinucleotide signaling would play a role in immunity in these animals. Here we report that in the anemone Nematostella vectensis, cyclic dinucleotides activate both anti-viral and anti-bacterial immune responses, and do so through a conserved pathway. These results provide insights into the evolutionary origins of innate immunity, and suggest a broader ancestral role for cyclic dinucleotide signaling that evolved toward more specialized anti-viral functions in mammals.","Margolis, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,173927,STING mediates immune responses in the closest living relatives of animals,"Animals have evolved unique repertoires of innate immune genes and pathways that provide their first line of defense against pathogens. To reconstruct the ancestry of animal innate immunity, we have developed the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, one of the closest living relatives of animals, as a model for studying mechanisms underlying pathogen recognition and immune response. We found that M. brevicollis is killed by exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Moreover, M. brevicollis expresses STING, which, in animals, activates innate immune pathways in response to cyclic dinucleotides during pathogen sensing. M. brevicollis STING increases the susceptibility of M. brevicollis to P. aeruginosa-induced cell death and is required for responding to the cyclic dinucleotide 23 cGAMP. Furthermore, similar to animals, autophagic signaling in M. brevicollis is induced by 23 cGAMP in a STING-dependent manner. This study provides evidence for a pre-animal role for STING in antibacterial immunity and establishes M. brevicollis as a model system for the study of immune responses.","Woznica, A.; Kumar, A.; Sturge, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,174334,Development of antibiotic resistance reveals diverse evolutionary pathways to face the complex and dynamic environment of a long-term treated patient,"Antibiotic resistance development has been studied using approaches that range from laboratory experimental evolution, surveillance and epidemiology, to clinical isolate sequencing. However, evolutionary trajectories depend on the environment in which selection takes place, compelling to address evolutionary analyses in antibiotic-treated patients, to embrace the whole inherent environmental complexities as well as their dynamics over time. Herein, we address the complexity of the bacterial adaptive response to changing antibiotic selective pressures by studying the long-term in-patient evolution of a broad diversity of {beta}-lactam resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa clones. By using mutational and ultra-deep amplicon sequencing, we analyzed multiple generations of a P. aeruginosa hypermutator strain persisting for more than 26 years of chronic infection in the airways of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient. We identified the accumulation of multiple alterations targeting the chromosomally encoded class C {beta}-lactamase (blaPDC), providing structural and functional protein changes that resulted in a continuous enhancement of its catalytic efficiency and high level of cephalosporin resistance. This evolution was linked to the persistent treatment with ceftazidime, which we demonstrate selected for variants with robust catalytic activity against this expanded-spectrum cephalosporin. Surprisingly, ""a gain of function"" of collateral resistance towards ceftolozane, a more recently introduced cephalosporin that was not prescribed to this patient, was also observed and the biochemical basis of this cross-resistance phenomenon was elucidated. This work unveils the diversity of evolutionary trajectories driven by bacteria in the natural CF environmental setting, towards a multidrug resistant phenotype after years of antibiotic treatment against a formidable pathogen.","Colque, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,174182,Clinical Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa secret LasB protease to induce hemorrhagic diffused alveolar damage and acute lung injury in mice,"BackgroundAcute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome are most often caused by bacterial pneumonia, characterized by severe dyspnea and high mortality. Knowledge about the lung injury effects of current clinical bacteria strains is lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of representative pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients to cause ALI/ARDS in mice and identify the virulent factors.

Method7 major bacteria species were isolated from clinical sputum and instilled in to mice airway unilaterally. Histology study was used to judge the lung injury effect. Virulence genes were examined by PCR. Sequence type of P. aeruginosa strains were identified by MLST. LC-MS/MS was used to identify the suspicious protein bands. LasB was purified through DEAE-cellulose column and its toxicity was tested both in vitro and in vivo.

ResultsStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli were randomly separated and tested 3 times. Among them, gram-negative bacteria are more potential than gram-positive bacteria to cause acute lung injury. However, P. aeruginosa is the only pathogen which induced diffused alveolar damage, hemorrhage and hyaline membrane in the lung of mice. The lung injury effect is associated to the excreted matrix metalloproteinase LasB of P. aeruginosa. Purified LasB recapitulated hemorrhagic acute lung injury identical to P. aeruginosa infection in vivo. We found this was due to the powerful degradation effect of LasB on both lung extracellular matrix and key proteins in coagulation cascade without inducing cellular apoptosis.

ConclusionP. aeruginosa strains are most capable to induce ALI/ARDS among major clinical pathogenic bacteria, this ability is specifically attributed to their LasB production.","Zhu, Y.; Chen, F.; Ge, X.; Di, X.; Wang, S.; Pan, S.",2021-05-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.05.15.444319,1,Shuming  Pan,"Department of Emergency Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.444319v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.15.444319v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.2147/jir.s322960
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,174645,Differential surface competition and biofilm invasion strategies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and PA01,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PA14 and PAO1 are among the two best characterized model organisms used to study the mechanisms of biofilm formation, while also representing two distinct lineages of P. aeruginosa. Our previous work showed that P. aeruginosa PA14 and PAO1 use distinct strategies to initiate biofilm growth. Using differentially-labeled strains and microfluidic devices, we show that PAO1 can outcompete PA14 in a head-to-head competition during early colonization of a surface, can do so in constant and perturbed environments, that this advantage is specific to biofilm growth and requires production of the Psl polysaccharide. In contrast, the P. aeruginosa PA14 exhibits a competitive fitness advantage when invading a pre-formed biofilm and is better able to tolerate starvation than PAO1 in the biofilm context. These data support the model that while P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 are both able to effectively colonize surfaces, these strains use distinct strategies that are advantageous under different environmental settings.

ImportanceRecent studies indicate that P. aeruginosa PAO1 and PA14 use distinct strategies to initiate biofilm formation, with PAO1 committing to the surface through a processive mode of attachment, while PA14 uses a non-processive surface engagement strategy. We investigated whether their respective colonization strategies impact their ability to effectively compete under different biofilm-forming regimes. Our work shows that these different strategies do indeed impact how these strains colonize the surface: PAO1 dominates during colonization of a naive surface, while PA14 is more effective in colonizing a pre-formed biofilm or withstanding starvation conditions. These data suggest that even for very similar microbes there may be distinct strategies to successfully colonize and persist on surfaces during the biofilm life cycle.","Katharios-Lanwermeyer, S.; Kasetty, S.; Nadell, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,174948,Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with an expansion of bacteria pathogens in the nose including Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Much of the research conducted on SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 has focused on the systemic host response, especially that generated by severely ill patients. Very few studies have investigated the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 within the nasopharynx, the site of initial infection and viral replication. In this study we profiled changes in the nasal microbial communities as well as in host transcriptional profile during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using 16S amplicon sequencing and RNA sequencing. These analyses were coupled to viral genome sequencing. Our microbiome analysis revealed that the nasal microbiome of COVID patients was unique and was marked by an expansion of bacterial pathogens. Some of these microbes (i.e. Acinetobacter) were shared with COVID negative health care providers from the same medical center but absent in COVID negative outpatients seeking care at the same institutions suggesting acquisition of nosocomial respiratory pathogens. Specifically, we report a distinct increase in the prevalence and abundance of the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in COVID patients that correlated with viral RNA load. These data suggest that the inflammatory environment caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially exposure to the hospital environment leads to an expansion of bacterial pathogens in the nasal cavity that could contribute to increased incidence of secondary bacterial infections.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,175412,Generative neural networks separate common and specific transcriptional responses,"Genome-wide transcriptome profiling identifies genes that are prone to differential expression across contexts (""common DEGs""), as well as genes with changes specific to the experimental manipulation. Distinguishing common DEGs from those that are specifically changed in a context of interest allows more efficient prediction of which genes are specific to a given biological process under scrutiny. Currently, commonly differentially expressed genes or pathways can only be identified through the laborious manual curation of highly controlled experiments, an inordinately time-consuming and impractical endeavor. Here we pioneer an approach for identifying common patterns using generative neural networks. This approach produces a background set of transcriptomic experiments from which a null distribution of gene and pathway changes can be generated. By comparing the set of differentially expressed genes found in a target experiment against the generated background set, common results can be easily separated from specific ones. This ""Specific cOntext Pattern Highlighting In Expression data"" (SOPHIE) approach is broadly applicable to new platforms or any species with a large collection of gene expression data. We apply SOPHIE to diverse datasets including those from human, human cancer, and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. SOPHIE identifies common DEGs in concordance with previously described, manually and systematically determined common DEGs. Further, molecular validation indicates that SOPHIE detects highly specific, but low magnitude, biologically relevant, transcriptional changes. SOPHIEs measure of specificity can complement log fold change values generated from traditional differential expression analyses. For example, by filtering the set of differentially expressed genes, one can identify those genes that are specifically relevant to the experimental condition of interest. Consequently, these results can inform future research directions.","Lee, A. J.; Mould, D. L.; Crawford, J.; Hu, D.; Powers, R. K.; Doing, G.; Costello, J. C.; Hogan, D. A.; Greene, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,176040,Electrolysis of Bacterial Biofilm,Biofilms are a significant global health problem and are of most important clinical impediments of the century. Biofilms play a crucial role in antimicrobial resistance and chronic infections by acting as reservoir for microorganisms. Therefore greater understanding of biofilm and novel methods to eliminate them are needed.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,176077,Density-based binning of gene clusters to infer function or evolutionary history using GeneGrouper,"MotivationIdentifying gene clusters of interest in phylogenetically proximate and distant taxa can help to infer phenotypes of interest. Conserved gene clusters may differ by only a few genes, which can be biologically meaningful, such as the formation of pseudogenes or insertions interrupting regulation. These qualities may allow for unsupervised clustering of similar gene clusters into bins that provide a population-level understanding of the genetic variation in similar gene clusters.

ResultsWe developed GeneGrouper, a command-line tool that uses a density-based clustering method to group gene clusters into bins. GeneGrouper demonstrated high recall and precision in benchmarks for the detection of the 23-gene Salmonella enterica LT2 Pdu gene cluster and four-gene Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Mex gene cluster in 435 genomes containing mixed taxa. In a subsequent application investigating the diversity and impact of gene complete and incomplete LT2 Pdu gene clusters in 1130 S. enterica genomes, GeneGrouper identified a novel, frequently occurring pduN pseudogene. When replicated in vivo, disruption of pduN with a frameshift mutation negatively impacted microcompartment formation. We next demonstrated the versatility of GeneGrouper by clustering both distant homologous gene clusters and variable gene clusters found in integrative and conjugative elements.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,176235,Global analysis of the zinc homeostasis network in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its gene expression dynamics,"Zinc is one of the most important trace elements for life and its deficiency, like its excess, can be fatal. In the bacterial opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Zn homeostasis is not only required for survival, but also for virulence and antibiotic resistance. Thus, the bacterium possesses multiple Zn import/export/storage systems. In this work, we determine the expression dynamics of the entire P. aeruginosa Zn homeostasis network at both transcript and protein levels. Precisely, we followed the switch from a Zn-deficient environment, mimicking the initial immune strategy to counteract bacterial infections, to a Zn-rich environment, representing the phagocyte metal boost used to eliminate an engulfed pathogen. Thanks to the use of the NanoString technology, we timed the global silencing of Zn import systems and the orchestrated induction of Zn export systems. We show that the induction of Zn export systems is hierarchically organized as a function of their impact on Zn homeostasis. Moreover, we identify PA2807 as a novel Zn resistance component in P. aeruginosa and highlight new regulatory links among Zn-homeostasis systems. Altogether, this work unveils a sophisticated and adaptive homeostasis network, which complexity is key in determining a pathogen spread in the environment and during host-colonization.","Ducret, V.; Abdou, M.; Goncalves Milho, C.; Leoni, S.; Martin--Pelaud, O.; Sandoz, A.; Segovia Campos, I.; Tercier Waeber, M.; Valentini, M.; Perron, K.",2021-05-31,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.05.28.446167,3,Karl  Perron,University of Geneva,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.446167v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.28.446167v3.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3389/fmicb.2021.739988
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,176477,Breaching the cell-envelope barriers of gram-positive and fungal microbes by a type VI secretion system in Acidovorax citrulli,"The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a double-tubular toxin-injection nanomachine widely found in gram-negative human and plant pathogens. The current model depicts that the T6SS spear-like Hcp tube is powered by the contraction of an outer sheath to drill through the envelope of a neighboring cell, achieving cytosol to cytosol delivery. However, gram-positive bacteria seem to be impenetrable to such T6SS action. Here we report that a plant pathogen Acidovorax citrulli (AC) deploys a highly potent T6SS to kill a range of bacteria including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium smegmatis as well as fungal species including Candida albicans and Pichia pastoris. Using bioinformatic and biochemical assays, we identified a group of T6SS effectors and characterized one effector RhsB that is critical for interspecies interaction. We report that RhsB contains a conserved YD-repeat domain and a C-terminal nuclease domain. Toxicity of RhsB was neutralized by its downstream immunity proteins through direct interaction. RhsB was cleaved at the C-terminal end and a catalytic mutation within the internal aspartic protease abolished such cleavage. Collectively, the T6SS of AC displays potent activities to penetrate the cell envelope barriers of gram-positive and fungal species, highlighting the greatly expanded capabilities of T6SS in modulating microbiome compositions in complex environments.","Pei, T.-T.; Kan, Y.; Wang, Z.-H.; Tang, M.-X.; Li, H.; Yan, S.; Cui, Y.; Zheng, H.-Y.; Luo, H.; Dong, T.",2021-05-31,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.05.31.446370,1,Tao  Dong,University of Calgary,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.446370v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.446370v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,176951,Disinfection performance of a drinking water bottle system with a UVC LED cap against waterborne pathogens and heterotrophic contaminants,"BackgroundThe purgaty One systems (cap+bottle) are portable stainless-steel water bottles with ultraviolet subtype C (UVC) disinfection capability. This study examines the bottle design, verifies disinfection performance against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae and heterotrophic contaminants and addresses the public health relevance of heterotrophic bacteria.

MethodsBottles were inoculated with bacterial strains and disinfection efficacy examined using colony forming unit (CFU) assay. The heterotrophic plate count (HPC) method was used to determine the disinfection performance against environmental contaminants at day 0 and after 3 days of water stagnation. All UVC irradiation experiments were performed under stagnant conditions to confirm that the preset application cycle of 55 seconds offers the desired disinfection performance under worst case condition. To determine effectiveness of purgaty One systems (cap+bottle) in disinfection, inactivation efficacy or log reduction value (LRV) was determined using bacteria concentration between UVC ON condition and controls (UVC OFF). The study utilized the 16S rRNA gene for isolate characterization by identifying HPC bacteria to confirm if they belong to groups that are of public health concern.

ResultsPurgaty One systems fitted with Klaran UVC LEDs achieved 99.99% inactivation (LRV4) efficacy against E. coli and 99.9% inactivation (LRV3) against P. aeruginosa, V. cholerae and heterotrophic contaminants. Based on the 16S rRNA gene analyses, the study determined that the identified HPC isolates enriched by UVC irradiation are of rare public health concern.

ConclusionThe bottles satisfactorily inactivated the target pathogenic bacteria and HPC contaminants even after 3 days of water stagnation.","Mariita, R. M.; Blumenstein, S. A.; Beckert, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,177045,Molecular mechanism of quorum sensing inhibition in Streptococcus by the phage protein paratox,"Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A Streptococcus, is a Gram-positive bacterium that can be both a human commensal and pathogen. Central to this dichotomy are temperate bacteriophages that incorporate into the bacterial genome as a prophage. These genetic elements encode both the phage proteins as well as toxins harmful to the human host. One such conserved phage protein paratox (Prx) is always found encoded adjacent to the toxin genes and this linkage is preserved during transduction. Within Streptococcus pyogenes, Prx functions to inhibit the quorum-sensing ComRS receptor-signal pair that is the master regulator of natural competence, or the ability to uptake endogenous DNA. Specifically, Prx directly binds and inhibits the receptor ComR by unknown mechanism. To understand how Prx inhibits ComR at the molecular level we pursued an X-ray crystal structure of Prx bound to ComR. The structural data supported by solution X-ray scattering data demonstrate that Prx induces a conformational change in ComR to directly access the DNA binding domain. Furthermore, electromobility shift assays and competition binding assays reveal that Prx effectively uncouples the inter-domain conformational change that is required for activation of ComR by the signaling molecule XIP. Although to our knowledge the molecular mechanism of quorum-sensing inhibition by Prx is unique, it is analogous to the mechanism employed by the phage protein Aqs1 in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Together, this demonstrates an example of convergent evolution between Gram-positive and Gram-negative phages to inhibit quorum-sensing, and highlights the versatility of small phage proteins.","Rutbeek, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,177148,Differential response to prey quorum signals indicates predatory range of myxobacteria,"A potential keystone taxa, myxobacteria contribute to the microbial food web as generalist predators. However, the extent of myxobacterial impact on microbial community structure remains unknown. The chemical ecology of these predator-prey interactions provides insight into myxobacterial production of biologically active specialized metabolites used to benefit consumption of prey as well as the perception of quorum signals secreted by prey. Using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics, we compared how the predatory myxobacteria Myxococcus xanthus and Cystobacter ferrugineus respond to structurally distinct exogenous quorum signaling molecules. Investigating acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) and quinolone type quorum signals used by the clinical pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we identified a general response to AHL signals from both myxobacteria as well as a unique response from C. ferrugineus when exposed to the quinolone signal 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinolone (HHQ). Oxidative detoxification of HHQ in C. ferrugineus was not observed from M. xanthus. Subsequent predation assays indicated P. aeruginosa to be more susceptible to C. ferrugineus predation. These data indicate that as generalist predators myxobacteria demonstrate a common response to the ubiquitous AHL quorum signal class, and we suggest this response likely involves recognition of the homoserine lactone moiety of AHLs. We also suggest that oxidation of HHQ and superior predation of P. aeruginosa observed from C. ferrugineus provides an example of how prey signaling molecules impact predatory specialization of myxobacteria by influencing prey range.

SummaryMultiomic analysis of transcriptional and metabolic responses from the predatory myxobacteria Myxococcus xanthus and Cystobacter ferrugineus exposed to prey signaling molecules of the acylhomoserine lactone and quinolone quorum signaling classes provided insight into myxobacterial specialization associated with predatory eavesdropping. We suggest that the general response observed from both myxobacteria exposed to acylhomoserine lactone quorum signals is likely due to the generalist predator lifestyles of myxobacteria and ubiquity of acylhomoserine lactone signals. We also provide data that indicates the core homoserine lactone moiety included in all acylhomoserine lactone scaffolds to be sufficient to induce this general response. Comparing both myxobacteria, unique transcriptional and metabolic responses were observed from Cystobacter ferrugineus exposed to the quinolone signal 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) natively produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We suggest that this unique response and ability to metabolize quinolone signals contribute to the superior predation of P. aeruginosa observed from C. ferrugineus. These results further demonstrate myxobacterial eavesdropping on prey signaling molecules and provide insight into how responses to exogenous signals might correlate with prey range of myxobacteria.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,177385,Siderophores drive invasion dynamics in bacterial communities through their dual role as public good versus public bad,"Microbial invasions can compromise ecosystem services and spur dysbiosis and disease in hosts. Nevertheless, the mechanisms determining invasion outcomes often remain unclear. Here, we examine the role of iron-scavenging siderophores in driving invasions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into resident communities of environmental pseudomonads. Siderophores can be ""public goods"" by delivering iron to individuals possessing matching receptors; but they can also be ""public bads"" by withholding iron from competitors lacking these receptors. Accordingly, siderophores should either promote or impede invasion, depending on their dual effects on invader and resident growth. Using supernatant feeding and invasion assays, we show that invasion success indeed decreased when the invader was inhibited (public bad) rather than stimulated (public good) by the residents siderophores. Conversely, invasion success often increased when the invader could use its siderophore to inhibit the residents. Our findings identify siderophores as a major driver of invasion dynamics in bacterial communities.","Figueiredo, A. R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,177625,The LysR-type transcriptional regulator BsrA (PA2121) controls vital metabolic pathways in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a facultative human pathogen causing nosocomial infections, has complex regulatory systems involving many transcriptional regulators. LTTR (LysR-Type Transcriptional Regulator) family proteins are involved in the regulation of various processes including stress responses, motility, virulence and amino acid metabolism. The aim of this study was to characterize the LysR-type protein BsrA (PA2121), previously described as a negative regulator of biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Genome wide identification of BsrA binding sites using ChIP-seq revealed 765 BsrA-bound regions in the P. aeruginosa PAO1161 genome, including 367 sites in intergenic regions. The motif T-N11-A was identified within sequences bound by BsrA. Transcriptomic analysis showed altered expression of 157 genes in response to BsrA excess, of which 35 had a BsrA binding site within their promoter regions, suggesting a direct influence of BsrA on the transcription of these genes. BsrA-repressed loci included genes encoding proteins engaged in key metabolic pathways such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The panel of loci possibly directly activated by BsrA, included genes involved in pili/fimbriae assembly as well as secretion and transport systems. In addition, DNA pull-down and regulatory analyses showed the involvement of PA2551, PA3398 and PA5189 in regulation of bsrA expression, indicating that this gene is part of an intricate regulatory network. Taken together, these findings reveal the existence of a BsrA regulon, which performs important functions in P. aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEThis study shows that BsrA, a LysR-type transcriptional regulator from P. aeruginosa, previously identified as a repressor of biofilm synthesis, is part of an intricate global regulatory network. BsrA acts directly and/or indirectly as the repressor and/or activator of genes from vital metabolic pathways (e.g. pyruvate, acetate, tricarboxylic acid cycle), and is involved in control of transport functions and the formation of surface appendages. Expression of the bsrA gene is increased in the presence of antibiotics, which suggests its induction in response to stress, possibly reflecting the need to redirect metabolism under stressful conditions. This is particularly relevant for the treatment of infections caused by P. aeruginosa. In summary, the findings of this study demonstrate that the BsrA regulator performs important roles in carbon metabolism, biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa.","Modrzejewska, M.; Kawalek, A.; Bartosik, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,178637,Novel intracellular phospholipase B from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with activity towards endogenous phospholipids affects biofilm assembly,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a severe threat to immunocompromised patients due to its numerous virulence factors and multiresistance against antibiotics. This bacterium produces and secretes various toxins with hydrolytic activities including phospholipases A, C and D. However, the function of intracellular phospholipases for bacterial virulence has still not been established. Here we demonstrate that the hypothetical gene pa2927 of P. aeruginosa encodes a novel phospholipase B named PaPlaB. PaPlaB isolated from detergent-solubilized membranes of E. coli rapidly degraded various GPLs including endogenous GPLs isolated from P. aeruginosa cells. Cellular localization studies suggest that PaPlaB is peripherally bound to the inner and outer membrane of E. coli, yet the active form was predominantly associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. In vitro activity of purified and detergent-stabilized PaPlaB increases at lower protein concentrations. The size distribution profile of PaPlaB oligomers revealed that decreasing protein concentration triggers oligomer dissociation. These results indicate that homooligomerisation regulates PaPlaB activity by a yet unknown mechanism, which might be required for preventing bacteria from self-disrupting the membrane. We demonstrated that PaPlaB is an important determinant of the biofilm lifestyle of P. aeruginosa, as shown by biofilm quantification assay and confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis of biofilm architecture. This novel intracellular phospholipase B with a putative virulence role contributes to our understanding of membrane GPL degrading enzymes and may provide a target for new therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilms.","Weiler, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,178598,Predicting drug targets by homology modelling of Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins of unknown function,"Efficacies of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections rapidly decline due to antibiotic resistance. This stimulated the development of novel antibiotics, but most attempts failed. As a response, the idea of mining uncharacterised genes of pathogens to identify potential targets for entirely new classes of antibiotics raised. Without knowing the biochemical function of a protein it is difficult to validate its potential for drug targeting; therefore progress in the functional characterisation of bacterial proteins of an unknown function must be accelerated. Here we present a paradigm for comprehensively predicting biochemical functions of a large set of proteins encoded by hypothetical genes in human pathogens, to identify candidate drug targets. A high-throughput approach based on homology modelling with ten templates per target protein was applied on the set of 2103 P. aeruginosa proteins encoded by hypothetical genes. Obtained >21000 homology modelling results and available biological and biochemical information about several thousand templates was scrutinised to predict the function of reliably modelled proteins of unknown function. This approach resulted in assigning, one or often multiple, putative functions to hundreds of enzymes, ligand-binding proteins and transporters. New biochemical functions were predicted for 41 proteins whose essential or virulence-related roles in P. aeruginosa were already experimentally demonstrated. Eleven of them were shortlisted as promising drug targets which participate in essential pathways (maintaining genome and cell wall integrity), virulence-related processes (adhesion, cell motility, host recognition) or antibiotic resistance, which are general drug targets. These proteins are conserved among other WHO priority pathogens but not in humans, therefore they represent high-potential targets for pre-clinical studies. These and many more biochemical functions assigned to uncharacterised proteins of P. aeruginosa, available as PaPUF database may guide the design of experimental screening of inhibitors which is a crucial step toward validation of the most potential targets for the development of novel drugs against P. aeruginosa and other high-priority pathogens.","Babic, N.; Kovacic, F.",2021-06-15,Bioinformatics,10.1101/2021.06.15.448521,1,Filip  Kovacic,"Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf, Institute of Molecular Enzyme Technology",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.448521v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.15.448521v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pone.0258385
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,179691,Evidence for a bacterial Lands cycle phospholipase A: Structural and mechanistic insights into membrane phospholipid remodeling,"Cells steadily adapt their membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) composition to changing environmental and developmental conditions. While the regulation of membrane homeostasis via GPL synthesis in bacteria has been studied in detail, the mechanisms underlying the controlled degradation of endogenous GPLs remain unknown. Thus far, the function of intracellular phospholipases A (PLAs) in GPL remodeling (Lands cycle) in bacteria is not clearly established. Here, we identified the first cytoplasmic membrane-bound phospholipase A1 (PlaF) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa involved in the Lands cycle. PlaF is an important virulence factor, as the P. aeruginosa {Delta}plaF mutant showed strongly attenuated virulence in Galleria mellonella and macrophages. We present a 2.0-[A]-resolution crystal structure of PlaF, the first structure that reveals homodimerization of a single-pass transmembrane (TM) full-length protein. PlaF dimerization, mediated solely through the intermolecular interactions of TM and juxtamembrane regions, inhibits its activity. A dimerization site and the catalytic sites are linked by an intricate ligand-mediated interaction network which likely explains the product (fatty acid) feedback inhibition observed with the purified PlaF protein. We used molecular dynamics simulations and configurational free energy computations to suggest a model of PlaF activation through a coupled monomerization and tilting of the monomer in the membrane, which constrains the active site cavity into contact with the GPL substrates. Thus, these data show the importance of the GPL remodeling pathway for virulence and pave the way for the development of a novel therapeutic class of antibiotics targeting PlaF-mediated membrane GPL remodeling.

SynopsisMembrane homeostasis can be regulated by phospholipase-controlled deacylation of endogenous glycerophospholipids (GPLs) followed by reacylation of products, known as the Lands cycle in eukaryotes. Here we show that the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses intracellular phospholipase A1 (PlaF) to modulate membrane GPL composition, which is the first example in bacteria. This newly identified PLA1 indirectly regulates the bacterial virulence properties by hydrolyzing a specific set of membrane GPLs. The crystal structure of full-length PlaF dimers bound to natural ligands, MD simulations, and biochemical approaches provide insights into the molecular mechanism of dimerization-mediated inactivation of this single-pass transmembrane PLA1. Our findings shed light on a mechanism by which bacterial intracellular PLAs might regulate membrane homeostasis what showcases these enzymes as a promising target for a new class of antibiotics.","Bleffert, F.; Granzin, J.; Caliskan, M.; Schott-Verdugo, S.; Siebers, M.; Thiele, B.; Rahme, L.; Felgner, S.; Doermann, P.; Gohlke, H.; Batra-Safferling, R.; Jaeger, K.-E.; Kovacic, F.",2021-06-23,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2021.06.22.448587,1,Filip  Kovacic,Heinrich Heine University Duesseldorf,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.22.448587v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.22.448587v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.7554/elife.72824
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,179896,Photoinactivation of Catalase Sensitizes Wide-Ranging Bacteria to ROS-Producing Agents and Immune Cells,"Bacteria have evolved to cope with the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using their essential molecular components. Catalase, a heme-containing tetramer protein expressed universally in most of the aerobic bacteria, plays an indispensable role in scavenging excess hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, through utilization of wild-type and catalase-deficient mutants, we identified catalase as an endogenous therapeutic target of 400-420 nm blue light. Catalase residing in bacteria could be effectively inactivated by blue light, subsequently rendering the pathogens extremely vulnerable to H2O2 and H2O2-producing agents. As a result, photoinactivation of catalase and H2O2 synergistically eliminate a wide range of catalase-positive planktonic bacteria and P. aeruginosa inside biofilms. In addition, photoinactivation of catalase is shown to facilitate macrophages to defend against intracellular pathogens. The antimicrobial efficacy of catalase photoinactivation is further validated using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced mice abrasion model. Taken together, our findings offer a catalase-targeting phototherapy against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.","Dong, P.-T.; Jusuf, S.; Hui, J.; Zhan, Y.; Zhu, Y.; Liu, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180136,Enforced specialization fosters mutual cheating and not division of labour in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"A common way for bacteria to cooperate is via the secretion of beneficial public goods (proteases, siderophores, biosurfactants) that can be shared among individuals in a group. Bacteria often simultaneously deploy multiple public goods with complementary functions. This raises the question whether natural selection could favour division of labour where subpopulations or species specialise in the production of a single public good, whilst sharing the complementary goods at the group level. Here we use an experimental system, where we genetically enforce specialization in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with regard to the production of its two siderophores, pyochelin and pyoverdine, and explore the conditions under which specialization can lead to division of labour. When growing pyochelin and pyoverdine specialists at different mixing ratios in various iron limited environments, we found that specialists could only successfully complement each other in environments with moderate iron limitation and grow as good as the generalist wildtype but not better. Under more stringent iron limitation, the dynamics in specialist communities was characterized by mutual cheating and with higher proportions of pyochelin producers greatly compromising group productivity. Nonetheless, specialist communities remained stable through negative frequency-dependent selection. Our work shows that specialization in a bacterial community can be spurred by mutual cheating and does not necessarily result in beneficial division of labour. We propose that natural selection might favour fine-tuned regulatory mechanisms in generalists over division of labour because the former enables generalists to remain flexible and adequately adjust public good investments in fluctuating environments.","Mridha, S.; Kuemmerli, R.",2021-06-26,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2021.06.26.450018,1,Subham  Mridha,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.26.450018v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.26.450018v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/jeb.14001
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180170,Evaluation of Host Defense Peptide (CaD23)-Antibiotic Interaction and Mechanism of Action: Insights from Experimental and Molecular Dynamics Simulations Studies,"Background/aimHost defense peptides (HDPs) have the potential to provide a novel solution to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in view of their unique and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities. We had recently developed a novel hybrid HDP based on LL-37 and human beta-defensin-2, named CaD23, which was shown to exhibit good in vivo antimicrobial efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus in a bacterial keratitis murine model. This study aimed to examine the potential CaD23-antibiotic synergism and to evaluate the underlying mechanism of action of CaD23.

MethodsAntimicrobial efficacy was determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay with broth microdilution method. Peptide-antibiotic interaction was evaluated against S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using established checkerboard assay and time-kill kinetics assay. Fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated and interpreted as synergistic (FICI<0.5), additive (FICI between 0.5-1.0), indifferent (FICI between >1.0 and [&le;]4), or antagonistic (FICI>4). SYTOX green uptake assay was performed to determine the membrane-permeabilising action of CaD23. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the interaction of CaD23 with bacterial and mammalian mimetic membranes.

ResultsCaD23-amikacin and CaD23-levofloxacin combination treatment exhibited a strong additive effect against S. aureus SH1000 (FICI=0.56) and MRSA43300 (FICI=0.56) but a borderline additive-to-indifferent effect against P. aeruginosa (FIC=1.0-2.0). CaD23 (at 25 g/ml; 2x MIC) was able to achieve complete killing of S. aureus within 30 mins. When used at sub-MIC concentration (3.1 g/ml; 0.25x MIC), it was able to expedite the antimicrobial action of amikacin against S. aureus by 50%. The rapid antimicrobial action of CaD23 was attributed to the underlying membrane-permeabilising mechanism of action, evidenced by the SYTOX green uptake assay and MD simulations studies. MD simulations revealed that cationicity, alpha-helicity, amphiphilicity and hydrophobicity (related to the Trp residue at C-terminal) play important roles in the antimicrobial action of CaD23.

ConclusionsCaD23 is a novel membrane-active synthetic HDP that can enhance and expedite the antimicrobial action of antibiotics against Gram-positive bacteria when used in combination. MD simulation serves as a useful tool in dissecting the mechanism of action and guiding the design and optimisation of HDPs.","Ting, D. S. J.; Li, J.; Verma, C. S.; Goh, E. T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180183,Mechanism of actin-dependent activation of nucleotidyl cyclase toxins from bacterial human pathogens,"Several bacterial human pathogens secrete nucleotidyl cyclase toxins, that are activated by interaction with actin of the eukaryotic host cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this process which protects bacteria from self-intoxication is unclear. Here, we report structures of ExoY from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio vulnificus in complex with their corresponding activators F-actin and profilin-G-actin. The structures reveal that in contrast to the apo state, two flexible regions become ordered and interact strongly with actin. The specific stabilization of these regions results in an allosteric stabilization of the distant nucleotide binding pocket and thereby to an activation of the enzyme. Differences in the sequence and conformation of the actin-binding regions are responsible for the selective binding to either F- or G-actin. This specificity can be biotechnologically modulated by exchanging these regions from one toxin to the other.

Other bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases, such as the anthrax edema factor and CyaA from Bortedella pertussis, that bind to calmodulin undergo a similar disordered-to-ordered transition during activation, suggesting that the allosteric activation-by-stabilization mechanism of ExoY is paradigmatic for all bacterial nucleotidyl cyclase toxins.","Belyy, A.; Merino, F.; Mechold, U.; Raunser, S.",2021-06-27,Biochemistry,10.1101/2021.06.27.450065,1,Stefan  Raunser,Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.27.450065v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.27.450065v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41467-021-26889-2
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180165,Distribution and molecular evolution of the anti-CRISPR family AcrIF7,"Anti-CRISPRs are proteins capable of blocking CRISPR-Cas systems and typically encoded in mobile genetic elements. Since their discovery, numerous anti-CRISPR families have been identified. However, little is known about the distribution and sequence diversity of members within a family, nor how these traits influence the anti-CRISPRs function and evolution. Here we use AcrIF7 to explore the dissemination and molecular evolution of an anti-CRISPR family. We uncovered five sub-clusters and prevalent anti-CRISPR variants within the group. Remarkably, AcrIF7 homologs display high similarity despite their broad geographical, ecological and temporal distribution. Although mainly associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, AcrIF7 was identified in distinct genetic backgrounds indicating horizontal dissemination, primarily by phages. Using mutagenesis, we recreated variation observed in databases but also extended the sequence diversity of the group. Characterisation of the variants identified residues key for the anti-CRISPR function and other contributing to its mutational tolerance. Moreover, molecular docking revealed that variants with affected function lose key interactions with its CRISPR-Cas target. Analysis of publicly available data and the generated variants suggests that the dominant AcrIF7 variant corresponds to the minimal and optimal anti-CRISPR selected in the family. Our study provides a blueprint to investigate the molecular evolution of anti-CRISPR families.","Figueroa, W.; Cazares, A.; Cazares, D.; Wu, Y.; De La Cruz, A.; Welch, M.; Kameyama, L.; Nobrega, F.; Guarneros, G.",2022-03-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.06.27.450086,3,Wendy  Figueroa,University of Cambridge,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.27.450086v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.27.450086v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180262,Caspase-1-driven neutrophil pyroptosis promotes an incomplete NETosis upon Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"Multiple neutrophil death programs contribute to host defense against infections. Although expressing all necessary components, neutrophils specifically fail to undergo pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death triggered by the activation of the pro-inflammatory complex inflammasome. In the light of the arm race, we hypothesized that intrinsic neutrophil pyroptosis resistance might be bypassed in response to specific microbial species. We show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) stimulates Caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis in human and murine neutrophils. Mechanistically, activated NLRC4 inflammasome supports Caspase-1-driven Gasdermin-D (GSDMD) activation, IL-1{beta} cytokine release and neutrophil pyroptosis. Furthermore, GSDMD activates Peptidyl Arginine Deaminase-4 which drives an ""incomplete NETosis"" where neutrophil DNA fills the cell cytosol but fails crossing plasma membrane. Finally, we show that neutrophil Caspase-1 account for IL-1{beta} production and contributes to various P. aeruginosa strains spread in mice. Overall, we demonstrate that neutrophils are fully competent for Caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, which drives an unsuspected ""incomplete NETosis"".

SummaryNeutrophils play an essential roles against infections. Although multiple neutrophil death programs contribute to host defense against infections, they fail to undergo pyroptosis, a pro-inflammatory form of cell death. Upon Infections, pyroptosis can be induced in macrophages or epithelial cells upon activation of pro-inflammatory complexes, inflammasomes that trigger Caspase-1-driven Gasdermin dependent plasma membrane lysis. In the light of host-microbe interactions, we hypothesized that yet to find microbial species might hold the capacity to overcome neutrophil resistance to inflammasome-driven pyroptosis. Among several bacterial species, we describe that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa specifically engages the NLRC4 inflammasome, which promotes Caspase-1-dependent Gasdermin-D activation and subsequent neutrophil pyroptosis. Furthermore, inflammasome-driven pyroptosis leads to DNA decondensation and expansion into the host cell cytosol but not to the so called Neutrophil Extracellular Trap (NET) release as DNA fails breaching the plasma membrane. Finally, in vivo P. aeruginosa infections highlight that Caspase-1-driven neutrophil pyroptosis is functional and is detrimental upon P. aeruginosa infection. Altogether, our results unexpectedly underline neutrophil competence for Caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis, a process that contributes to host susceptibility to P. aeruginosa infection.","Santoni, K.; Pericat, D.; Pinilla, M.; Bagayoko, S.; Hessel, A.; Leon-Ycaza, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180324,Single-cell imaging reveals that Staphylococcus aureus is highly competitive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa on surfaces,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus frequently occur together in polymicrobial infections, and their interactions can complicate disease progression as well as treatment options. While interactions between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus have been extensively described using planktonic batch cultures, little is known about whether and how individual cells interact with each other on solid substrates. This is important, because in infections, both species frequently colonize surfaces to form microcolony aggregates and biofilms. Here, we performed single-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy combined with automated image analysis to describe interactions between P. aeruginosa PAO1 with three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, JE2) during microcolony growth on agarose surfaces. While P. aeruginosa is usually considered the dominant species, we found that the competitive balance tips in favor of S. aureus on surfaces. We observed that all S. aureus strains accelerated the onset of microcolony growth in competition with P. aeruginosa and significantly compromised P. aeruginosa growth prior to physical contact. These results suggest that S. aureus deploys mechanisms of both resource competition and interference competition via diffusible compounds. JE2 was the most competitive S. aureus strain, simply usurping P. aeruginosa microcolonies when coming into direct contact, while 6850 was the weakest competitor itself suppressed by P. aeruginosa. Moreover, P. aeruginosa reacted to the assault of S. aureus by showing increased directional growth and expedited expression of quorum sensing regulators controlling the synthesis of competitive traits. Altogether, our results reveal that quantitative single-cell live imaging has the potential to uncover microbial behaviors that cannot be predicted from batch culture studies, and thereby contribute to our understanding of interactions between pathogens that co-colonize host-associated surfaces during polymicrobial infections.","Niggli, S.; Wechsler, T.; Kümmerli, R.",2021-06-28,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.06.28.450150,1,Rolf  Kümmerli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.450150v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.28.450150v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3389/fcimb.2021.733991
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,180428,Substrate access mechanism in a novel membrane-bound phospholipase A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa concordant with specificity and regioselectivity,"PlaF is a cytoplasmic membrane-bound phospholipase A1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that alters the membrane glycerophospholipid (GPL) composition and fosters the virulence of this human pathogen. PlaF activity is regulated by a dimer-to-monomer transition followed by tilting of the monomer in the membrane. However, how substrates reach the active site and how the characteristics of the active site tunnels determine the activity, specificity, and regioselectivity of PlaF for natural GPL substrates has remained elusive. Here, we combined unbiased and biased all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and configurational free energy computations to identify access pathways of GPL substrates to the catalytic center of PlaF. Our results map out a distinct tunnel through which substrates access the catalytic center. PlaF variants with bulky tryptophan residues in this tunnel revealed decreased catalysis rates due to tunnel blockage. The MD simulations suggest that GPLs preferably enter the active site with the sn-1 acyl chain first, which agrees with the experimentally demonstrated PLA1 activity of PlaF. We propose that the acyl chain-length specificity of PlaF is determined by the structural features of the access tunnel, which results in favorable free energy of binding of medium-chain GPLs. The suggested egress route conveys fatty acid products to the dimerization interface and, thus, contributes to understanding the product feedback regulation of PlaF by fatty acid-triggered dimerization. These findings open up opportunities for developing potential PlaF inhibitors, which may act as antibiotics against P. aeruginosa.","Ahmad, S.; Strunk, C. H.; Schott, S.

In this bacterium acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing (QS) can activate expression of over 100 genes, many of which code for extracellular products. P. aeruginosa has become a model for studies of cell-cell communication and coordination of cooperative activities. We hypothesized that long-term growth of bacteria under conditions where only limited QS-controlled functions were required would result in a reduction in the size of the QS-controlled regulon. To test this hypothesis, we grew P. aeruginosa for about 1000 generations in a condition in which expression of QS-activated genes is required for growth. We compared the QS regulons of populations after about 35 generations to those after about 1000 generations in two independent lineages by using quorum quenching and RNA-seq technology. In one evolved lineage the number of QS-activated genes identified was reduced by about 70% and in the other by about 45%.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,181095,Comparative Analysis of non-coding small-RNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Keratitis Strains with Different Antibiotic Susceptibility,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is a gram-negative bacterium causes opportunistic or nosocomial infections in immunocompromised individuals. In recent years, a steady increase in human corneal infections of P. aeruginosa has been reported with increased multi-drug resistance (MDR) or extensively drug resistance (XDR). Several non-coding sRNAs, has been identified to regulate various physiological processes in P. aeruginosa, including biofilm formation, quorum sensing. However, the regulatory mechanism of sRNAs in MDR/XDR pathways of P. aeruginosa keratitis strains is not yet studied. In this study, we identified bacterial sRNAs in publicly available P. aeruginosa keratitis genomes and investigated their regulatory role in MDR/XDR pathways using bioinformatic analysis. Totally, 46 P. aeruginosa keratitis strains from different geographical regions were included. Of 46, Eight (30%) out of Twenty-seven and Nine (52) out of Nineteen P. aeruginosa strains from India and Australia were identified as not-MDR. Whereas, 10 (38%) Indian and 9 (47%) Australian strains were identified as MDR. Eight Indian strains were identified as XDR.

Mutation analysis revealed that SPA0023 carrying P. aeruginosa keratitis strains contains a lesser number of amino acid changes in OprD protein than other strains. These findings indicate, imipenem resistance in SPA0023 carried strains might arose from the negative regulation or inhibition of OprD by SPA0023.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,181080,Evolutionary divergence of the Wsp signal transduction system in β- and γ-proteobacteria,"Bacteria rapidly adapt to their environment by integrating external stimuli through diverse signal transduction systems. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, senses surface-contact through the Wsp signal transduction system to trigger the production of cyclic di-GMP. Diverse mutations in wsp genes that manifest enhanced biofilm formation are frequently reported in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, and in biofilm studies of Pseudomonas spp. and Burkholderia cenocepacia. In contrast to the convergent phenotypes associated with comparable wsp mutations, we demonstrate that the Wsp system in B. cenocepacia does not impact intracellular cyclic di-GMP levels unlike that in Pseudomonas spp. Our current mechanistic understanding of the Wsp system is entirely based on the study of four Pseudomonas spp. and its phylogenetic distribution remains unknown. Here, we present the first broad phylogenetic analysis to date to show that the Wsp system originated in the {beta}-proteobacteria then horizontally transferred to Pseudomonas spp., the sole member of the {gamma}-proteobacteria. Alignment of 794 independent Wsp systems with reported mutations from the literature identified key amino acid residues that fall within and outside annotated functional domains. Specific residues that are highly conserved but uniquely modified in B. cenocepacia likely define mechanistic differences among Wsp systems. We also find the greatest sequence variation in the extracellular sensory domain of WspA, indicating potential adaptations to diverse external stimuli beyond surface-contact sensing. This study emphasizes the need to better understand the breadth of functional diversity of the Wsp system as a major regulator of bacterial adaptation beyond B. cenocepacia and select Pseudomonas spp.

ImportanceThe Wsp signal transduction system serves as an important model system for studying how bacteria adapt to living in densely structured communities known as biofilms. Biofilms frequently cause chronic infections and environmental fouling, and they are very difficult to eradicate. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Wsp system senses contact with a surface, which in turn activates specific genes that promote biofilm formation. We demonstrate that the Wsp system in Burkholderia cenocepacia regulates biofilm formation uniquely from that in Pseudomonas species. Furthermore, a broad phylogenetic analysis reveals the presence of the Wsp system in diverse bacterial species, and sequence analyses of 794 independent systems suggest that the core signaling components function similarly but with key differences that may alter what or how they sense. This study shows that Wsp systems are highly conserved and more broadly distributed than previously thought, and their unique differences likely reflect adaptations to distinct environments.","Kessler, C.; Mhatre, E.; Cooper, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,181132,Controlling Staphylococcus aureus by 2-phenol (2-MAMP) in a co-culture moderates the biofilm and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most encountered organisms in a polymicrobial chronic wound infection. Production of multiple virulence factors by this duo delays wound healing process. Notably, P. aeruginosa displays enhanced virulence in the presence of S. aureus by a peptidoglycan sensing mechanism. Thus, novel therapies are imperative to address polymicrobial infections effectively. Previously, it has been suggested that targeting S. aureus might be a possible approach to reduce the severity of P. aeruginosa in a polymicrobial infection. In this aspect, we have used 2-[(Methylamino)methyl]phenol (2-MAMP), our previously reported QS inhibitor to target S. aureus and phenotypically determine the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa under this condition. Analysis of major virulence factors of Pseudomonas viz. biofilm, pyocyanin and pyoveridine showed a significant reduction. The competitive index (CI) and relative increase ratio (RIR) were determined to understand the organisms interaction in co-culture. Results indicated competitiveness among the strains and on increasing ratios of S. aureus cells, co-existence was noticed. Further, as a sensible approach antibiotic - antivirulence drug combinations were tested on co-culture. Significant improvement in the growth inhibition was observed. Our preliminary results presented here would enable further research to address polymicrobial infection in a novel way.","Selvan, G. T.; Thirunavukkarasu, B.; Pravallika, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,181438,Outer membrane vesicles derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae are a driving force for horizontal gene transfer,"Gram-negative bacteria release outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) into the extracellular environment. Recent studies recognized these vesicles as vectors to horizontal gene transfer, however the parameters that mediate OMVs transfer within bacterial communities remain unclear. The present study highlights for the first time the transfer of plasmids containing resistance genes via OMVs derived from Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). This mechanism confers DNA protection and it is plasmid copy number dependent with a ratio of 3.6 time among high copy-number plasmid (pGR) versus low copy number plasmid (PRM) and the transformation efficiency was 3.6 times greater. Therefore, the DNA amount in the vesicular lumen and the efficacy of horizontal gene transfer was strictly dependent on the identity of the plasmid. Moreover, the role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs in interspecies transfer was described. The transfer ability was not related to the phylogenetic characteristics between the donor and the recipient species. K. pneumoniae-OMVs transferred plasmid to Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia. These findings address the pivotal role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs as vectors for antimicrobial resistance genes spread, contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbial communities.

Author summaryK. pneumoniae is an important opportunistic pathogen that affects several host districts, in particular respiratory and urinary tracts. Hospital-acquired K. pneumoniae infections lead to a 50% mortality rate correlated with rapid acquisition of antibiotic resistance. Currently, the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance among K. pneumoniae isolates is a major concern worldwide. The spread of multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains renders current therapeutic options ineffective. Like all Gram-negative bacteria, K. pneumoniae secretes OMVs. OMVs are spherical structures, with a diameter between 50-250 nm, originating from the outer membrane. OMVs biogenesis allows bacteria to interact with the external environment, increasing bacterial survival under stressful conditions and regulating microbial interactions within bacterial communities. Few evidence recognized OMVs as vectors for horizontal gene transfer, contributing to the spread of resistance. In this scenario, the present study examines the potential role of K. pneumoniae-OMVs in inter- and intra-species diffusion of {beta}-lactam resistance.","Dell'annunziata, F.; Dellaversana, C.; Doti, N.; Donadio, G.; Dal Piaz, F.; Izzo, V.; De Filippis, A.; Galdiero, M.; Altucci, L.; Boccia, G.; Galdiero, M.; Folliero, V.; Franci, G.",2021-07-06,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.07.06.451238,1,Gianluigi  Franci,University of Salerno - Baronissi Campus: Universita degli Studi di Salerno - Campus Baronissi,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.06.451238v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.06.451238v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.3390/ijms22168732
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,181745,Genomic and functional characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-targeting bacteriophages isolated from hospital wastewater,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can be difficult to treat and new therapeutic approaches are needed. Bacteriophage therapy is a promising alternative to traditional antibiotics, but large numbers of isolated and characterized phages are lacking. We collected 23 genetically and phenotypically diverse P. aeruginosa isolates from people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and clinical infections, and characterized their genetic, phenotypic, and prophage diversity. We then used these isolates to screen and isolate 14 new P. aeruginosa-targeting phages from hospital wastewater. Phages were characterized with genome sequencing, comparative genomics, and lytic activity screening against all 23 bacterial host isolates. For four different phages, we evolved bacterial mutants that were resistant to phage infection. We then used genome sequencing and functional analysis of the resistant mutants to study their mechanisms of phage resistance as well as changes in virulence factor production and antibiotic resistance, which differed from corresponding parent bacterial isolates. Finally, we tested two phages for their ability to kill P. aeruginosa grown in biofilms in vitro, and observed that both phages reduced viable bacteria in biofilms by least one order of magnitude. One of these phages also showed activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms grown on CF airway epithelial cells. Overall, this study demonstrates how systematic genomic and phenotypic characterization can be deployed to develop bacteriophages as precision antibiotics.","Nordstrom, H. R.; Evans, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,182204,An intestinally secreted host factor promotes microsporidia invasion of C. elegans,"Microsporidia are ubiquitous obligate intracellular pathogens of animals. These parasites often infect hosts through an oral route, but little is known about the function of host intestinal proteins that facilitate microsporidia invasion. To identify such factors necessary for infection by Nematocida parisii, a natural microsporidian pathogen of Caenorhabditis elegans, we performed a forward genetic screen to identify mutant animals that have a Fitness Advantage with Nematocida (Fawn). We isolated four fawn mutants that are resistant to Nematocida infection and contain mutations in T14E8.4, which we renamed aaim-1 (Antibacterial and Aids invasion by Microsporidia). Expression of AAIM-1 in the intestine of aaim-1 animals restores N. parisii infectivity and this rescue of infectivity is dependent upon AAIM-1 secretion. N. parisii spores in aaim-1 animals are improperly oriented in the intestinal lumen, leading to reduced levels of parasite invasion. Conversely, aaim-1 mutants display both increased colonization and susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and overexpression of AAIM-1 reduces P. aeruginosa colonization. Competitive fitness assays show that aaim-1 mutants are favoured in the presence of N. parisii but disadvantaged on P. aeruginosa compared to wild type animals. Together, this work demonstrates how microsporidia exploits a secreted protein to promote host invasion. Our results also suggest evolutionary trade-offs may exist to optimizing host defense against multiple classes of pathogens.","El Jarkass, H. T.; Mok, C.; Schertzberg, M. R.; Fraser, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,182527,Predation Efficiency upon Clinical Isolates: Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is Prey Specific and Origin Dependent,"The use of predatory bacteria as live antibiotics has been proposed for managing bacterial infections, especially for those caused by antibiotic multiresistant isolates for which there are few therapeutic options. However, the current knowledge in this field is scarce, with most of the available data based on environmental isolates, with a significant lack of human clinical samples. In this study, we evaluated the predatory spectrum of the reference strain Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109J on 13 Serratia marcescens (5 of which were carbapenemase producers) and 78 Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates from respiratory (colonizing the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis) or bacteremic infections, differentiated by phenotype (mucoid or not), antibiotic resistance phenotype (including multidrug-resistant isolates), and genetic lineage (frequent and rare sequence types). The source of the isolates was significantly associated with predation efficiency (100% for S. marcescens, 67% for P. aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis, and 25% for P. aeruginosa from bacteremia). In contrast, no correlation with colonial morphotype, genetic background, or antibiotic susceptibility was found. To evaluate the influence of the predator on the predation event, we employed a more aggressive B. bacteriovorus mutant 109J preying upon the same 48 bacteremic P. aeruginosa isolates. The mutants predation efficiency was higher than that of their wild-type counterpart (43% vs. 25%), pointing out that predation is specific to each prey-predator pair of isolates. Our results provide the most extensive study of clinical prey susceptibility published to date and show that the prey-predator interaction is influenced by the origin of the isolates rather than by their genetic background or their antibiotic susceptibility phenotype.

IMPORTANCEThe potential usefulness of predatory bacteria in controlling human pathogens, particularly those that are multiresistant to antibiotics, is enormous. Although this possibility has long been suggested, there are still no data on predation susceptibility in clinical strains, and the possible presence of autochthonous predators of the human microbiota has not been investigated. In this study, we employed a reference predator with an environmental origin to study predation phenomena in 3 well-characterized collections of human clinical isolates. Our results demonstrated that predation is a specific consequence of each prey-predator interaction, with the origin of the strains the most relevant factor. In contrast, the genetic background, morphotype, and antibiotic resistance did not appear to influence the predation phenomenon. We also highlight the involvement of a putative polyhydroxyalkanoate depolymerase protein of B. bacteriovorus in determining prey susceptibility. To our knowledge, this study is the largest performed with strains of clinical origin, discriminating between various genera and including strains with multiresistance to antibiotics.","Herencias, C.; Saralegui, C.; Halperin, A.; Caballero, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183359,High potency of sequential therapy with only beta-lactam antibiotics,"Evolutionary adaptation is a major source of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. Evolution- informed therapy aims to constrain resistance by accounting for bacterial evolvability. Sequential treatments with antibiotics that target different bacterial processes were previously shown to limit adaptation through genetic resistance trade-offs and negative hysteresis. Treatment with homogeneous sets of antibiotics is generally viewed to be disadvantageous, as it should rapidly lead to cross-resistance. We here challenged this assumption by determining the evolutionary response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to experimental sequential treatments involving both heterogenous and homogeneous antibiotic sets. To our surprise, we found that fast switching between only {beta}-lactam antibiotics resulted in increased extinction of bacterial populations. We demonstrate that extinction is favored by low rates of spontaneous resistance emergence and low levels of spontaneous cross- resistance among the antibiotics in sequence. The uncovered principles may help to guide the optimized use of available antibiotics in highly potent, evolution-informed treatment designs.","Batra, A.; Roemhild, R.; Rousseau, E.; Franzenburg, S.; Niemann, S.; Schulenburg, H.",2021-07-22,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2021.07.20.453050,1,Hinrich  Schulenburg,University of Kiel,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453050v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453050v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.7554/elife.68876
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183201,The efficacy of antimicrobial agents is decreased in a polymicrobial environment,"The airways of people with cystic fibrosis (CF) often harbour diverse polymicrobial communities. These airway infections can be impossible to resolve though antibiotic intervention, even though isolates of the individual species present are susceptible to the treatment when tested in vitro. This suggests that susceptibility to antimicrobial agents may be altered in the presence of other microbial species. In this work, we investigate how polymicrobial cultures of key CF-associated species respond to challenge with species-specific antimicrobial agents; colistin (targets Pseudomonas aeruginosa), fusidic acid (targets Staphylococcus aureus) and fluconazole (targets Candida albicans). We found that, compared with growth in axenic cultures, the target organism was protected (sometimes by several orders of magnitude) from the effect(s) of the antimicrobial agent when grown in a polymicrobial culture. This decreased antimicrobial efficacy in polymicrobial cultures was found to have both phenotypic and inherited components. Whole genome sequencing of the colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms and indels in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis or pilus biogenesis. Colistin resistance associated with loss-of-function mutations in the LPS biosynthetic gene, wzy, could be complemented by expression of the wild-type wzy gene in trans. Our findings indicate that the polymicrobial nature of the CF airways is likely to have a significant impact on the clinical response to antimicrobial therapy.","O'brien, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183203,Plant-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa harbor multiple virulence traits essential for mammalian infection,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading opportunistic pathogen capable of causing fatal infections in immunocompromised individuals and patients with degenerative lung diseases. Agricultural soil and plants are the vast reservoirs of this dreaded pathogen. However, there have been limited attempts to analyze the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa strains associated with edible vegetable plants. This study aims to elucidate the virulence attributes of P. aeruginosa strains isolated from the rhizosphere and endophytic niches of cucumber, tomato, eggplant, and chili collected from agricultural fields. Virulence of the agricultural strains was compared to three previously characterized clinical isolates. Our results showed that 50% of the plant-associated strains formed significant levels of biofilm and exhibited swarming motility. Nearly 80% of these strains produced considerable levels of rhamnolipid and exhibited at least one type of lytic activity (hemolysis, proteolysis, and lipolysis). Their virulence was also assessed based on their ability to suppress the growth of plant pathogens (Xanthomonas oryzae, Pythium aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium oxysporum) and kill a select nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans). The plant-associated strains showed significantly higher virulence against the bacterial phytopathogen whereas the clinical strains had significantly higher antagonism against the fungal pathogens. In C. elegans slow-killing assay, the clinical strains caused 50-100% death while a maximum of 40% mortality was induced by the agricultural strains. This study demonstrates that some of the P. aeruginosa strains associated with edible plants harbor multiple virulence traits. Upon infection of humans or animals, these strains may evolve to be more pathogenic and pose a significant health hazard.","Ambreetha, S.; Marimuthu, P.; Mathee, K.; Balachandar, D.",2021-07-20,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.07.20.453120,1,Kalai  Mathee,"Florida International University, Miami, Florida, USA",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453120v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.20.453120v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183669,Determination of the Two-Component Systems regulatory network reveals core and accessory regulations across Pseudomonas aeruginosa lineages,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa possesses one of the most complex bacterial regulatory networks, which largely contributes to its success as a human opportunistic pathogen. However, most of its transcription factors (TFs) are still uncharacterized and the potential intra-species variability in regulatory networks has been mostly ignored so far. Here, to provide a first global view of the two-component systems (TCSs) regulatory network in P. aeruginosa, we produced and purified all DNA-binding TCS response regulators (RRs) and used DAP-seq to map the genome-wide binding sites of these 55 TFs across the three major P. aeruginosa lineages. The resulting networks encompass about 40% of all genes in each strain and contain numerous new important regulatory interactions across most major physiological processes, including virulence and antibiotic resistance. Strikingly, the comparison between the three representative strains shows that about half of the detected targets are specific to only one or two of the tested strains, revealing a previously unknown large functional diversity of TFs within a single species. Three main mechanisms were found to drive this diversity, including differences in accessory genome content, as exemplified by the strain-specific plasmid in the IHMA87 outlier strain which harbors numerous binding sites of chromosomally-encoded RRs. Additionally, most RRs display potential auto-regulation or RR-RR cross-regulation, bringing to light the vast complexity of this network. Overall, we provide the first complete delineation of the TCS regulatory network in P. aeruginosa that will represent an important resource for future studies on this pathogen.","Trouillon, J.; Imbert, L.; Villard, A.-M.; Vernet, T.; Attree, I.; Elsen, S.",2021-07-24,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.07.23.453361,1,Julian  Trouillon,"Université Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, CEA, IBS UMR 5075, Team Bacterial Pathogenesis and Cellular Responses, 38044, Grenoble, France.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453361v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.23.453361v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1093/nar/gkab928
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183609,Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infection in an ex vivo pig model of the cystic fibrosis lung,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the predominant cause of chronic biofilm infections that form in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). These infections are highly resistant to antibiotics and persist for years in the respiratory tract. One of the main research challenges is that current laboratory models do not accurately replicate key aspects of a chronic P. aeruginosa biofilm infection, highlighted by previous RNA-sequencing studies. We compared the P. aeruginosa PA14 transcriptome in an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model of CF and a well-studied synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM). P. aeruginosa was grown in the EVPL model for 1, 2 and 7 days, and in vitro in SCFM for 1 and 2 days. The RNA was extracted and sequenced at each time point. Our findings demonstrate that expression of antimicrobial resistance genes was cued by growth in the EVPL model, highlighting the importance of growth environment in determining accurate resistance profiles. The EVPL model created two distinct growth environments: tissue-associated biofilm and the SCFM surrounding tissue, each of which cued a transcriptome distinct from that seen in SCFM in vitro. The expression of quorum sensing associated genes in the EVPL tissue-associated biofilm at 48 h relative to in vitro SCFM was found to be similar to CF sputum versus in vitro conditions. Hence, the EVPL model can replicate key aspects of in vivo biofilm infection that are missing from other current models and provides a more accurate P. aeruginosa growth environment for determining antimicrobial resistance.

Significance StatementPseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections that affect people with cystic fibrosis are a well-researched area, yet they continue to evade antimicrobial treatments. The lack of a laboratory model that captures all key aspects of these infections hinders not only research progression but also clinical diagnostics. We used transcriptome analysis to demonstrate how a model using pig lungs can more accurately replicate key characteristics of P. aeruginosa lung infection, including mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and infection establishment. Therefore, this model may be used in the future to further understand infection dynamics to develop novel treatments and more accurate treatment plans. This could improve clinical outcomes as well as quality of life for individuals affected by these infections.","Harrington, N. E.; Littler, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183906,The structural role of bacterial eDNA in the formation of biofilm streamers,"Across diverse habitats, bacteria are mainly found as biofilms, surface-attached communities embedded in a self-secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which enhances bacterial resistance to antimicrobial treatment and mechanical stresses. In the presence of flow and geometric constraints such as corners or constrictions, biofilms take the form of long, suspended threads known as streamers, which bear important consequences in industrial and clinical settings by causing clogging and fouling. The formation of streamers is thought to be driven by the viscoelastic nature of the biofilm matrix. Yet, little is known about the structural composition of streamers and how it affects their mechanical properties. Here, using a microfluidic platform that allows growing and precisely examining biofilm streamers, we show that extracellular DNA (eDNA) constitutes the backbone and is essential for the mechanical stability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa s streamers. This finding is supported by the observations that DNA-degrading enzymes prevent the formation of streamers and clear already formed ones, and that the antibiotic ciprofloxacin promotes their formation by increasing the release of eDNA. Furthermore, using mutants for production of the exopolysaccharide Pel, an important component of P. aeruginosa s EPS, we reveal a new, although indirect role of Pel, in tuning the mechanical properties of the streamers. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of eDNA and of its interplay with Pel in determining the mechanical properties of P. aeruginosa streamers, and suggest that targeting the composition of streamers can be an effective approach to control the formation of these biofilm structures.","Secchi, E.; Savorana, G.; Vitale, A.; Eberl, L.; Stocker, R.; Rusconi, R.",2021-07-26,Biophysics,10.1101/2021.07.26.453754,1,Eleonora  Secchi,ETH Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.26.453754v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.26.453754v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1073/pnas.2113723119
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,183991,"Emergence of a novel mobile RND-type efflux pump gene cluster, tmexC3D2-toprJ1b, in Pseudomonas species","Tigecycline exhibits promising activity against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB), whose infections are difficult to treat with antimicrobials. However, mobile tigecycline resistance genes, such as tmexCD-toprJ, have emerged in Enterobacterales isolated in China, Vietnam, and possibly other countries in the world. In this study, we investigated tigecycline-nonsusceptible GNB in Japan. Eight tigecycline- and carbapenem-nonsusceptible isolates of Pseudomonas alcaligenes were obtained from sewage water from a medical institution in Japan in 2020. Whole genome analysis of all P. alcaligenes isolates was performed using short-read sequencing, and the isolate KAM426 was further analyzed using long-read sequencing. For important antimicrobial resistance genes, analysis of surrounding structures and comparison with similar sequences in the public genome database were performed. We identified a novel hybrid type of tmexCD-toprJ gene cluster, tmexC3D2-toprJ1b consisting of tmexC3, tmexC2, and toprJ1b, in phylogenetically clonal isolates of P. alcaligenes. The complete genome sequence of KAM426 revealed that this isolate co-harbors tmexC3D2-toprJ1b and two copies of the carbapenemase gene blaIMP-1 on the chromosome. tmexC3D2-toprJ1b in KAM426 was flanked by the IS5/IS1182 family transposase gene, suggesting that the gene cluster was acquired by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). tmexC3D2-toprJ1b seemed to have spread to other Pseudomonas species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa via HGT mediated by mobile gene elements such as a plasmid. This study identified tmexCD-toprJ-like tigecycline resistance genes in Japan for the first time and suggests that diverse tmexCD-toprJ-like gene clusters, including tmexC3D2-toprJ1b, have spread among MDR-GNB worldwide.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,184229,Machine Learning of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptomes identifies independently modulated sets of genes associated with known transcriptional regulators,"The transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa plays a critical role in coordinating numerous cellular processes. We extracted and quality controlled all publicly available RNA-sequencing datasets for P. aeruginosa to find 281 high-quality transcriptomes. We produced 83 new RNAseq data sets under critical conditions to generate a comprehensive compendium of 364 transcriptomes. We used this compendium to reconstruct the TRN of P. aeruginosa using independent component analysis (ICA). We identified 104 independently modulated sets of genes (called iModulons), among which 81 (78%) reflect the effects of known transcriptional regulators. We show that iModulons: 1) play an important role in defining the genomic boundaries of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs); 2) show increased expression of the BGCs and associated secretion systems in conditions that emulate cystic fibrosis (CF); 3) show the presence of a novel BGC named RiPP (bacteriocin producer) which might have a role in worsening CF outcomes; 4) exhibit the interplay of amino acid metabolism regulation and central metabolism across carbon sources, and 5) clustered according to their activity changes to define iron and sulfur stimulons. Finally, we compare the iModulons of P. aeruginosa with those of E. coli to observe conserved regulons across two gram negative species. This comprehensive TRN framework covers almost every aspect of the transcriptional regulatory machinery in P. aeruginosa, and thus could prove foundational for future research of its physiological functions.","Rajput, A.; Tsunemoto, H.; Sastry, A.

Published work has found extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, regulation of motility and induction of stress response pathways as contributing to biofilm tolerance during such insults. However, little is known regarding the mechanism(s) whereby biofilm maintenance is regulated when exposed to such environmental challenges. Here, we provide evidence that the diguanylate cyclase YfiN is important for the regulation of biofilm maintenance when exposed to peroxide. We find that, compared to the wild type (WT), static biofilms of the {Delta}yfiN mutant exhibit a maintenance defect, which can be further exacerbated by exposure to peroxide (H2O2); this defect can be rescued through genetic complementation. Additionally, we found that the {Delta}yfiN mutant biofilms produce less c-di-GMP than WT, and that H2O2 treatment enhanced motility of surface-associated bacteria and increased cell death for the {Delta}yfiN mutant grown as a biofilm compared to WT biofilms. These data provide evidence that YfiN is required for biofilm maintenance by P. aeruginosa, via c-di-GMP signaling, to limit motility and protect viability in response to peroxide stress. These findings add to the growing recognition that biofilm maintenance by P. aeruginosa is an actively regulated process that is controlled, at least in part, by the wide array of c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes found in this microbe.

ImportanceWe build on previous findings that suggest that P. aeruginosa utilizes c-di-GMP metabolizing enzymes to actively maintain a mature biofilm. Here, we explore how the diguanylate cyclase YfiN contributes to the regulation of biofilm maintenance during peroxide exposure. We find that mature P. aeruginosa biofilms require YfiN to synthesize c-di-GMP, regulate motility and to insure viability during peroxide stress. These findings provide further evidence that the modulation of c-di-GMP in response to environmental signals is an important mechanism by which biofilms are maintained.","Katharios-Lanwermeyer, S.; Koval, S.; Barrack, K.; O'toole, G.",2021-07-30,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.07.29.454409,1,George  O'toole,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.454409v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.29.454409v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1128/JB.00396-21
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,184491,"Direct and indirect interactions promote complexes of the lipoprotein LbcA, the CtpA protease and its substrates, and other cell wall proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","The Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipoprotein LbcA was discovered because it copurified with and promoted the activity of CtpA, a carboxyl-terminal processing protease (CTP) required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. In this study we explored the role of LbcA by determining its effect on the proteome and its participation in protein complexes. lbcA and ctpA null mutations had strikingly similar effects on the proteome, suggesting that facilitating CtpA might be the most impactful role of LbcA in the bacterial cell. Independent complexes containing LbcA and CtpA, or LbcA and substrate, were isolated from P. aeruginosa cells, indicating that LbcA facilitates proteolysis by recruiting the protease and its substrates independently. An unbiased examination of proteins that copurified with LbcA revealed an enrichment for proteins associated with the cell wall. One of these copurification partners was found to be a new CtpA substrate, and the first substrate that is not a peptidoglycan hydrolase. Many of the other LbcA copurification partners are known or predicted peptidoglycan hydrolases. However, some of these LbcA copurification partners were not cleaved by CtpA, and an in vitro assay revealed that while CtpA and all of its substrates bound to LbcA directly, these non-substrates did not. Subsequent experiments suggested that the non substrates might co-purify with LbcA by participating in multi-enzyme complexes containing LbcA-binding CtpA substrates.

IMPORTANCECarboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and associated with the virulence of several bacteria, including CtpA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CtpA copurifies with the uncharacterized lipoprotein, LbcA. This study shows that the most impactful role of LbcA might be to promote CtpA-dependent proteolysis, and that it achieves this as a scaffold for CtpA and its substrates. It also reveals that LbcA copurification partners are enriched for cell wall-associated proteins, one of which is a novel CtpA substrate. Some of the other LbcA copurification partners are not cleaved by CtpA, but might copurify with LbcA because they participate in multi-enzyme complexes containing CtpA substrates. These findings are important, given the links between CTPs, their associated proteins, peptidoglycan remodeling, and virulence.","Chakraborty, D.; Darwin, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,184761,Genome-wide protein-DNA interaction site mapping using a double strand DNA-specific cytosine deaminase,"DNA-protein interactions (DPIs) are central to such fundamental cellular processes as transcription and chromosome maintenance and organization. The spatiotemporal dynamics of these interactions dictate their functional consequences; therefore, there is great interest in facile methods for defining the sites of DPI within cells. Here, we present a general method for mapping DPI sites in vivo using the double stranded DNA-specific cytosine deaminase toxin DddA. Our approach, which we term DddA-sequencing (3D-seq), entails generating a translational fusion of DddA to a DNA binding protein of interest, inactivating uracil DNA glycosylase, modulating DddA activity via its natural inhibitor protein, and DNA sequencing for genome-wide DPI detection. We successfully applied this method to three Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcription factors that represent divergent protein families and bind variable numbers of chromosomal locations. 3D-seq offers several advantages over existing technologies including ease of implementation and the possibility to measure DPIs at single-cell resolution.","Gallagher, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,185450,Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae infection impedes Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization and persistence in mouse respiratory tract,"Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience lifelong respiratory infections which are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. These infections are polymicrobial in nature, and the predominant bacterial species undergo a predictable series of changes as patients age. Young patients have populations dominated by opportunists that are typically found within the microbiome of the human nasopharynx, such as nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi); these are eventually supplanted and the population within the CF lung is later dominated by pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). In this study, we investigated how initial colonization with NTHi impacts colonization and persistence of Pa in the respiratory tract.

Analysis of polymicrobial biofilms in vitro by confocal microscopy revealed that NTHi promoted greater levels of Pa biofilm volume and diffusion. However, sequential respiratory infection of mice with NTHi followed by Pa resulted in significantly lower Pa as compared to infection with Pa alone. Coinfected mice also had reduced airway tissue damage and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines as compared with Pa infected mice. Similar results were observed after instillation of heat-inactivated NTHi bacteria or purified NTHi lipooligosaccharide (LOS) endotoxin prior to Pa introduction. Based on these results, we conclude that NTHi significantly reduces susceptibility to subsequent Pa infection, most likely due to priming of host innate immunity rather than a direct competitive interaction between species. These findings have potential significance with regard to therapeutic management of early life infections in patients with CF.","Lindgren, N.; Novak, L.; Hunt, B. C.; Mcdaniel, M. S.; Swords, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,185475,Multispecies phase diagram of biofilm architectures reveals biophysical principles of biofilm development,"Bacterial biofilms are among the most abundant multicellular structures on Earth and play essential roles in a wide range of ecological, medical, and industrial processes. However, general principles that govern the emergence of biofilm architecture across different species remain unknown. Here, we combine experiments, simulations and statistical analysis to identify shared biophysical mechanisms that determine biofilm architecture development at the single-cell level, for the species Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data-driven analysis reveals that despite the many molecular differences between these species, the biofilm architecture differences can be described by only two control parameters: cellular aspect ratio and cell density. Further experiments using single-species mutants for which the cell aspect ratio and the cell density are systematically varied, and mechanistic simulations, show that tuning these two control parameters reproduces biofilm architectures of different species. Altogether, our results show that early-stage biofilm architecture is determined by mechanical cell-cell interactions which are conserved across different species and, therefore, provide a unifying understanding of biofilm architecture development.","Jeckel, H.; Diaz-Pascual, F.; Skinner, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,185795,Pseudomonas aeruginosa C-terminal processing protease CtpA assembles into a hexameric structure that requires activation by a spiral-shaped lipoprotein binding partner,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa CtpA is a carboxyl terminal-processing protease that partners with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade at least five cell wall-associated proteins, four of which are cell wall hydrolases. This activity plays an important role in supporting P. aeruginosa virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. However, almost nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying CtpA and LbcA function. Here, we used structural analysis to show that CtpA alone assembles into an inactive hexamer comprising a trimer of dimers, which limits its substrate access and prevents nonspecific degradation. The adaptor protein LbcA is a right-handed open spiral with 11 tetratricopeptide repeats, which might wrap around a substrate to deliver it to CtpA for degradation. By structure-guided mutagenesis and functional assays, we also showed that the interfaces of the CtpA trimer-of-dimers, and an N-terminal helix of LbcA, are important for LbcA-mediated substrate degradation by CtpA both in vitro and in vivo. This work improves our understanding of the molecular mechanism of a CTP within the C-terminal processing peptidase-3 group.

IMPORTANCECarboxyl-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are found in all three domains of life. In bacteria, some CTPs have been associated with virulence, raising the possibility that they could be theraputic targets. However, relatively little is known about their molecular mechanisms of action. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, CtpA supports virulence by working in complex with the outer membrane lipoprotein LbcA to degrade cell wall hydrolases. Here, we report structure-function analyses of CtpA and LbcA, which reveals that CtpA assembles into an inactive hexamer comprising a trimer of dimers. LbcA is monomeric, with an N-terminal region important for binding to and activating CtpA, followed by a spiral structure composed of 11 tetratricopetide repeats, which could wrap around a substrate for delivery to CtpA. This work provides the first structure of a CTP-3 group member, revealing a unique mutimeric arrangement and insight into how this important proteolytic system functions.","Hsu, H.-C.; Wang, M.; Kovach, A.; Darwin, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,185841,Rapid and strain-specific resistance evolution of Staphylococcus aureus against inhibitory molecules secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus frequently occur together in polymicrobial infections, and there is evidence that their interactions negatively affect disease outcome in patients. At the molecular level, interactions between the two bacterial taxa are well-described, with P. aeruginosa usually being the dominant species suppressing S. aureus through a variety of inhibitory molecules. However, in polymicrobial infections, the two species interact over prolonged periods of time, and S. aureus might evolve resistance against inhibitory molecules deployed by P. aeruginosa. Here, we used experimental evolution to test this hypothesis by exposing three different S. aureus strains (Cowan I, 6850, JE2) to the growth-inhibitory supernatant of P. aeruginosa PAO1 over 30 days. We found that all three S. aureus strains rapidly evolved resistance against inhibitory molecules and show that (i) adaptations were strain-specific; (ii) resistance evolution affected the expression of virulence traits; and (iii) mutations in membrane transporters were the most frequent evolutionary targets. Our work indicates that adaptations of S. aureus to co-infecting pathogens could increase virulence and decrease antibiotic susceptibility, because both virulence traits and membrane transporters involved in drug resistance were under selection. Thus, pathogen co-evolution could exacerbate infections and compromise treatment options.","Niggli, S.; Poveda, L.; Grossmann, J.; Kuemmerli, R.",2021-08-10,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.08.10.455797,1,Rolf  Kuemmerli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.455797v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.455797v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,185923,Localized hypermutation drives the evolution of unstable colistin resistance in small populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Colistin has emerged as an important last line of defence for the treatment of infections caused by antibiotic resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Here we investigate the responses of {approx}1,000 populations of an MDR strain of P. aeruginosa to a high dose of colistin. Colistin exposure resulted in rapid cell death, but a sub-set of populations eventually recovered due to the outgrowth of heteroresistant cells. Genome sequencing revealed that heteroresistance was primarily driven by mutations in the PmrAB two-component system that occurred at a rate ({approx}2x10-5 per cell division) that was 103-104 fold higher than typical resistance mutation rates. Crucially, this elevated mutation rate was only found in pmrB, demonstrating that hypermutability is localized to this gene. PmrAB provides resistance to antimicrobial peptides that are involved in host immunity, suggesting that this pathogen may have evolved a high mutation rate as an adaption to generate mutants that are resistant to host antimicrobial peptides that are secreted during infection. Interestingly, we found no mutations in 1/3 of populations that recovered from colistin treatment, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity and/or persister cells contribute to the ability of Pseudomonas to adapt to colistin.","Kapel, N.; Diaz Caballero, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,186787,"Intracellular glycosyl hydrolase PslG shapes bacterial cell fate, signaling, and the biofilm development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Biofilm formation is one of most important causes leading to persistent infections. Exopolysaccharides are usually a main component of biofilm matrix. Genes encoding for glycosyl hydrolases are often found in gene clusters that are involved in the exopolysaccharide synthesis. It remains elusive about the functions of intracellular glycosyl hydrolase and why a polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster requires a glycosyl hydrolase. Here we systematically studied the role of intracellular PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase that is co-transcribed with 15 psl genes, which is responsible for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide Psl (ePsl), a key biofilm matrix polysaccharide in opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We showed that lacking of PslG in this opportunistic pathogen alters the signaling function and structure of ePsl, changes the relative level of cyclic-di-GMP within daughter cells during cell division and shapes the localization of ePsl on bacterial periphery, thus results in long chains of bacterial cells, fast-forming and compact biofilm microcolonies. Our results reveal the important roles of intracellular PslG on the cell fate and biofilm development.","Zhang, J.; Wu, H.; Wang, D.; Zhang, C.; Zhao, K.; Ma, L.",2021-08-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.08.17.456744,1,Luyan  Ma,"Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.17.456744v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.17.456744v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.7554/eLife.72778
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,187376,Coordinately regulated interbacterial antagonism defense pathways constitute a bacterial innate immune system,"Bacterial survival is fraught with antagonism, including that deriving from viruses and competing bacterial cells1-3 4. It is now appreciated that bacteria mount complex antiviral responses; however, whether a coordinated defense against bacterial threats is undertaken is not well understood. Previously we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa possess a danger sensing pathway that is a critical fitness determinant during competition against other bacteria5, 6. Here, we conducted genome-wide screens in P. aeruginosa that reveal three conserved and widespread interbacterial antagonism resistance clusters (arc1-3). We find that although arc1-3 are coordinately activated by the Gac/Rsm danger sensing system, they function independently and provide idiosyncratic defense capabilities, distinguishing them from general stress response pathways. Our findings demonstrate that Arc3 family proteins provide specific protection against phospholipase toxins by preventing the accumulation of lysophospholipids in a manner distinct from previously characterized membrane repair systems. These findings liken the response of P. aeruginosa to bacterial threats to that of eukaryotic innate immunity, wherein threat detection leads to the activation of specialized defense systems.","Ting, S.-Y.; Lacourse, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,187537,Force-induced changes of PilY1 drive surface sensing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"During biofilm formation, the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses its type IV pili (TFP) to sense a surface, eliciting increased second messenger production and regulating target pathways required to adapt to a surface lifestyle. The mechanisms whereby TFP detect surface contact is still poorly understood, although mechanosensing is often invoked with little data supporting this claim. Using a combination of molecular genetics and single cell analysis, with biophysical, biochemical and genomics techniques we show that force-induced changes mediated by the von Willebrand A (vWA) domain-containing, TFP tip-associated protein PilY1 are required for surface sensing. Atomic force microscopy shows that PilY1 can undergo force-induced, sustained conformational changes akin to those observed for mechanosensitive proteins like titin. We show that mutation of a single cysteine residue in the vWA domain results in modestly lower surface adhesion forces, increased nanospring-like properties, as well as reduced c-di-GMP signaling and biofilm formation. Mutating this cysteine has allowed us to genetically separate TFP function in twitching from surface sensing signaling. The conservation of this Cys residue in all P. aeruginosa PA14 strains, and its absence in the ~720 sequenced strains of P. aeruginosa PAO1, could contribute to explaining the observed differences in surface colonization strategies observed for PA14 versus PAO1.

ImportanceMost bacteria live on abiotic and biotic surfaces in surface-attached communities known as biofilms. Surface sensing and increased levels of the second messenger molecule c-di-GMP are crucial to the transition from planktonic to biofilm growth. The mechanism(s) underlying TFP-mediated surface detection that triggers this c-di-GMP signaling cascade are unclear. Here, we provide a key insight into this question: we show that the eukaryotic-like, vWA domain of the TFP tip-associated protein PilY1 responds to mechanical force, which in turn drives production of a key second messenger needed to regulate surface behaviors. Our studies highlight a potential mechanism that could account for differing surface colonization strategies.","Webster, S.; Mathelie-Guinlet, M.; Verissimo, A.; Schultz, D.; Viljoen, A.; Lee, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,187660,A universal microfluidic approach for quantitative study of bacterial biofilms,"Bacteria usually live in densely packed communities called biofilms, where interactions between the bacteria give rise to complex properties. Quantitative analysis is indispensable in understanding those properties. However, current biofilm culturing approaches impose various limitations to these types of analysis. Here, we developed a microfluidic approach for quantitative study of biofilms, which is universal and can be used to culture biofilms of various bacterial species. To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we present two examples, both of which revealed new biological insights. In the first example, we explored the response of Escherichia coli biofilms to exogenous hydrogen peroxide; We found the biofilms gained resistance to H2O2, but their growth was slowed down due to the metabolic cost of maintaining the resistance; However, under oxygen limitation, H2O2 can anti-intuitively boost biofilm growth. In the second example, we explored resource retention by Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms; We observed a fluorescent substance within the biofilm and identified it as the siderophore pyoverdine; We further showed that the extracellular matrix component Psl acted as a retention barrier for pyoverdine, minimizing its loss into the environment and therefore potentially promoting sharing of pyoverdine within the biofilm.","Zhang, Y.; Zeng, L.; Cai, Y.; Chen, Z.; Liu, P.; Ma, L.; Liu, J.",2021-08-25,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.08.24.457583,1,Jintao  Liu,"Center for Infectious Disease Research, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.457583v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.457583v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,187659,The Histone H1-like protein AlgP facilitates even spacing of polyphosphate granules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Synthesis of polyphosphate (polyP) is an ancient and universal stress and starvation response in bacteria. In many bacteria, polyP chains come together to form granular superstructures within cells. Some species appear to regulate polyP granule subcellular organization. Despite the critical role of polyP in starvation fitness, the composition of these structures, mechanism(s) underpinning their organization, and functional significance of such organization are poorly understood. We previously determined that granules become transiently evenly spaced on the cells long axis during nitrogen starvation in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we developed a granule-enrichment protocol to screen for polyP granule-localizing proteins. We identified AlgP as a protein that associates with polyP granules. We further discovered that AlgP is required for the even spacing of polyP granules. AlgP is a DNA-binding protein with a 154 amino acid C-terminal domain enriched in  KPAA repeats and variants of this repeat, with an overall sequence composition similar to the C-terminal tail of eukaryotic histone H1. Granule size, number, and spacing are significantly perturbed in the absence of AlgP, or when AlgP is truncated to remove the C-terminus. The {Delta}algP and algP{Delta}CTD mutants having fewer, larger granules. We speculate that AlgP may contribute to spacing by tethering polyP granules to the chromosome, thereby inhibiting fusion with neighboring granules. Our discovery that AlgP facilitates granule spacing allows us for the first time to directly uncouple granule biogenesis from even spacing, and will inform future efforts to explore the functional significance of granule organization on fitness during starvation.

IMPORTANCEThe mechanisms underpinning polyPs pleiotropic effects on bacterial starvation physiology remain elusive. This simple polyanions lack of protein binding specificity has impeded validation of bona fide polyP-binding proteins. However, polyP forms granule superstructures with spatial specificity. Our granule enrichment protocol identified a polyP granule-associated protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, AlgP. AlgP was originally reported as regulator of alginate, an extracellular polysaccharide important in biofilm formation, including in cystic fibrosis (CF) chronic infections. AlgPs putative role in alginate biosynthesis has recently been called into question. We establish a distinct, previously unknown function for AlgP in modulating the subcellular organization of polyP, another polymer important for pathogenesis. In CF clinical isolates, the C-terminal repeat domain of AlgP is a hotspot for genetic rearrangements. Our finding that the C-terminus of AlgP is required for granule organization lays the groundwork for exploring the functional significance of these mutations in the evolutionary trajectory of chronic infections.","Chawla, R.; Klupt, S.; Patsalo, V.; Williamson, J.; Racki, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,187774,Pseudomonas aeruginosa differentiates substrate rigidity using retraction of type IV pili,"The ability of eukaryotic cells to differentiate substrate stiffness is fundamental for many processes such as the development of stem cells into mature tissue. Here, we establish that bacteria feel their microenvironment in a similar manner. We show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa actively probes and measures substrate stiffness using type IV pili (TFP). The activity of the major virulence factor regulator Vfr is peaked with stiffness in a physiologically important range between 0.1 kPa (mucus) and 1000 kPa (cartilage). The local concentration of PilA at the base of dynamic TFP changes during extension and retraction in a surface dependent manner due to slow PilA diffusion in the cell membrane. Traction force measurements reveal that TFP retraction deforms even stiff substrates. Modeling of the measured substrate deformation and optical tweezers experiments suggest that TFP adhere at the tip only. Informed by these experimental results, we developed a model that describes substrate stiffness dependent dynamics of the polar PilA concentration which are quantitatively consistent with the transcriptional response to stiffness. Manipulating the ATPase activity of the TFP motors changes the TFP extension and retraction velocities and consequently the PilA concentration dynamics in a manner that is predictive of the experimental stiffness response. This work points to the use of a competition between PilA diffusion and TFP extension-retraction as a molecular shear rheometer. Our results highlight that stiffness sensing is a conserved property between the kingdoms of life.","Koch, M. D.; Han, E.; Shaevitz, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,188110,Breaking antimicrobial resistance by disrupting extracytoplasmic protein folding,"Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is one of the greatest threats to global health. New antibacterial strategies are urgently needed, and the development of antibiotic adjuvants that either neutralize resistance proteins or compromise the integrity of the cell envelope is of ever-growing interest. Most available adjuvants are only effective against specific resistance proteins. Here we demonstrate that disruption of cell envelope protein homeostasis simultaneously compromises several classes of resistance determinants. In particular, we find that impairing DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation incapacitates diverse {beta}-lactamases and destabilizes mobile colistin resistance enzymes. Furthermore, we show that chemical inhibition of DsbA sensitizes multidrug-resistant clinical isolates to existing antibiotics and that the absence of DsbA, in combination with antibiotic treatment, substantially increases the survival of Galleria mellonella larvae infected with multidrug- resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This work lays the foundation for the development of novel antibiotic adjuvants that function as broad-acting resistance breakers.

IMPACT STATEMENTDisruption of disulfide bond formation sensitizes resistant Gram- negative bacteria expressing {beta}-lactamases and mobile colistin resistance enzymes to currently available antibiotics.","Furniss, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,188134,Direct multiplex recombinase polymerase amplification for rapid detection of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in food,"Foodborne illness undermines human health by causing fever, stomachache and even lethality. Among foodborne bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are of extraordinary significance which drive reasons of food and beverage poisoning in numerous cases. Today, PCR has been widely used to examine the presence of different foodborne pathogens. However, PCR requires specialized equipment and skillful personnel which limit its application in the field. Recently, there is an emerging of isothermal PCR methods in which the reactions occur at low and constant temperature, allowing their application in restricted-resource settings. In this work, multiplex Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) was used to simultaneously detect S. aureus and P. aeruginosa with high sensitivity and specificity. The limit detection of multiplex RPA was 10 and 30 fg/reaction of genomic DNAs of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. Besides, the reaction time was reduced to only 25 minutes with a low incubation temperature of 39 {degrees}C. Markedly, multiplex RPA reactions succeeded to directly detect as low as 1 and 5 CFU/reaction of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa cells, respectively without the requirement of extracting DNA genome. Moreover, the multiplex RPA reliably detected the two foodborne bacteria in milk, fruit juice and bottled water samples. In general, the direct multiplex RPA described in this study is a rapid, simple, sensitive and efficient alternative tool that could be used to detect the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa without the necessity of costly devices and high-trained staff.","Tran, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,188563,Small proline-rich proteins (SPRRs) are epidermally produced antimicrobial proteins that defend the cutaneous barrier by direct bacterial membrane disruption,"Human skin functions as a physical barrier, preventing the entry of foreign pathogens while also accommodating a myriad of commensal microorganisms. A key contributor to the skin landscape is the sebaceous gland. Mice devoid of sebocytes are prone to skin infection, yet our understanding of how sebocytes function in host defense is incomplete. Here we show that the small proline-rich proteins, SPRR1 and SPRR2 are bactericidal in skin. SPRR1B and SPPR2A were induced in human sebocytes by exposure to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Further, LPS injected into mouse skin triggered the expression of the mouse SPRR orthologous genes, Sprr1a and Sprr2a, through stimulation of MYD88. Both mouse and human SPRR proteins displayed potent bactericidal activity against MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and skin commensals. Thus, Sprr1a-/-;Sprr2a-/- mice are more susceptible to MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin infection. Lastly, mechanistic studies demonstrate that SPRR proteins exert their bactericidal activity through binding and disruption of the bacterial membrane. Taken together, these findings provide insight into the regulation and antimicrobial function of SPRR proteins in skin and how the skin defends the host against systemic infection.","Zhang, C.; Hu, Z.; Lone, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,188659,The nutritional environment is sufficient to select coexisting biofilm and quorum-sensing mutants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The evolution of bacterial populations during infections can be influenced by various factors including available nutrients, the immune system, and competing microbes, rendering it difficult to identify the specific forces that select on evolved traits. The genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from the airway of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), for example, have revealed commonly mutated genes, but which phenotypes led to their prevalence is often uncertain. Here, we focus on effects of nutritional components of the CF airway on genetic adaptations by P. aeruginosa grown in either well-mixed (planktonic) or biofilm-associated conditions. After only 80 generations of experimental evolution in a simple medium with glucose, lactate, and amino acids, all planktonic populations diversified into lineages with mutated genes common to CF infections: morA, encoding a regulator of biofilm formation, or lasR, encoding a quorum sensing regulator that modulates the expression of virulence factors. Although mutated quorum sensing is often thought to be selected in vivo due to altered virulence phenotypes or social cheating, isolates with lasR mutations demonstrated increased fitness when grown alone and outcompeted the ancestral PA14 strain. Nonsynonymous SNPs in morA increased fitness in a nutrient concentration-dependent manner during planktonic growth and surprisingly also increased biofilm production. Populations propagated in biofilm conditions also acquired mutations in loci associated with chronic infections, including lasR and cyclic-di-GMP regulators roeA and wspF. These findings demonstrate that nutrient conditions and biofilm selection are alone sufficient to select mutants with problematic clinical phenotypes including increased biofilm and altered quorum sensing.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa produces dangerous chronic infections that are known for their rapid diversification and recalcitrance to treatment. We performed evolution experiments to identify adaptations selected by two specific aspects of the CF respiratory environment: nutrient levels and surface attachment. Propagation of P. aeruginosa in nutrients present within the CF airway was alone sufficient to drive diversification into subpopulations with identical mutations in regulators of biofilm and quorum sensing to those arising during infection. Thus, the adaptation of opportunistic pathogens to nutrients found in the host may select mutants with phenotypes that complicate treatment and clearance of infection.","Scribner, M. R.; Stephens, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,188870,Interrogation of the integrated mobile genetic elements in gut-associated Bacteroidaceae with a consensus prediction approach,"Exploration of mobile genetic element (MGE) diversity and relatedness is vital to understanding microbial communities, especially the gut microbiome, where the mobilization of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity genes has important clinical consequences. Current MGE prediction tools are biased toward elements similar to previously-identified MGEs, especially tailed phages of proteobacterial hosts. Further, there is a need for methods to examine relatedness and gene sharing among MGEs. We present VICSIN, a consensus approach for MGE prediction and clustering of predictions to provide classification. Testing of VICSIN on datasets of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacteroides fragilis genomes suggests VICSIN is the optimal approach to predict integrated MGEs from poorly-explored host taxa, because of its increased sensitivity and accuracy. We applied VICSIN to a dataset of gut-associated Bacteroidaceae genomes, identifying 816 integrated MGEs falling into 95 clusters, most of which are novel. VICSINs fast and simple network-building scheme revealed a high degree of gene sharing within and between related MGE clusters. Shared gene functions across MGEs include core mobilization functions and accessory gene content, such as type VI secretion systems and antibiotic resistance genes. The MGEs identified here encode a large portion of unknown gene content, emphasizing the fact that the full diversity of MGEs and the factors they encode remain very poorly understood. Together, this work motivates more exploration of the gut mobilome, which is likely one of the most potent drivers of microbial evolution in the human microbiome.

IMPORTANCEMobile genetic elements (MGEs), including phages and integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), drive the diversity and function of microbial communities through horizontal gene transfer. Current tools to predict MGEs in genomic sequence data are highly focused on phages, and are biased against the discovery of novel MGEs. We present VICSIN, a consensus approach to MGE prediction that is able to find a diversity of MGEs, particularly in poorly-understood bacterial taxa. By applying VICSIN to a large database of diverse Bacteroidaceae genomes, we have been able to get a distinct view of the gut mobilome, extending beyond the phageome. These novel MGEs belong to related groups, sharing a significant amount of functional gene content within and between groups, supporting a mosaic model of evolution for ICEs. Understanding how phages evolve in Bacteroidaceae hosts, however, remains elusive and highlights the need for more experimental research.","Campbell, D. E.; Leigh, J. R.; Kim, T.; England, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189109,Parallel evolution of phage resistance - virulence trade - offs during in vitro and nasal Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage treatment,"With rising antibiotic resistance, there has been increasing interest in treating pathogenic bacteria with bacteriophages (phage therapy). One limitation of phage therapy is the ease at which bacteria can evolve resistance. Negative effects of resistance may be mitigated when resistance results in reduced bacterial growth and virulence, or when phage coevolve to overcome resistance. Resistance evolution and its consequences are contingent on the bacteria-phage combination and their environmental context, making therapeutic outcomes hard to predict. One solution might be to conduct ""in vitro evolutionary simulations"" using bacteria-phage combinations from the therapeutic context. Overall, our aim was to investigate parallels between in vitro experiments and in vivo dynamics in a human participant. Evolutionary dynamics were similar, with high levels of resistance evolving quickly with limited evidence of phage evolution. Resistant bacteria - evolved in vitro and in vivo - had lower virulence. In vivo, this was linked to lower growth rates of resistant isolates, whereas in vitro phage resistant isolates evolved greater biofilm production. Population sequencing suggests resistance resulted from selection on de novo mutations rather than sorting of existing variants. These results highlight the speed at which phage resistance can evolve in vivo, and in vitro experiments may give useful insights for clinical evolutionary outcomes.","Castledine, M.; Padfield, D.; Sierocinski, P.; Soria Pascual, J.; Hughes, A.; Mäkinen, L.; Friman, V.-P.; Pirnay, J.-P.; Merabishvili, M.; De Vos, D.; Buckling, A.",2021-10-14,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/2021.09.06.459069,2,Meaghan  Castledine,University of Exeter,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.06.459069v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.06.459069v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.7554/elife.73679
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189361,Copper selects for siderophore-mediated virulence in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Iron is essential for almost all bacterial pathogens and consequently it is actively withheld by their hosts. However, the production of extracellular siderophores enables iron sequestration by pathogens, increasing their virulence. Another function of siderophores is extracellular detoxification of non-ferrous metals. Here, we experimentally link the detoxification and virulence roles of siderophores by testing whether the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays greater virulence after exposure to copper. To do this, we incubated P. aeruginosa under different environmentally relevant copper regimes for either two or twelve days. Subsequent growth in a copper-free environment removed phenotypic effects, before we quantified pyoverdine production (the primary siderophore produced by P. aeruginosa), and virulence using the Galleria mellonella infection model. Copper selected for increased pyoverdine production, which was positively correlated with virulence. This effect increased with time, such that populations incubated with high copper for twelve days were the most virulent. Replication of the experiment with a non-pyoverdine producing strain of P. aeruginosa demonstrated that pyoverdine production was largely responsible for the change in virulence. Therefore we here show a direct link between metal stress and bacterial virulence, highlighting another dimension of the detrimental effects of metal pollution on human health.","Lear, L.; Hesse, E.; Buckling, A.; Vos, M.",2022-05-05,Ecology,10.1101/2021.09.08.459405,3,Luke  Lear,University of Exeter,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.08.459405v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.08.459405v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189644,Pseudomonas aeruginosa synthesizes the autoinducers of its oxylipin-dependent quorum sensing system extracellularly,"The oxylipin-dependent quorum sensing system (ODS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa relies on the production and sensing of two oxylipin autoinducers, 10S-hydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid (10-HOME) and 7S,10S dihydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid (7,10-DiHOME). Here, and contrary to the prevailing notion that bacterial autoinducers are synthesized intracellularly, we show that 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME biosynthesis occurs extracellularly, and this requires the secretion of the oxylipin synthases. We implemented a genetic screen of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1, which identified fourteen genes required for the synthesis of oxylipins. Among the identified genes, four encoded components of the ODS system and the other ten were part of the Xcp type II secretion system (T2SS). We created a deletion mutant of xcpQ, which encodes the outer membrane component of Xcp, and found it recapitulated the impaired functionality of the transposon mutants. Upon further examination, the lack of ODS function was demonstrated to be caused by the blocking of the DS enzymes secretion. Notably, the xcpQ mutant activated the ODS system when exposed to 10-HOME and 7,10-DiHOME, indicating that the sensing component of this quorum sensing system remains fully functional. In contrast with the detrimental effect previously described for T2SS in biofilm formation, here we observed that T2SS was required for robust in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation in an ODS dependent manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to find QS autoinducers that are synthetized in the extracellular space and provides new evidence for the role of the T2SS for biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa.

IMPORTANCEWe previously showed that the ODS quorum sensing system of P. aeruginosa produces and responds to oxylipins derived from host oleic acid by enhancing biofilm formation and virulence. Herein, we developed a genetic screen strategy to explore the molecular basis for oxylipins synthesis and detection. Unexpectedly, we found that the ODS autoinducer synthases cross the outer membrane using the Xcp Type 2 secretion system of P. aeruginosa and thus, the biosynthesis of oxylipins occur extracellularly. Biofilm formation, which was thought to be impaired as result of Xcp activity, was found to be enhanced as result of ODS activation. This is a unique QS system strategy and reveals a new way by which P. aeruginosa interacts with the host environment.","Martinez, E.; Orihuela, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189608,A broad-specificity O-glycoprotease that enables improved analysis of glycoproteins and glycopeptides containing intact complex O-glycans,"Analysis of mucin type O-glycans linked to serine/threonine of glycoproteins is technically challenging, in part, due to a lack of effective enzymatic tools that enable their analysis. Recently, several O-glycan-specific endoproteases that can cleave the protein adjacent to the appended glycan have been described. Despite significant progress in understanding the biochemistry of these enzymes, known O-glycoproteases have specificity constrains, such as inefficient cleavage of glycoproteins bearing sialylated O-glycans, high selectivity for certain type of glycoproteins or protein sequence bias, that limit their analytical application. In this study, we examined the capabilities of an immunomodulating metalloprotease (IMPa) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The peptide substrate sequence selectivity and its impact on IMPa activity was interrogated using an array of synthetic peptides and their glycoforms. We show that IMPa has no specific P1 residue preference and can tolerate most amino acids at the P1 position, except aspartic acid. The enzyme does not cleave between two adjacent O-glycosites, indicating that O-glycosylated serine/threonine is not allowed at position P1. Glycopeptides with as few as two amino acids on either side of an O-glycosite were specifically cleaved by IMPa. Finally, IMPa efficiently cleaved peptides and proteins carrying sialylated and asialylated O-glycans of varying complexity. We present the use of IMPa in a one-step O-glycoproteomics workflow for glycoprofiling of individual purified glycoproteins granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C (CD45) without the need for glycopeptide enrichment. In these examples, IMPa enabled identification of O-glycosites and the range of complex O-glycan structures at each site.","Vainauskas, S.; Guntz, H.; Mcleod, E.; Mcclung, C.; Ruse, C.; Shi, X.; Taron, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189720,Advanced understanding of prokaryotic biofilm formation using a cost-effective and versatile multi-panel adhesion (mPAD) mount,"Most microorganisms exist in biofilms, which comprise aggregates of cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix that provides protection from external stresses. Based on the conditions under which they form, biofilm structures vary in significant ways. For instance, biofilms that develop when microbes are incubated under static conditions differ from those formed when microbes encounter the shear forces of a flowing liquid. Moreover, biofilms develop dynamically over time. Here, we describe a cost-effective, 3D-printed coverslip holder that facilitates surface adhesion assays under a broad range of standing and shaking culture conditions. This multi-panel adhesion (mPAD) mount further allows cultures to be sampled at multiple time points, ensuring consistency and comparability between samples and enabling analyses of the dynamics of biofilm formation. As a proof of principle, using the mPAD mount for shaking, oxic cultures, we confirm previous flow chamber experiments showing that Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type and a phenazine deletion mutant ({Delta}phz) form similar biofilms. Extending this analysis to anoxic conditions, we reveal that microcolony and biofilm formation can only be observed under shaking conditions and are decreased in the {Delta}phz mutant compared to wild-type cultures, indicating that phenazines are crucial for the formation of biofilms if oxygen as an electron acceptor is not available. Furthermore, while the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii does not require archaella for attachment to surfaces under static conditions, we demonstrate that H. volcanii mutants that lack archaella are negatively affected in their early stages of biofilm formation under shaking conditions.

ImportanceDue to the versatility of the mPAD mount, we anticipate that it will aid the analysis of biofilm formation in a broad range of bacteria and archaea. Thereby, it contributes to answering critical biological questions about the regulatory and structural components of biofilm formation and understanding this process in a wide array of environmental, biotechnological, and medical contexts.","Schulze, S.; Schiller, H.; Solomonic, J.; Telhan, O.; Costa, K.; Pohlschroder, M.",2021-09-10,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.09.09.459712,1,Mechthild  Pohlschroder,University of Pennsylvania,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.09.459712v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.09.459712v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/aem.02283-21
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,189978,Screening of antimicrobial activity of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of some medicinal plants from Cameroon and assessment of their synergy with common antibiotics against multidrug-resistant uropathogenic bacteria.,"Background and aimThe Cameroonian flora abounds in plants with multidimensional therapeutic virtues which can play an important role in the fight against resistance to antibiotics and the search for new antimicrobials. This study aimed to screen the antimicrobial potential of aqueous and ethanolic extracts of thirteen (13) samples (Bark, leaf, seed) of eight (8) plants from Cameroon against 3 reference pathogens and to evaluate their synergy with conventional antibiotics against eleven (11) multiresistant uropathogenic (MRU) bacteria.

MethodBioactive compounds were extracted from leaves of Leucanthemum vulgare, Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf, Moringa oleifera Lam and Vernonia amygdalina Delile; barks of Cinchona officinalis and Enantia chlorantha Oliv; barks and seeds of Garcinia lucida Vesque and leaves and seeds of Azadirachta indica (Neem) using distilled water and ethanol as solvents. The extracts were tested against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Candida albicans 10231 using the well diffusion method and the microdilution method. The synergistic effect was assessed (using disc diffusion method and the checkerboard method) against MRU bacteria namely Achromobacter xylosoxidans 4892, Citrobacter freundii 426, Enterococcus avium 1669, Escherichia coli 1449, Klebsiella oxytoca 3003, Kocuria rizophilia. 1542, Moraxella catarrhalis 4222, Morganella morganii 1543, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3057, Staphylococcus aureus 1449 and Streptococcus agalactiae 3984.

ResultsWe found that distilled water extracted a more important mass of phytochemical compounds (7.9-21.2%) compared to ethanol (5.8-12.4%). Except C. officinalis and G. lucida leaves, the rest of extracts were active with inhibition diameters (ID) ranging from 5 to 36 mm. Both ethanolic (EE) and aqueous extract (AE) of E. chloranta bark (ECB) were the most active against all pathogens with the mean ID of 17 and 36 mm vs S. aureus ATCC 6538, 23 and 14 mm vs E. coli ATCC 25922 and 36 and 19 mm vs C. albicans ATCC 10231. Only the EE of E. chloranta bark (ECB) had a strong activity against all the microorganisms tested (MIC <2 mg / ml); L. vulgare leaves (LVL) and G. lucida seed (GLS) had moderate (average MIC of 8 mg/ml) while all other extracts showed very weak antimicrobial activity. In addition, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) ranged from 0.125 to 0.750. No antagonism (FIC> 4) or indifference (1[&le;] FIC[&le;]4) was noted between the extracts and the antibiotics, but the best synergies were found with ECB which well-modulated Kanamycin (FIC = 0.125 against S. aureus and 0.250 against E. coli), nitrofurantoin (FIC = 0.250 against S. aureus and 0.188 against E. coli) and ampicillin (FIC = 0.125 against E. coli). Similarly, compared to other extracts, ECB, LVL and GLS also well-modulated ampicillin, ceftazidime, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, and trimethoprim against all the above-mentioned resistant uropathogenic bacteria with important increase in fold area (IFA).

ConclusionThis study show that E. chlorantha bark, L. vulgare leaves G. lucida seed, have good antimicrobial activity against both bacteria (Gram positive and Gram negative) and fungi (C. albicans); and should be more investigated for their possible use to the fight against MDR and MRU microorganisms.","Joseph Arsene, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,190132,Secretin channel-interactors prevent antibiotic influx during type IV pili assembly in P. aeruginosa,"Type IV pili (T4P) are important virulence factors involved in host attachment and other aspects of bacterial pathogenesis. In Gram-negative bacteria, the T4P filament is polymerized from pilin subunits at the platform complex in the inner membrane (IM) and exits the outer membrane (OM) through the OM secretin channel. Although essential for T4P assembly and function, the OM secretin complexes can potentially impair the permeability barrier function of the OM and allow the entry of antibiotics and other toxic molecules. The mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria prevent secretin-mediated OM leakage is currently not well understood. Here, we report a discovery of SlkA and SlkB (PA5122 and PA5123) that prevent permeation of several classes of antibiotics through the secretin channel of Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili. We found these periplasmic proteins interact with the OM secretin complex and prevent toxic molecules from entering through the channel when there is a problem in the assembly of the T4P IM subcomplexes or when docking between the OM and IM complexes is defective. Thus, our results indicate that the secretin channel-interacting proteins play an important role in maintaining the OM permeability barrier, suggesting they may be attractive targets for potentiators that sensitize Gram-negative pathogens to antibiotics that are normally ineffective at penetrating the OM.","Cho, H.; Kwon, O.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,190306,Poly (acetyl arginyl) glucosamine attenuates Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a rat lung infection model,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen that can cause chronic infections in multiple disease states, including respiratory infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis. Like many opportunists, P. aeruginosa forms multicellular biofilm communities that are widely thought to be an important determinant of bacterial persistence and resistance to antimicrobials and host immune effectors during chronic/recurrent infections. Poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG) is a glycopolymer which has antimicrobial activity against a broad range of bacterial species, and also has mucolytic activity which can normalize rheologic properties of cystic fibrosis mucus. In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of PAAG on P. aeruginosa bacteria within biofilms in vitro, and in the context of experimental pulmonary infection in a rodent infection model. PAAG treatment caused significant bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa biofilms, and a reduction in the total biomass of preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms on abiotic surfaces, as well as on the surface of immortalized cystic fibrosis human bronchial epithelial cells. Studies of membrane integrity indicated that PAAG causes changes to P. aeruginosa cell morphology and dysregulates membrane polarity. PAAG treatment reduced infection and consequent tissue inflammation in experimental P. aeruginosa rat infections. Based on these findings we conclude that PAAG represents a novel means to combat P. aeruginosa infection, which may warrant further evaluation as a therapeutic.","Garcia, B.; Mcdaniel, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,191238,"Functional and Structural Characterization of OXA-935, a Novel OXA-10-family β-lactamase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Resistance to antipseudomonal penicillins and cephalosporins is often driven by the overproduction of the intrinsic {beta}-lactamase AmpC. However, OXA-10-family {beta}-lactamases are a rich source of resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. OXA {beta}-lactamases have a propensity for mutation leading to extended spectrum cephalosporinase and carbapenemase activity. In this study, we identified isolates from a subclade of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) high risk clonal complex CC446 with resistance to ceftazidime. Genomic analysis revealed that these isolates harbored a plasmid containing a novel allele of blaOXA-10, named blaOXA-935, which was predicted to produce an OXA-10 variant with two amino acid substitutions: an aspartic acid instead of glycine at position 157 and a serine instead of phenylalanine at position 153. The G157D mutation, present in OXA-14, is associated with resistance to ceftazidime. Deletion of blaOXA-935 restored sensitivity to ceftazidime and susceptibility profiling of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains expressing blaOXA-935 revealed that OXA-935 conferred ceftazidime resistance. To better understand the impact of the variant amino acids, we determined the crystal structures of OXA-14 and OXA-935. In OXA-14, one of two monomers contained the canonical carbamylated lysine-70 (K70). In contrast, both monomers of OXA-935 were decarbamylated at K70, and the F153S mutation conferred increased flexibility to the omega ({Omega}) loop. Compared to OXA-14, the catalytic efficiency of OXA-935 for nitrocefin was significantly reduced. Amino acid changes that confer extended spectrum cephalosporinase activity to OXA-10-family {beta}-lactamases are concerning given rising reliance on novel {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam to treat MDR P. aeruginosa infections.","Pincus, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,191660,Neutron crystallography reveals novel mechanisms used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa for host-cell binding,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major cause of nosocomial infections, uses carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) as part of its binding to host cells. The fucose-binding lectin, LecB, displays a unique carbohydrate-binding site that incorporates two closely located calcium ions bridging between the ligand and protein, providing specificity and unusually high affinity. Here, we investigate the mechanisms involved in binding based on neutron crystallography studies of a fully deuterated LecB/fucose/calcium complex. The neutron structure, which includes the positions of all the hydrogen atoms, reveals that the high affinity of binding may be related to the occurrence of a low barrier hydrogen bond induced by the proximity of the two calcium ions, the presence of coordination rings between the sugar, calcium and LecB, and the dynamic behaviour of bridging water molecules at room temperature. These key structural details may assist in the design of anti-adhesive compounds to combat multi-resistance bacterial infections.","Gajdos, L.; Blakeley, M. P.; Haertlein, M.; Forsyth, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,192050,Defining hierarchical protein interaction networks from spectral analysis of bacterial proteomes,"Cellular phenotypes emerge from a hierarchy of molecular interactions: proteins interact to form complexes, pathways, and phenotypes. We show that hierarchical networks of protein interactions can be extracted from the statistical pattern of proteome variation as measured across thousands of bacteria and that these hierarchies reflect the emergence of complex bacterial phenotypes. We describe the mathematics underlying our statistical approach and validate our results through gene-set enrichment analysis and comparison to existing experimentally-derived hierarchical databases. We demonstrate the biological utility of our unbiased hierarchical models by creating a model of motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and using it to discover a previously unappreciated genetic effector of twitch-based motility. Overall, our approach, SCALES (Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered Evolutionary Signals), predicts hierarchies of protein interaction networks describing emergent biological function using only the statistical pattern of bacterial proteome variation.","Zaydman, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,192077,Exploration of BAY 11-7082 as a novel antibiotic,"Exposure of the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics increases formation of biofilms. We exploited this phenotype to identify molecules with potential antimicrobial activity in a biofilm-based high-throughput screen. The anti-inflammatory compound BAY 11-7082 induced dose-dependent biofilm stimulation, indicative of antibacterial activity. We confirmed that BAY 11-7082 inhibits growth of P. aeruginosa and other priority pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We synthesized 27 structural analogues, including a series based on the related scaffold 3-(phenylsulfonyl)-2-pyrazinecarbonitrile (PSPC), 10 of which displayed increased anti-Staphylococcal activity. Because the parent molecule inhibits the NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, we measured the ability of select analogues to reduce IL-1{beta} production in mammalian macrophages, identifying minor differences in the structure-activity relationship for the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of this scaffold. Although we could evolve stably resistant MRSA mutants with cross resistance to BAY 11-7082 and PSPC, their lack of shared mutations suggested that the two molecules could have multiple targets. Finally, we showed that BAY 11-7082 and its analogues potentiate the activity of penicillin G against MRSA, suggesting that this scaffold may serve as an interesting starting point for the development of antibiotic adjuvants.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,192815,Immunometabolic hijacking of immune cells by a Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum-sensing signal,"Macrophages utilize metabolic pathways to generate energy and metabolites that may be vulnerable to pathogen hijacking to favor pathogen survival and persistence. It is unclear how bacterial pathogens alter metabolic pathways in immune cells for their benefit and persistence in the infected host. We have shown that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) signal molecule 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA) allows pathogen persistence in host tissues by triggering host tolerization via histone deacetylase (HDAC)1-mediated epigenetic reprogramming. Here, we provide strong evidence that 2-AA-meditated persistence is linked to specific metabolic pathway alterations that reduce energy availability and biosynthetic macromolecules involved in host immune responses. 2-AA promotes a Warburg-like metabolic reprogramming effect, thereby increasing levels of lactate, which repressed inflammatory signaling in macrophages. Moreover, it interferes with pyruvate translocation to mitochondria, reducing mitochondrial (mt)-oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) due to down-regulation of estrogen-regulated receptor (ERR) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)-1. This metabolic reprogramming dampened energy production, reduced the acetyl-CoA pool, and generated an anti-inflammatory milieu that favors P. aeruginosa persistence. These findings provide evidence of first-in-class metabolic reprogramming in immune cells mediated by a QS signaling molecule. The specific metabolic programs affected provide insights that may guide the design and development of therapeutics and protective interventions against pathogen-induced immunometabolic alterations and persistence factors.","Bandyopadhaya, A.; Singh, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,193100,Chlorhexidine reduced susceptibility associated to tetracycline resistance in clinical isolates of Escherichia coli,"Chlorhexidine is a widely used antiseptic in hospital and community healthcare. Decreased susceptibility to this compound has been recently described in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, together with cross-resistance to colistin. Surprisingly, few data are available for Escherichia coli, the main species responsible for community and healthcare-associated infections. In order to decipher chlorhexidine resistance mechanisms in E. coli, we studied both in vitro derived and clinical isolates through whole-genome sequence analysis. Comparison of strains grown in vitro under chlorhexidine pressure identified mutations in the gene mlaA coding for a phospholipid transport system. Phenotypic analyses of single-gene mutant from the Keio collection confirmed the role of this mutation in the decreased susceptibility to chlorhexidine. However, mutations in mlaA were not found in isolates from large clinical collections. In contrast, genome wide association studies (GWAS) showed that, in clinical strains, chlorhexidine reduced susceptibility was associated with the presence of tetA genes of class B coding for efflux pumps and located in a Tn10 transposon. Construction of recombinant strains in E. coli K-12 confirmed the role of tetA determinant in acquired resistance to both chlorhexidine and tetracycline. Our results reveal two different evolutionary paths leading to chlorhexidine decreased susceptibility: one restricted to in vitro evolution conditions and involving a retrograde phospholipid transport system; the other observed in clinical isolates associated with efflux pump TetA. None of these mechanisms provides cross-resistance to colistin or to the cationic surfactant octenidine. This work demonstrates the GWAS power to identify new resistance mechanisms in bacterial species.","Royer, G.; Ortiz De La Rosa, J.-M.; Vuillemin, X.; Lacombe, B.; Chau, F.; Clermont, O.; Mercier-Darty, M.; Decousser, J.-W.; Ricard, J.-D.; Nordmann, P.; Denamur, E.; Poirel, L.",2021-10-05,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.10.05.463149,1,Erick  Denamur,INSERM,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.05.463149v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.05.463149v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,193766,Impact of fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides on P. aeruginosa virulence factor production and cytotoxicity,"Infection from the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide and the world health organisation has listed it with the highest priority for the need of new antimicrobial therapies. P. aeruginosa strains responsible for the poorest clinical outcomes express either ExoS or ExoU, which are injected into target host cells via the type III secretion system (T3SS). ExoS is a bifunctional cytotoxin that promotes intracellular survival of invasive P. aeruginosa by preventing targeting of the bacteria to acidified intracellular compartments and lysosomal degradation. ExoU is a potent phospholipase which causes rapid destruction of host cell plasma membranes, leading to acute tissue damage and bacterial dissemination. Fluoroquinolones are usually employed as a first line of therapy as they have been shown to be more active against P. aeruginosa in vitro than other antimicrobial classes. However, their overuse over the past decade has caused alarming rates of antibiotic resistance to emerge. In certain clinical situations, aminoglycosides have been shown to be more effective then fluoroquinolones, despite their reduced potency towards P. aeruginosa in vitro. In this study, we evaluated the effects of fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and aminoglycosides (tobramycin and gentamycin) on T3SS expression and toxicity, in corneal epithelial cell infection models. We discovered tobramycin disrupted T3SS expression and inhibited both ExoS and ExoU mediated cytotoxicity, protecting infected HCE-T cells even at concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC). Fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin and ciprofloxacin, however, upregulated the T3SS and in particular did not subvert the cytotoxic effects of ExoS and ExoU.","Foulkes, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,194554,Long-term evolution of antibiotic persistence in P. aeruginosa lung infections,"Pathogenic bacteria respond to antibiotic pressure with the evolution of resistance but survival can also depend on their ability to tolerate antibiotic treatment, known as persistence. While a variety of resistance mechanisms and underlying genetics are well characterised in vitro and in vivo, the evolution of persistence, and how it interacts with resistance in situ is less well understood. We assayed for persistence and resistance with three clinically relevant antibiotics: meropenem, ciprofloxacin and tobramycin, in isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from chronic cystic fibrosis lung infections spanning up to forty years of evolution. We find evidence that persistence is under positive selection in the lung and that it can particularly act as an evolutionary stepping stone to resistance. However, this pattern is not universal and depends on the bacterial clone type and antibiotic used, indicating an important role for antibiotic mode of action.","Ghoul, M.; Andersen, S.

C. elegans have been collected from around the world, where they, presumably, adapted to regional microbial ecologies. Here we use survival assays and RNA- sequencing to better understand how two isolates from disparate climates respond to pathogenic bacteria. We found that, relative to N2 (originally isolated in Bristol, UK), CB4856 (isolated in Hawaii), was more susceptible to the Gram-positive pathogen, Staphylococcus epidermidis, but equally susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus as well as two Gram-negative pathogens, Providencia rettgeri and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We performed transcriptome analysis of infected worms and found gene- expression profiles were considerably different in an isolate-specific and pathogen-specific manner. We performed GO term analysis to categorize differential gene expression in response to S. epidermidis. In N2, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes and extracellular matrix proteins were significantly enriched, while in CB4856, genes that encoded detoxification enzymes, C-type lectins, and lipid metabolism proteins were enriched, suggesting they have different responses to these bacterial pathogens, despite being the same species. Overall, discerning gene expression signatures in an isolate by pathogen manner can help us to understand the different possibilities for the evolution of immune responses within organisms.","Lansdon, P.; Carlson, M.; Ackley, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,194706,Fast bacterial growth reduces antibiotic accumulation and efficacy,"Phenotypic variations between individual microbial cells play a key role in the resistance of microbial pathogens to pharmacotherapies. Nevertheless, little is known about cell individuality in antibiotic accumulation. Here we hypothesize that phenotypic diversification can be driven by fundamental cell-to-cell differences in drug transport rates. To test this hypothesis, we employed microfluidics-based single-cell microscopy, libraries of fluorescent antibiotic probes and mathematical modelling. This approach allowed us to rapidly identify phenotypic variants that avoid antibiotic accumulation within populations of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Staphylococcus aureus. Crucially, we found that fast growing phenotypic variants avoid macrolide accumulation and survive treatment without genetic mutations. These findings are in contrast with the current consensus that cellular dormancy and slow metabolism underlie bacterial survival to antibiotics. Our results also show that fast growing variants display significantly higher expression of ribosomal promoters before drug treatment compared to slow growing variants. Drug-free active ribosomes facilitate essential cellular processes in these fast growing variants, including efflux that can reduce macrolide accumulation. Using this new knowledge, we phenotypically engineered bacterial populations by eradicating variants that displayed low antibiotic accumulation through the chemical manipulation of their outer membrane inspiring new avenues to overcome current antibiotic treatment failures.","Łapinska, U.; Voliotis, M.; Lee, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,194939,Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome P450 CYP168A1 is a fatty acid hydroxylase that metabolizes arachidonic acid to the vasodilator 19-HETE,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative opportunistic human pathogen that is highly prevalent in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). A major problem in treating CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa is the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, the identification of novel P. aeruginosa antibiotic drug targets is of the upmost urgency. The genome of P. aeruginosa contains four putative cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) of unknown function that have never before been characterized. Analogous to some of the CYPs from M. tuberculosis, the P. aeruginosa CYPs may be important for growth and colonization of the CF patients lung. In this study, we cloned, expressed, and characterized CYP168A1 from P. aeruginosa and identified it as a sub-terminal fatty acid hydroxylase. Spectral binding data and computational modeling of substrates and inhibitors suggest that CYP168A1 has a large, expansive active site preferring long chain fatty acids and large hydrophobic inhibitors. Furthermore, metabolism experiments confirm that the enzyme is capable of hydroxylating arachidonic acid, an important inflammatory signaling molecule present in abundance in the CF lung, to 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (19-HETE; Km = 41.1 {micro}M, Vmax = 222 pmol/min/nmol P450), a potent vasoconstrictor which may play a role in the pathogens ability to colonize the mammalian lung. Metabolism of arachidonic acid is subject to substrate inhibition and is also inhibited by the presence of ketoconazole. This study points to the discovery of a new potential drug target that may be of utility in treating drug resistant P. aeruginosa.","Tooker, B. C.; Kandel, S. E.; Work, H. M.; Lampe, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,195183,Non-motile subpopulations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa repress flagellar motility in motile cells through a type IV pili- and Pel-dependent mechanism,"The downregulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellar motility is a key event in biofilm formation, host-colonization, and the formation of microbial communities, but the external factors that repress motility are not well understood. Here, we report that under swarming conditions, swarming motility can be repressed by cells that are non-motile due to the absence of a flagellum or flagellar rotation. Non-swarming cells, due to mutations that prevent either flagellum biosynthesis or rotation, present at 5% of the total population suppressed swarming of wild-type cells under the conditions tested in this study. Non-swarming cells required functional type IV pili and the ability to produce Pel exopolysaccharide to suppress swarming by the flagellated wild type. In contrast, flagellated cells required only type IV pili, but not Pel production, in order for swarming to be repressed by non-flagellated cells. We hypothesize that interactions between motile and non-motile cells may enhance the formation of sessile communities including those involving multiple genotypes, phenotypically-diverse cells, and perhaps other species.

ImportanceOur study shows that, under the conditions tested, a small population of non-swarming cells can impact the motility behavior of the larger population. The interactions that lead to the suppression of swarming motility require type IV pili and a secreted polysaccharide, two factors with known roles in biofilm formation. These data suggest that interactions between motile and non-motile cells may enhance the transition to sessile growth in populations and promote interactions between cells with different genotypes.","Lewis, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,195581,Systematic identification of molecular mediators underlying sensing of Staphylococcus aureus by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria typically exist in dynamic, multispecies communities where polymicrobial interactions influence fitness. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions is critical for understanding and modulating bacterial behavior in natural environments. While bacterial responses to foreign species are frequently characterized at the molecular and phenotypic level, the exogenous molecules that elicit these responses are understudied. Here we outline a systematic strategy based on transcriptomics combined with genetic and biochemical screens of promoter-reporters to identify the molecules from one species that are sensed by another. We utilized this method to study interactions between the pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus that are frequently found in co-infections. We discovered that P. aeruginosa senses diverse staphylococcal exoproducts including the metallophore staphylopine, intermediate metabolites citrate and acetoin, and multiple molecules that modulate its iron starvation response. Further, we show that staphylopine inhibits biofilm formation and that P. aeruginosa can utilize citrate and acetoin for growth, revealing that these interactions have both antagonistic and beneficial effects. Our screening approach thus identified multiple S. aureus secreted molecules that are sensed by P. aeruginosa and affect its physiology, demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, and yielding new insight into the molecular basis of interactions between these two species.","Zarrella, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,196272,In vitro reconstituted quorum sensing pathways enable rapid evaluation of quorum sensing inhibitors,"Quorum sensing, as inner- or inter-species microbial communication process orchestrated by diffusible autoinducers, typically results in collective pathogenic behaviours, being recognized as a promising druggable target for anti-virulence. Here, we reconstituted las and rhl quorum sensing pathways of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mediated by acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) and LuxI/LuxR-family proteins, with fluorescence output in Escherichia coli cell-free expression system, offering a platform to rapidly evaluate quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) in vitro. Previously reported small-molecule quorum sensing inhibitors for interfering with P. aeruginosa quorum sensing systems were tested and showed mild to high on-target inhibition as well as off-target toxicity. Of note, quercetin displayed potent on-target inhibition to quorum sensing pathways as well as acceptable off-target toxicity to cell-free expression machinery. Upon our work, cell-free platform is anticipated to further facilitate automated and high-throughput drug screening, bridge in silico and in vivo drug-screening methods, and accelerate the upgrading of antimicrobial arsenal.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198380,In Silico Prediction and Comparison of Resistomes in Model Pseudomonas Strains by Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI),"1.ABSTRACTSPseudomonas is a genus of bacteria including strains of human and plant pathogens, plant-growth promoting and biological control agents. While most Pseudomonas strains are known resistant to several antibiotics, their genetic elements conferring antimicrobial resistance (AMR) are largely unexplored systematically. The current study exploits a robust AMR gene predicting tool Resistance Gene Identifier of most recently updated version 5.2.0 based on newly curated database (the Comprehensive Antibiotic Research Database version 3.1.3) to detect AMR genes from thirteen genomes of Pseudomonas strains affiliated with seven species, including twelve pseudomonads as popularly studied model strains plus a well-known Pseudomonas protegens CHA0. A list of 281 AMR genes have been detected in five genomes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while 32 in the rest Pseudomonas spp. strains. Among the species, P. aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, P. protegens and P. stutzeri have the resistome of multi-drug resistance, while the rest is resistant to narrower spectrum of drugs. All Pseudomonas spp. investigated here have resistance genes to antibiotics classes of fluoroquinolone and tetracycline, which is consistent with an antibiotic resistance gene hit of adeF (ARO No. 3000777, resistant to fluoroquinolone, tetracycline) has found in high redundancy in almost all Pseudomonas species except P. aeruginosa and P. stutzeri, implying the limit of these classes of drugs for treating pseudomonads. While interspecies data were focused here, further analysis will be conducted to reveal the features of inter-strain level features of pseudomonads. The in silico analysis will complement wet-lab research for designing treating strategies of these bacteria.","Kwatra, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198530,Pseudomonas synergizes with fluconazole against Candida during treatment of polymicrobial infection,"Polymicrobial infections are challenging to treat because we dont fully understand how pathogens interact during infection and how these interactions affect drug efficacy. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are opportunistic pathogens that can be found in similar sites of infection such as in burn wounds and most importantly in the lungs of CF and mechanically ventilated patients. C. albicans is particularly difficult to treat because of the paucity of antifungal agents, some of which lack fungicidal activity. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of anti-fungal treatment during C. albicans-P. aeruginosa co-culture in vitro and co-infection in the mucosal zebrafish infection model analogous to the lung. We find that P. aeruginosa enhances the activity of fluconazole (FLC), an anti-fungal drug that is fungistatic in vitro, to promote both clearance of C. albicans during co-infection in vivo and fungal killing in vitro. This synergy between FLC treatment andbacterial antagonism is partly due to iron piracy, as it is reduced upon iron supplementation and knockout of bacterial siderophores. Our work demonstrates that FLC has enhanced activity in clinically relevant contexts and highlights the need to understand antimicrobial effectiveness in the complex environment of the host with its associated microbial communities.","Hattab, S.; Dagher, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198774,HSP90 modulates T2R bitter taste receptor nitric oxide production and innate immune responses in human airway epithelial cells and macrophages,"Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types including ciliated airway epithelial cells and macrophages. T2Rs in these two airway innate immune cell types are activated by bitter products, including some secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to Ca2+-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). NO enhances mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial effects in ciliated epithelial cells and increases phagocytosis by macrophages. Using biochemistry and live cell imaging, we explored the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in regulating T2R-dependent NO pathways in primary sinonasal epithelial cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages, and a human bronchiolar cell line (H441). We used immunofluorescence to show that H441 cells express eNOS and certain T2Rs and that the bitterant denatonium benzoate activates NO production in an HSP90-dependent manner in cells grown either as submerged cultures and at air liquid interface. In primary sinonasal epithelial cells, we determined that HSP-90 inhibition reduces T2R-stimulated NO production and ciliary beating which are crucial for pathogen clearance. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that HSP-90 is integral to T2R-stimulated NO production and phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Escherichia coli and pHrodo-Staphylococcus aureus. Our study demonstrates that HSP90 serves an innate immune role by regulating NO production downstream of T2R signaling by augmenting eNOS activation without impairing upstream calcium signaling. These findings suggest that HSP90 plays an important role in airway antibacterial innate immunity and may be an important target in airway diseases like chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, or cystic fibrosis.","Carey, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198620,An assessment of the evidence for antibacterial activity of stinging nettle (Urtica dioica) extracts,"Stinging nettles (Urtica spp.) have been used in a diverse range of traditional and historical medicines from around the world for the treatment of skin diseases, wounds, urinary disorders, respiratory diseases, bone and joint pain, anaemia and other circulatory problems, as well as in cosmetic preparations for skin and haircare. As part of an interdisciplinary exploration of nettle-based remedies, we performed a systematic review of published evidence for the antimicrobial activity of Urtica spp. extracts against bacteria and fungi that commonly cause skin, soft tissue and respiratory infections. We focussed on studies in which minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays of U. dioica were conducted on the common bacterial opportunistic pathogens Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. No studies used fresh leaves (all were dried prior to use), and no studies prepared nettles in weak acid (corresponding to vinegar) or in fats/oils, which are common combinations in historical and traditional preparations. We addressed this gap by conducting new antibacterial tests of extracts of fresh U. dioica leaves prepared in vinegar, butter or olive oil against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Our systematic review and additional experimental data leads us to conclude that there is no strong evidence for nettles containing molecules with clinically useful antimicrobial activity. It seems most likely that the utility of nettles in traditional topical preparations for wounds may simply be as a ""safe"" absorbent medium for keeping antibacterial (vinegar) or emollient (oils) ingredients at the treatment site.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198874,Identification of antibiotic resistance proteins via MiCId's augmented workflow. A mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach,"Fast and accurate identifications of pathogenic bacteria along with their associated antibiotic resistance proteins are of paramount importance for patient treatments and public health. While mass spectrometry has become an important, technique for diagnostics of infectious disease, there is a need for mass spectrometry workflows offering this capability. To meet this need, we have augmented the previously published Microorganism Classification and Identification (MiCId) workflow for this capability. To evaluate the performance of the newly augmented MiCId workflow, we have used MS/MS datafiles from samples of 10 antibiotic resistance bacterial strains belonging to three different species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The evaluation results show that MiCIds workflow has a sensitivity value around 85% (with a lower bound at about 72%) and a precision greater than 95% in the identification of antibiotic resistance proteins. Using MS/MS datasets from samples of two bacterial clonal isolates, one being antibiotic-sensitive while the other (obtained from the same patient at different times) being multidrug-resistant, we applied MiCIds workflow to investigate possible mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in these pathogenic bacteria; the results showed that MiCIds conclusions are in agreement with the published study. Furthermore, we show that MiCIds workflow is fast. It pro-vides microorganismal identifications, protein identifications, sample biomass estimates, and antibiotic resistance protein identifications in 6-17 minutes per MS/MS sample using computing resources that are available in most desktop and laptop computers, making it a highly portable workflow. This study demonstrated that MiCIds workflow is fast, portable, and with high sensitivity and high precision, making it a valuable tool for rapid identifications of bacteria as well as detection of their antibiotic resistance proteins.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,198681,Bacterial competition systems share a domain required for inner membrane transport of the nuclease bacteriocin pyocin G,"Bacteria exploit a variety of attack strategies to gain dominance within ecological niches. Prominent amongst these are contact-dependent inhibition (CDI), type VI secretion (T6SS) and bacteriocins. The cytotoxic endpoint of these systems is often the delivery of a nuclease to the cytosol. How such nucleases translocate across the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is unknown. Here, we identify a small, conserved, 15-kDa domain, which we refer to as the inner membrane translocation (IMT) domain that is common to T6SS and bacteriocins and linked to nuclease effector domains. Through fluorescence microscopy assays using intact and spheroplasted cells, we demonstrate that the IMT domain of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa specific bacteriocin pyocin G (PyoG) is required for import of the toxin nuclease domain to the cytoplasm. We also show that translocation of PyoG into the cytosol is dependent on inner membrane proteins FtsH, a AAA+ATPase/protease, and TonB1, the latter more typically associated with transport of bacteriocins across the outer membrane. Our study reveals that the IMT domain directs the cytotoxic nuclease of PyoG to cross the cytoplasmic membrane and, more broadly, has been adapted for the transport of other toxic nucleases delivered into Gram-negative bacteria by both contact dependent- and contact-independent means.

ImportanceNuclease bacteriocins are potential antimicrobials for the treatment of antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. While the mechanism of outer membrane translocation is beginning to be understood, the mechanism of inner membrane transport is not known. This study uses PyoG as a model nuclease bacteriocin and defines a conserved domain which is essential for inner membrane translocation and which is widespread in other bacterial competition systems. Additionally, the presented data links two membrane proteins, FtsH and TonB1, with inner membrane translocation of PyoG. These findings point to the general importance of this domain to the cellular uptake mechanisms of nucleases delivered by otherwise diverse and distinct bacterial competition systems. The work is also of importance for the design of new protein antibiotics.","Atanaskovic, I.; Sharp, C.; Press, C.; Kaminska, R.; Kleanthous, C.",2021-11-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.11.17.469063,1,Colin  Kleanthous,University of Oxford,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.17.469063v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.17.469063v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,199221,"reComBat: Batch effect removal in large-scale, multi-source omics data integration","MotivationWith the steadily increasing abundance of omics data produced all over the world under vastly different experimental conditions residing in public databases, a crucial step in many data-driven bioinformatics applications is that of data integration. The challenge of batch-effect removal for entire databases lies in the large number of batches and biological variation which can result in design matrix singularity. This problem can currently not be solved satisfactorily by any common batch-correction algorithm.

ResultsWe present reComBat, a regularized version of the empirical Bayes method to overcome this limitation and benchmark it against popular approaches for the harmonization of public gene expression data (both microarray and bulkRNAsq) of the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Batch-effects are successfully mitigated while biologically meaningful gene expression variation is retained. reComBat fills the gap in batch-correction approaches applicable to large-scale, public omics databases and opens up new avenues for data-driven analysis of complex biological processes beyond the scope of a single study.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,199311,Co-Delivery of Synergistic Antimicrobials with Polyelectrolyte Nanocomplexes to Treat Bacterial Biofilms and Lung Infections,"New approaches are needed to treat bacterial biofilm infections, particularly those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which have high rates of antimicrobial resistance and are commonly found in chronic wound and cystic fibrosis lung infections. Combination therapeutics that act synergistically can overcome resistance; however, the delivery of multiple therapeutics at relevant dosages remains a challenge. We therefore developed a new nanoscale drug carrier for antimicrobial co-delivery by combining approaches from polyelectrolyte nanocomplex (NC) formation and layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly. This strategy led to NC drug carriers loaded with tobramycin antibiotics and antimicrobial silver nanoparticles (AgTob-NCs). AgTob-NCs displayed synergistic enhancements in antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and biofilm PA cultures, with positively charged NCs leading to complete biofilm eradication. NCs were evaluated in mouse models of lung infection, leading to reduced bacterial burden and improved survival outcomes. This approach therefore shows promise for nanoscale therapeutic co-delivery to overcome antimicrobial resistant bacterial infections.","Finbloom, J. A.; Raghavan, P.; Kwon, M.; Kharbikar, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,199389,Discovering Novel Antimicrobial Peptides in Generative Adversarial Network,"Due to the growing number of clinical antibiotic resistance cases in recent years, novel antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can become ideal for next-generation antibiotics. This study trained a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (GAN) with known AMPs to generate novel AMP candidates. The quality of the GAN-designed peptides was evaluated in silico, and eight of them named GAN-pep 1[~]8 were chosen to be synthesized for further experiments. Disk diffusion testing and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination were used to determine the antibacterial effects of the synthesized GAN-designed peptides. Seven out of the eight synthesized GAN-designed peptides showed antibacterial activities.

Additionally, GAN-pep 3 and GAN-pep 8 had a broad spectrum of antibacterial effects. Both of them were also effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). GAN-pep 3, the most promising GAN-designed peptide candidate, had low MICs against all the tested bacteria.","Lin, T.-T.; Yang, L.-Y.; Wang, C.-T.; Lai, G.-W.; Ko, C.-F.; Shih, Y.-H.; Chen, S.-H.; Lin, C.-Y.",2021-11-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.11.22.469634,1,Chung-Yen  Lin,"INSTITUTE OF INFORMATION SCIENCE, ACADEMIA SINICA, TAIWAN",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.22.469634v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.22.469634v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,200567,Redox-active secondary metabolites act as interspecies modulators of antibiotic resilience,"Bacterial opportunistic pathogens make a wide range of secondary metabolites both in the natural environment and when causing infections, yet how these molecules mediate microbial interactions and their consequences for antibiotic treatment are still poorly understood. Here, we explore the role of two redox-active secondary metabolites, pyocyanin and toxoflavin, as interspecies modulators of antibiotic resilience. We find that these molecules dramatically change susceptibility levels of diverse bacteria to clinical antibiotics. Pyocyanin is made by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while toxoflavin is made by Burkholderia gladioli, organisms that infect cystic fibrosis and other immunocompromised patients. Both molecules alter the susceptibility profile of pathogenic species within the ""Burkholderia cepacia complex"" to different antibiotics, either antagonizing or potentiating their effects, depending on the drugs class. Defense responses regulated by the redox-sensitive transcription factor SoxR potentiate the antagonistic effects these metabolites have against fluoroquinolones, and the presence of genes encoding SoxR and the efflux systems it regulates can be used to predict how these metabolites will affect antibiotic susceptibility of different bacteria. Finally, we demonstrate that inclusion of secondary metabolites in standard protocols used to assess antibiotic resistance can dramatically alter the results, motivating the development of new tests for more accurate clinical assessment.","Meirelles, L.

Tactoids of filamentous Pf bacteriophage, such as those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been linked with increased antibiotic tolerance. We modelled this system and show that tactoids, composed of filamentous Pf virions, can lead to antibiotic tolerance by acting as an adsorptive diffusion barrier. The continuum model, reminiscent of descriptions of reactive diffusion in porous media, has been solved numerically and good agreement was found with the analytical results, obtained using a homogenisation approach. We find that the formation of tactoids significantly increases antibiotic diffusion times leading to stronger antibiotic resistance.","Van Rossem, M. T.; Wilks, S.; Kaczmarek, M.; Secor, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,201607,The role of surface adhesion on the macroscopic wrinkling of biofilms,"Biofilms, bacterial communities of cells encased by a self-produced matrix, exhibit a variety of three-dimensional structures. Specifically, channel networks formed within the bulk of the biofilm have been identified to play an important role in the colonies viability by promoting the transport of nutrients and chemicals. Here, we study channel formation and focus on the role of the adhesion of the biofilm matrix to the substrate in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown under constant flow in microfluidic channels. We perform phase contrast and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the development of the biofilm structure as a function of the substrates surface energy. The formation of the wrinkles and folds is triggered by a mechanical buckling instability, controlled by biofilm growth rate and the films adhesion to the substrate. The three-dimensional folding gives rise to hollow channels that rapidly increase the overall volume occupied by the biofilm and facilitate bacterial movement inside them. The experiments and analysis on mechanical instabilities for the relevant case of a bacterial biofilm grown during flow enable us to predict and control the biofilm morphology.","Geisel, S.; Secchi, E.; Vermant, J.",2021-12-10,Biophysics,10.1101/2021.12.09.471895,1,Jan  Vermant,ETH Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.09.471895v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.09.471895v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.7554/eLife.76027
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,201447,The contrasting roles of nitric oxide drive microbial community organization as a function of oxygen presence,"Microbial assemblages are omnipresent in the biosphere, forming communities on the surfaces of roots, rocks, and within living tissues. These communities can exhibit strikingly beautiful compositional structures, with certain members reproducibly occupying particular spatiotemporal microniches. Despite this reproducibility, we lack the ability to explain these spatial patterns. We hypothesize that certain spatial patterns in microbial communities may be explained by the exchange of redox-active metabolites whose biological function is sensitive to microenvironmental gradients. To test this, we developed a simple community consisting of synthetic Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with a partitioned denitrification pathway: a strict consumer and strict producer of nitric oxide (NO), a key pathway intermediate. Because NO can be both toxic or beneficial depending on the amount of oxygen present, this system provided an opportunity to investigate whether dynamic oxygen gradients can tune metabolic cross-feeding and fitness outcomes in a predictable fashion. Using a combination of genetic analysis, controlled growth environments and imaging, we show that oxygen availability dictates whether NO cross-feeding is deleterious or mutually beneficial, and that this organizing principal maps to the microscale. More generally, this work underscores the importance of considering the contrasting and microenvironmentally tuned roles redox-active metabolites can play in shaping microbial communities.","Wilbert, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,202272,The ColR/S two-component system is a conserved determinant of host association across Pseudomonas species,"Members of the bacterial genus Pseudomonas form mutualistic, commensal and pathogenic associations with diverse hosts. The prevalence of host association across the genus suggests that symbiosis may be a conserved ancestral trait and that distinct symbiotic lifestyles may be more recently evolved. Here we show that the ColR/S two-component system, part of the Pseudomonas core genome, is functionally conserved between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Using plant rhizosphere colonization and virulence in a murine abscess model, we show that colR is required for commensalism with plants and virulence in animals. Comparative transcriptomics revealed that the ColR regulon has diverged between P. aeruginosa and P. fluorescens and deleting components of the ColR regulon revealed strain-specific, but not hostspecific, requirements for ColR-dependent genes. Collectively, our results suggest that ColR/S allows Pseudomonas to sense and respond to a host, but that the ColR-regulon has diverged between Pseudomonas strains with distinct lifestyles.","Wiesmann, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,202354,Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilises host-derived polyamines to facilitate antimicrobial tolerance,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes diversification during infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung. Understanding these changes requires model systems that capture the complexity of the CF lung environment. We previously identified loss-of-function mutations in the two-component regulatory system sensor kinase gene pmrB, in P. aeruginosa from CF and from experimental infection of mice. Here, we demonstrate that whilst such mutations lower in vitro MICs for multiple antimicrobial classes, this is not reflected in increased antibiotic susceptibility in vivo. Loss of PmrB impairs aminoarabinose modification of lipopolysaccharide, increasing the negative charge of the outer membrane and promoting uptake of cationic antimicrobials. However, in vivo, this can be offset by increased membrane binding of other positively charged molecules present in lungs. The polyamine spermidine readily coats the surface of PmrB-deficient P. aeruginosa, reducing susceptibility to antibiotics that rely on charge differences to bind the outer membrane and increasing biofilm formation. Spermidine is elevated in lungs during P. aeruginosa infection in mice and during episodes of antimicrobial treatment in people with CF. These findings highlight the need to study antimicrobial resistance under clinically relevant environmental conditions. Microbial mutations carrying fitness costs in vitro may be advantageous during infection, where host resources can be utilised.","Hasan, C. M.; Green, A.; Cox, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203169,Genetic and transcriptomic characteristics of RhlR-dependent quorum sensing in cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"In people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF), bacterial infections involving the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. P. aeruginosa uses a cell-cell signaling mechanism called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate many virulence functions. One type of QS consists of acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals produced by LuxI-type signal synthases, which bind a cognate LuxR-type transcription factor. In laboratory strains and conditions, P. aeruginosa employs two AHL synthase/receptor pairs arranged in a hierarchy, with the LasI/R system controlling the RhlI/R system and many downstream virulence factors. However, P. aeruginosa isolates with inactivating mutations in lasR are frequently isolated from chronic CF infections. We and others have shown that these isolates frequently use RhlR as the primary QS regulator. RhlR is rarely mutated in CF and environmental settings. We were interested if there were reproducible genetic characteristics of these isolates and if there was a central group of genes regulated by RhlR in all isolates. We examined five isolates and found signatures of adaptation common to CF isolates. We did not identify a common genetic mechanism to explain the switch from Las-to Rhl-dominated QS. We describe a core RhlR regulon encompassing 20 genes encoding 7 products. These results suggest a key group of QS-regulated factors important for pathogenesis of chronic infection, and position RhlR as a target for anti-QS therapeutics. Our work underscores the need to sample a diversity of isolates to understanding QS beyond what has been described in laboratory strains.","Asfahl, K. L.; Smalley, N. E.; Chang, A. P.; Dandekar, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203019,Suicidal chemotaxis in bacteria,"Bacteria commonly live in communities on surfaces where steep gradients of antibiotics and other chemical compounds routinely occur. While many species of bacteria can move on surfaces, we know surprisingly little about how such antibiotic gradients affect cell motility. Here we study the behaviour of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in stable spatial gradients of a range of antibiotics by tracking thousands of cells in microfluidic devices as they form biofilms. Unexpectedly, these experiments reveal that individual bacteria use pili-based ( twitching) motility to actively navigate towards regions with higher antibiotic concentrations. Our analyses suggest that this biased migration is driven, at least in part, by a direct response to the antibiotics. Migrating cells can reach antibiotic concentrations hundreds of times higher than their minimum inhibitory concentration in a few hours and remain highly motile. However, isolating these cells - using fluid-walled microfluidic devices that can be reconfigured in situ - suggests that these bacteria are terminal and not able to reproduce. In spite of moving towards their death, we show that migrating cells are capable of entering a suicidal program to release bacteriocins that are used to kill other bacteria. Our work suggests that bacteria respond to antibiotics as if they come from a competing colony growing in the neighbourhood, inducing them to invade and attack. As a result, clinical antibiotics have the potential to serve as a bait that lures bacteria to their death.","Oliveira, N. M.; Wheeler, J. H. R.; Deroy, C.; Booth, S. C.; Walsh, E. J.; Durham, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,202996,Molecular features underlying Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence in human plasma,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen, is a leading cause of bacteremia with a high mortality rate. We recently reported that P. aeruginosa forms a persister-like sub-population of evaders in human plasma and blood. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of evaders remained unknown. Here, using a gain-of-function genetic screen, we examined the molecular determinants of P. aeruginosa persistence in plasma. We found that, among other factors, ATP and biotin availability greatly influence bacterial survival in plasma; mutants in pur and bio genes display higher tolerance and persistence, respectively. Electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) revealed the formation of polyphosphate granules upon incubation in plasma in several clinical strains, implying the bacterial response to a low-energy stress signal. Indeed, mutants with transposon insertions in ppk genes were eliminated in the plasma. Analysis of several steps of the complement cascade and exposure to an outer-membrane-impermeable drug, nisin, suggested that the mutants impede membrane attack complex (MAC) activity per se. Through this study, we shed light on P. aeruginosa response to the plasma conditions and discovered the multifactorial origin of bacterial resilience to MAC that provides a comprehensive picture of the complex interplay between P. aeruginosa and the human complement system.

Author summaryPersistence of bacterial pathogens is a main cause of treatment failure and establishment of chronic bacterial infection. Despite innate immune responses, some bacteria may persist in human blood and plasma. Here we used a genome-wide screen to investigate the molecular determinants influencing Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence in human plasma facing the complement system. Alongside a multifactorial strategy, we found intracellular levels of ATP and biotin to significantly influence bacterial capacity to deal with membrane attack complex (MAC)-dependent killing. These results underline the need to understand the complex interplay between bacterial pathogens and the human immune system when seeking to develop efficient antibacterial strategies.","Janet-Maitre, M.; Pont, S.; Masson, F.; Sleiman, S.; Trouillon, J.; Robert-Genthon, M.; Gallet, B.; Dumestre-Perard, C.; Elsen, S.; Moriscot, C.; Bardoel, B.; Rooijakkers, S.; Cretin, F.; Attree, I.",2022-09-20,Microbiology,10.1101/2021.12.21.473675,3,Ina  Attree,IBS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.21.473675v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.21.473675v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203544,Polyphosphate affects cytoplasmic and chromosomal dynamics in nitrogen-starved Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Polyphosphate (polyP) synthesis is a ubiquitous stress and starvation response in bacteria. In diverse species, mutants unable to make polyP have a wide variety of physiological defects, but the mechanisms by which this simple polyanion exerts its effects remain unclear. One possibility is that polyPs many functions stem from global effects on the biophysical properties of the cell. We characterize the effect of polyphosphate on cytoplasmic mobility under nitrogen-starvation conditions in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking, we characterize the motion of chromosomal loci and free tracer particles in the cytoplasm. In the absence of polyP and upon starvation, we observe an increase in mobility both for chromosomal loci and for tracer particles. Tracer particles reveal that polyP also modulates the partitioning between a  more mobile and a  less mobile population: small particles in cells unable to make polyP are more likely to be  mobile and explore more of the cytoplasm, particularly during starvation. We speculate that this larger freedom of motion may be a consequence of nucleoid decompaction, which we also observe in starved cells deficient in polyP. Our observations suggest that polyP limits cytoplasmic mobility and accessibility during nitrogen starvation, which may help to explain the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in the absence of polyP.","Magkiriadou, S.; Habel, A.; Stepp, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203457,Structure and mechanism of a cytosine transport protein,"CodB is a cytosine transporter from the Nucleobase-Cation-Symport-1 (NCS1) transporter family, a member of the widespread LeuT superfamily. Previous experiments with the nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown CodB also to be important in the uptake of 5-fluorocytosine, which has been suggested as a novel drug to combat antimicrobial resistance by suppressing virulence in the organism. Here we solve the crystal structure of CodB from Proteus vulgaris, at 2.4[A] resolution in complex with cytosine. We show that the protein carries out the sodium-dependent uptake of cytosine and can bind 5-fluorocytosine. Comparison of the substrate-bound structures of CodB and the hydantoin transporter Mhp1, the only other NCS1 family member for which the structure is known, highlight the importance of the hydrogen bonds that the substrates make with the main chain at the breakpoint in the discontinuous helix, TM6. In contrast to other LeuT superfamily members, neither CodB nor Mhp1 make specific interactions with residues on TM1. Comparison of the structures provides insight into the intricate mechanisms of how these proteins transport substrates across the plasma membrane.","Hatton, C. E.; Brotherton, D. H.; Cameron, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203350,Reconfigurable microfluidic circuits for isolating and retrieving cells of interest,"Microfluidic devices are widely used in many fields of biology, but a key limitation is that cells are typically surrounded by solid walls, making it hard to access those that exhibit a specific phenotype for further study. Here, we provide a general and flexible solution to this problem that exploits the remarkable properties of microfluidic circuits with fluid walls - transparent interfaces between culture media and an immiscible fluorocarbon that are easily pierced with pipets. We provide two proofs-of-concept in which specific cell sub-populations are isolated and recovered: i) murine macrophages chemotaxing towards complement component 5a, and ii) bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in developing biofilms that migrate towards antibiotics. We build circuits in minutes on standard Petri dishes, add cells, pump in laminar streams so molecular diffusion creates attractant gradients, acquire time-lapse images, and isolate desired sub-populations in real-time by building fluid walls around migrating cells with an accuracy of tens of micrometres using 3D-printed adaptors that convert conventional microscopes into wall-building machines. Our method allows live cells of interest to be easily extracted from microfluidic devices for downstream analyses.","Deroy, C.; Wheeler, J. H. R.; Rumianek, A. N.; Cook, P. R.; Durham, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,203612,Evaluating mono and combination therapy of meropenem and amikacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia in the Hollow-Fiber Infection Model,"Debate continues as to the role of combination antibiotic therapy for the management of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. We studied extent of bacterial killing and resistance emergence of meropenem and amikacin as monotherapy and as a combination therapy against susceptible and resistant P. aeruginosa isolates from bacteremic patients using the dynamic in vitro hollow-fiber infection model. Three P. aeruginosa isolates (meropenem MICs 0.125, 0.25 & 64 mg/L) were used simulating bacteremia with an initial inoculum ~1x105 CFU/mL and the expected pharmacokinetics of meropenem and amikacin in critically ill patients. For isolates susceptible to amikacin and meropenem (isolates 1 and 2), the rate of bacterial killing was increased with the combination regimen when compared with monotherapy of either antibiotic. Both the combination and meropenem monotherapy were able to sustain bacterial killing throughout the seven-day treatment course, whereas regrowth of bacteria occurred with amikacin monotherapy after 12 hours. For the meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolate (isolate 3), only the combination regimen demonstrated bacterial killing. Given that tailored antibiotic regimens can maximize potential synergy against some isolates, future studies should explore the benefit of combination therapy against resistant P. aeruginosa.","Avent, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,204380,The ESKAPE mobilome contributes to the spread of antimicrobial resistance and CRISPR-mediated conflict between mobile genetic elements,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) mediate the shuffling of genes among organisms. They contribute to the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes in human pathogens, such as the particularly problematic group of ESKAPE pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter sp. Here, we performed the first systematic analysis of MGEs, including plasmids, prophages, and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs), in the ESKAPE pathogens. We characterized over 1700 complete ESKAPE genomes and found that different MGE types are asymmetrically distributed across these pathogens. While some MGEs are capable of exchanging DNA beyond the genus (and phylum) barrier, most horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events are restricted by phylum or genus. We show that the MGEs proteome is involved in diverse functional processes and distinguish widespread proteins within the ESKAPE context. Moreover, anti-CRISPRs and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes are overrepresented in the ESKAPE mobilome. Our results also underscore species-specific trends shaping the number of MGEs, AMR, and virulence genes across pairs of conspecific ESKAPE genomes with and without CRISPR-Cas systems. Finally, we found that CRISPR targets vary according to MGE type: while plasmid and prophage CRISPRs almost exclusively target other plasmids and prophages, respectively, ICEs/IME CRISPRs preferentially target prophages. Overall, our study highlights the general importance of the ESKAPE mobilome in contributing to the spread of AMR and mediating conflict among MGEs.","Botelho, J.; Cazares, A.; Schulenburg, H.",2022-07-12,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.01.03.474784,2,João  Botelho,"Antibiotic Resistance Evolution Group, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen, Germany; Department of Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, Zoologica",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.474784v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.474784v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,204469,Pathogens in exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis differ in sensitivity to silver nanoparticles,"PurposeThe significance of the microbiome in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is not clear. Antimicrobials are recommended in acute exacerbations of the disease (AECRS). Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance stimulate research on alternative therapeutic options including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), sometimes referred to as ""colloidal silver"". However, there are concerns regarding the safety of silver administration and the emergence of silver resistance. The aim of this cross-sectional observational study was to assess the sensitivity of sinonasal pathogens to AgNPs and compare it with the toxicity of AgNPs for nasal epithelial cells.

MethodsNegatively charged AgNPs (12{+/-}5 nm) were synthetized using tannic acid. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for pathogens isolated from patients with AECRS was approximated. Cytotoxicity of AgNPs was tested in vitro on human nasal epithelial cells line.

Results48 clinical isolates and 4 reference strains were included in the study (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Acinetobacter baumanii, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae). The MIC values differed between isolates, even within the same species. All the isolates (including antibiotic resistant) were sensitive to AgNPs in concentrations nontoxic to human cells during 24 h exposition. However, 48 h exposition to AgNPs increased toxicity to human cells, narrowing their therapeutic window and enabling 19% of pathogens to resist the AgNPs biocidal action.

ConclusionsAgNPs are effective against most pathogens isolated from patients with AECRS, but sensitivity testing may be necessary before application. Results of sensitivity testing for reference strains cannot be extrapolated to other strains of the same species.","Szaleniec, J.; Gibala, A.; Stalinska, J.; Ocwieja, M.; Zeliszewska, P.; Drukala, J.; Szaleniec, M.; Gosiewski, T.",2022-09-19,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.01.03.474872,2,Joanna  Szaleniec,Jagiellonian University Medical College,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.474872v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.03.474872v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,204465,Isolation and Identification of taxonomically diverse bacterial endophytes from citrus in Punjab Pakistan,"Citrus is an economically important fruit crop grown in all provinces of Pakistan, while Punjab accounting for 95 percent of total production due to its favorable climate for citrus production. Commercially grown varieties in Pakistan include sweet oranges, grapefruits, Mandarine, Lime, and lemon. The goal of this research was to see how diverse the cultivable bacterial populations are found in citrus cultivars. Out of 90 isolated cultures, 37 endophytic bacterial species and 15 different genera of bacteria were characterized based on morphological, biochemical, and molecular methods from citrus leaves. All the isolated bacteria were subjected to PCR amplification through 16S rDNA followed by sequencing. RDP base classification revealed that class Bacilli has the largest percentage of isolates, whereas class Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Proteobacteria have the lowest percentage among all genotypes used. According to the findings, the phylum Firmicutes contains a common genus (Brevibacterium, 1%; Enterococcus, 6%; Staphylococcus, 7% and Bacillus, 60%). Alpha (Rhizobium) beta (Burkholderia cepacia; Comamonas terigena) gamma Proteobacteria (Enterobacter hermachei (1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1%), Proteus mirabilis (8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5%), Psychrobacter pulmonis and Yersinia molalretti (1%) respectively. These results revealed that cultivars of the plants might contribute to the structure and endophytic bacterial communities associated with citrus. Endophytes extracted from leaf samples of different citrus cultivars in Pakistan are reported for the first time. The idea of employing endophytes bacteria to produce enzymes stimulate plant growth, and its purpose as a biological control agent will be investigated in the future.","Atta, S.",2022-01-04,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2022.01.04.474905,1,Sagheer  Atta,Ghazi University Dera Ghazi Khan,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.04.474905v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.04.474905v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,204902,Polymer-directed inhibition of reversible to irreversible attachment prevents Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation,"Non-toxic, biocompatible materials that inhibit bacterial biofilm formation on implanted medical devices and so prevent infection are urgently required. Weakly amphiphilic acrylate polymers with rigid hydrocarbon pendant groups resist bacterial biofilm formation in vitro and in vivo but the biological mechanism involved is not known. By comparing biofilm formation on polymers with the same acrylate backbone but with different pendant groups, we show that poly(ethylene glycol dicyclopentenyl ether acrylate; pEGdPEA) but not neopentyl glycol propoxylate diacrylate (pNGPDA) inhibited the transition from reversible to irreversible attachment. By using single-cell tracking algorithms and controlled flow microscopy we observed that fewer Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells accumulated on pEGdPEA compared with pNGPDA. Bacteria reaching the pEGdPEA surface exhibited shorter residence times and greater asymmetric division with more cells departing from the surface post-cell division, characteristic of reversible attachment. Migrating cells on pEGdPEA deposited fewer exopolysaccharide trails and were unable top adhere strongly. Discrimination between the polymers required type IV pili and flagella. On pEGdPEA, the lack of accumulation of cyclic diguanylate or expression of sadB were consistent with the failure to transit from reversible to irreversible attachment. Constitutive expression of sadB increased surface adhesion sufficient to enable P. aeruginosa to form biofilms in a Mot flagellar stator dependent manner. These findings were extendable to other biofilm resistant acrylates highlighting their unique ability to inhibit reversible to irreversible attachment as a mechanism for preventing biofilm-associated infections.

SignificanceBacteria readily attach to surfaces forming biofilms. These are commonly associated with medical device-associated infections and highly refractory to antibiotics. Biocompatible, weakly amphiphilic acrylate polymers with large hydrophobic pendant groups that inhibit biofilm formation and can prevent such infections have been described. However, the biological mechanism involved is not understood. By comparing a biofilm-inhibiting with a biofilm-supporting acrylate, we showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 cells responded differentially to the two polymers and were unable to accumulate and adhere strongly, activate cyclic diguanylate signalling or transit from reversible to irreversible attachment on the inhibitory polymer. Constitutive expression of sadB increased surface adhesion sufficient to enable P. aeruginosa to form biofilms in a flagellar stator dependent manner overcoming the biofilm inhibitory properties of the polymer.","Carabelli, A.; Dubern, J.-F.; Papangeli, M.; Farthing, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,205009,Monomodular Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage JG004 lysozyme (Pae87) contains a bacterial surface-active antimicrobial peptide-like region and a possible substrate-binding subdomain,"Phage lysins are a source of novel antimicrobials to tackle the bacterial antibiotic resistance crisis. The engineering of phage lysins is being explored as a game-changing technological strategy for introducing a more precise approach in the way we apply antimicrobial therapy. Such engineering efforts will benefit from a better understanding of lysin structure and function. In this work, the antimicrobial activity of the endolysin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage JG004, termed Pae87, has been characterized. This lysin had been previously identified as an antimicrobial agent candidate, able to interact with the Gram-negative surface and disrupt it. Further evidence is hereby provided on this matter, based on a structural and biochemical study. A high-resolution crystal structure of Pae87 complexed with a peptidoglycan fragment showed a separate substrate-binding region within the catalytic domain, 18 [A] away from the catalytic site and located at the opposite side of the lysin molecule. This substrate binding region was conserved among phylogenetically related lysins lacking an additional cell wall binding domain, but not among those containing such a module. Two glutamic acids were identified as relevant for the peptidoglycan degradation activity, although Pae87 antimicrobial activity was seemingly unrelated to it. In contrast, an antimicrobial peptide-like region within Pae87 C-terminus, named P87, was found to be able to actively disturb the outer membrane and have antibacterial activity by itself. Therefore, we propose an antimicrobial mechanism for Pae87 in which the P87 peptide plays the role of binding to the outer membrane and disrupting the cell wall function, either with or without the participation of Pae87 catalytic activity.

SynopsisThe structure of the monomodular Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage JG004 lysin Pae87 is presented and investigated in relationship with its function repurposed as an antimicrobial agent. The structure with its peptidoglycan ligand revealed a possible cell wall binding region. A C-terminal antimicrobial peptide-like region is shown to be important for disrupting the bacterial cell wall.","Vazquez, R.; Seoane-Blanco, M.; Rivero-Buceta, V.; Ruiz, S.; Van Raaij, M.

Pathogenic microorganisms virulence mechanisms seem to have a significant impact on their pathogenesis. The purpose of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity of the ethanol and methanol fractions of Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae leaf extract, as well as its effect on the expression level of virulence-associated genes.

The extracts fractions were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae (clinical), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans ATCC 90029. The test organisms antibiogram pattern was determined. The extracts attenuation effect on the target genes of the susceptible organisms was investigated employing relative quantification using RT-qPCR. The test organisms antibiogram pattern revealed that it was drug-resistant, intermediate, and sensitive. The extracts tested positive for antimicrobial activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans ATCC 90029, with zones of inhibition varying from 20.33 to 29 mm. The lowest recorded MIC value was 4.688 mg/ml, while the highest was 37.5 mg/ml. In contrast to the methanol extract, the ethanol extract had a cidal action at a lower dose. The ethanol extracts Sub-MIC (18.25 mg/ml) merely reduced the expression of the hly gene in MRSA. The MRSA virulence genes were not suppressed by the sub-MIC of methanol extract (18.25 mg/ml). Notably, the expression of als1, pbl1, and sap1 in Candida albicans ATCC 90029 was significantly attenuated when exposed to sub-MICs of ethanol extract (2,344 mg/ml) and methanol extract (9.375 mg/ml).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,205512,Common Dynamic Determinants Govern Quorum Quenching Activity in N-terminal Serine Hydrolases,"Growing concerns about microbial antibiotic resistance have motivated extensive research into ways of overcoming antibiotic resistance. Quorum quenching (QQ) processes disrupt bacterial communication via quorum sensing, which enables bacteria to sense the surrounding bacterial cell density and markedly affects their virulence. Due to its indirect mode of action, QQ is believed to exert limited pressure on essential bacterial functions and may thus avoid inducing resistance. Although many enzymes display QQ activity against various bacterial signaling molecules, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood, limiting their potential optimization as QQ agents. Here we evaluate the capacity of three N-terminal serine hydrolases to degrade N-acyl homoserine lactones that serve as signaling compounds for Gram-negative bacteria. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the free enzymes and their complexes with two signaling molecules of different lengths, followed by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics molecular dynamics simulations of their initial catalytic steps, we clarify the molecular processes underpinning their QQ activity. We conclude that all three enzymes degrade bacterial signaling molecules via similar reaction mechanisms. Moreover, we experimentally confirmed the activity of two penicillin G acylases from Escherichia coli (ecPGA) and Achromobacter spp. (aPGA), adding these biotechnologically well-optimized enzymes to the QQ toolbox. We also observed enzyme- and substrate-dependent differences in the catalytic actions of these enzymes, arising primarily from the distinct structures of their acyl-binding cavities and the dynamics of their molecular gates. As a consequence, the first reaction step catalyzed by ecPGA with a longer substrate had an elevated energy barrier because its shallow acyl binding site could not accommodate a productive substrate-binding configuration. Conversely, aPGA in complex with both substrates exhibited unfavorable energetics in both reaction steps due to the dynamics of the residues gating the acyl binding cavity entrance. Finally, the energy barriers of the second reaction step catalyzed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa acyl-homoserine lactone acylase with both substrates were higher than in the other two enzymes due to the unique positioning of Arg297{beta} in this enzyme. The discovery of these dynamic determinants will guide future efforts to design robust QQ agents capable of selectively controlling virulence in resistant bacterial species.","Surpeta, B.; Grulich, M.; Palyzova, A.; Maresova, H.; Brezovsky, J.",2022-01-28,Biochemistry,10.1101/2022.01.13.476167,2,Jan  Brezovsky,"Laboratory of Biomolecular Interactions and Transport, Department of Gene Expression, Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, Adam",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.13.476167v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.13.476167v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1021/acscatal.2c00569
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,205624,Metabolic basis for the evolution of a common pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa variant,"Microbes frequently evolve in reproducible ways. Here, we show that differences in specific metabolic regulation explain the frequent presence of lasR loss-of-function mutations in the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. While LasR contributes to virulence, lasR mutants have been associated with more severe disease. A model based on the intrinsic growth kinetics for a wild type strain and its LasR- derivative, in combination with an experimental evolution based genetic screen and further genetics analyses, indicated that differences in metabolism were sufficient to explain the rise of these common mutant types. The evolution of LasR- lineages in laboratory and clinical isolates depended on activity of the two-component system CbrAB, which modulates substrate prioritization through the catabolite repression control pathway. LasR- lineages frequently arise in cystic fibrosis lung infections and their detection correlates with disease severity. Our analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid metabolomes identified compounds that negatively correlate with lung function, and we show that these compounds support enhanced growth of LasR- cells in a CbrB-controlled manner.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206078,Low diversity and instability of the sinus microbiota over time in adults with cystic fibrosis,"BackgroundChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common, yet underreported and understudied manifestation of upper respiratory disease in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are currently no standard of care guidelines for the management of CF CRS, but treatment of upper airway disease may ameliorate lower airway disease. We sought to inform future treatment guidelines by determining whether changes to sinus microbial community diversity and specific taxa known to cause CF lung disease are associated with increased respiratory disease and inflammation.

MethodsWe performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing, supplemented with cytokine analyses, microscopy, and bacterial culturing, on samples from the sinuses of 27 adults with CF CRS at the University of Pittsburghs CF Sinus Clinic. At each study visit, participants underwent endoscopic paranasal sinus sampling and clinical evaluation. We identified key drivers of microbial community composition and evaluated relationships between diversity and taxa with disease outcomes and inflammation.

FindingsSinus community diversity was low and the composition was unstable, with many participants exhibiting alternating dominance between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococci over time. Despite a tendency for dominance by these two taxa, communities were highly individualized and shifted composition during exacerbation of sinus disease symptoms. Exacerbations were also associated with communities dominated by Staphylococcus spp. Reduced microbial community diversity was linked to worse sinus disease and the inflammatory status of the sinuses (including increased IL-1{beta}). Increased IL-1{beta} was also linked to worse sinus endoscopic appearance, and other cytokines were linked to microbial community dynamics.

InterpretationTo our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal study of microbial communities and cytokine secretion in CF CRS. Our work revealed previously unknown instability of sinus microbial communities and a link between inflammation, lack of microbial community diversity, and worse sinus disease.

Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSA search of the PubMed database on October 11, 2021 with the terms [cystic fibrosis sinus microbiome] yielded 16 results, and we have identified seven primary research articles on the CF CRS microbiome (including re-analyses of existing datasets). Most are cross-sectional cohort analyses, along with one prior longitudinal study of four adults at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Together, these prior studies reveal similarities between CF CRS and CF sputum microbiomes, including low community diversity associated with sinus disease, the presence of common CF-associated microbes in the sinuses, and prevalence of sinus communities dominated by P. aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. High levels of IL-1{beta} are linked to the presence of nasal polyps in CF CRS, and polymorphisms in the IL-1 receptor antagonist gene are associated with risk of CRS outside of the context of CF. Two prior studies of this cohort have been performed by our laboratory. One describes clinical indicators of CF sinus disease and the other links sinus infection biogeography to P. aeruginosa evolutionary genomics.

Added value of this studyOur study is the first to examine longitudinal relationships between the host immune response (through cytokine profiling) and microbiota dynamics in CF CRS, including linking elevated IL-1{beta} to worse sinus disease through reduced sinus microbial community diversity. The longitudinal nature of our study also allowed us to uncover striking temporal instability of microbial communities in approximately half of our cohorts sinus microbial communities over two years, including switching between communities dominated by P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus spp. This instability could hinder attempts to link the relative abundance of taxa to clinical outcomes of interest in cross-sectional studies (e.g., markers of disease progression). We also identified patterns of synergy and antagonism between specific taxa, and impacts of the host immune response in the sinuses on community composition.

Implications of all the available evidenceTogether with prior CF CRS microbiome studies, our study underscores similarities between sinus and lower respiratory tract microbial community structure in CF, and we show how community structure tracks with inflammation and several disease measures. This work strongly suggests that clinical management of CRS could be leveraged to improve overall respiratory health in CF. Our work implicates elevated IL-1{beta} in reduced microbiota diversity and worse sinus disease in CF CRS, suggesting applications for existing therapies targeting IL-1{beta}. Finally, the widespread use of highly effective CFTR modulator therapy has led to less frequent availability of spontaneous expectorated sputum for microbiological surveillance of lung infections. A better understanding of CF sinus microbiology could provide a much-needed alternative site for monitoring respiratory infection status by important CF pathogens.","Armbruster, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206067,Enterococcus faecalis antagonizes Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth in polymicrobial biofilms,"Enterococcus faecalis is often co-isolated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in polymicrobial biofilm-associated infections of wounds and the urinary tract. As a defense strategy, the host innately restricts iron availability at infection sites. Despite their co-prevalence, the polymicrobial interactions of these two pathogens in iron- restricted conditions, such as those found in the host, remains unexplored. Here we show that E. faecalis inhibits P. aeruginosa growth within biofilms when iron is restricted. E. faecalis lactate dehydrogenase (ldh1) gives rise to L-lactate production during fermentative growth. We find that E. faecalis ldh1 mutant fails to inhibit P. aeruginosa growth. Additionally, we demonstrate that ldh1 expression is induced in iron-restricted conditions, resulting in increased lactic acid exported and consequently, a reduction in pH. Together, our results suggest that E. faecalis synergistically inhibit P. aeruginosa growth by decreasing environmental pH and L-lactate-mediated iron chelation. Overall, this study highlights that the microenvironment in which the infection occurs is important for understanding its pathophysiology.

IMPORTANCEMany infections are polymicrobial and biofilm-associated in nature. Iron is essential for many metabolic processes and plays an important role in controlling infections, where the host restricts iron as a defense mechanism against invading pathogens. However, polymicrobial interactions between pathogens are underexplored in iron- restricted conditions. Here, we explore the polymicrobial interactions between commonly co-isolated E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa within biofilms. We find that E. faecalis modulates the microenvironment by exporting lactic acid which further chelates already limited iron, and also lowers the environmental pH to antagonize P. aeruginosa growth in iron-restricted conditions. Our findings provide insights into polymicrobial interactions between pathogens in an infection-relevant condition and how manipulating the microenvironment can be taken advantage of to better control infections.","Tan, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206421,PopB-PcrV Interactions are Essential for Pore Formation in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Type III Secretion System Translocon,"The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a syringe-like virulence factor which delivers bacterial proteins directly into the cytoplasm of host cells. An essential component of the system is the translocon, which creates a pore in the host cell membrane through which proteins are injected. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the translocation pore is formed by proteins PopB and PopD and attaches to the T3SS needle via the needle tip protein PcrV. The pore is multimeric, but the exact stoichiometry and structure of the pore are unknown. We took a genetic approach to map contact points within the system by taking advantage of the fact that the translocator proteins of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the related Aeromonas hydrophila T3SS are incompatible and cannot be freely exchanged. We created chimeric versions of P. aeruginosa PopB and A. hydrophila AopB to intentionally disrupt and restore protein-protein interactions. We identified a chimeric B-translocator that specifically breaks an interaction with the needle tip protein and interferes with the formation of the translocation pore. Breaking the interaction did not disrupt membrane insertion, arguing that the needle tip protein chaperones formation of the translocation pore.","Kundracik, E. C.; Trichka, J.; Diaz Aponte, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206857,DciA helicase operators exhibit diversity across bacterial phyla,"A fundamental requirement for life is the replication of an organisms DNA. Studies in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have set the paradigm for DNA replication in bacteria. During replication initiation in E. coli and B. subtilis, the replicative helicase is loaded onto the DNA at the origin of replication by an ATPase helicase loader. However, most bacteria do not encode homologs to the helicase loaders in E. coli and B. subtilis. Recent work has identified the DciA protein as a predicted helicase operator that may perform a function analogous to the helicase loaders in E. coli and B. subtilis. DciA proteins, which are defined by the presence of a DUF721 domain (termed the DciA domain herein), are conserved in most bacteria but have only been studied in mycobacteria and {gamma}-proteobacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Vibrio cholerae). Sequences outside of the DciA domain in Mycobacterium tuberculosis DciA are essential for protein function but are not conserved in the P. aeruginosa and V. cholerae homologs, raising questions regarding the conservation and evolution of DciA proteins across bacterial phyla. To comprehensively define the DciA protein family, we took a computational evolutionary approach and analyzed domain architectures and sequence properties of DciA-domain containing proteins across the tree of life. These analyses identified lineage-specific domain architectures amongst DciA homologs as well as broadly conserved sequence-structural motifs. The diversity of DciA proteins represents the evolution of helicase operation in bacterial DNA replication and highlights the need for phylum-specific analyses of this fundamental biological process.

IMPORTANCEDespite the fundamental importance of DNA replication for life, this process remains understudied in bacteria outside of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In particular, most bacteria do not encode the helicase loading proteins that are essential in E. coli and B. subtilis for DNA replication. Instead, most bacteria encode a DciA homolog that likely constitutes the predominant mechanism of helicase operation in bacteria. However, it is still unknown how DciA structure and function compare across diverse phyla that encode DciA proteins. In this study, we perform computational evolutionary analyses to uncover tremendous diversity amongst DciA homologs. These studies provide a significant advance in our understanding of an essential component of the bacterial DNA replication machinery.","Blaine, H. C.; Burke, J. T.; Ravi, J.; Stallings, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206882,Computationally efficient assembly of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene expression compendium,"Over the past two decades, thousands of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) gene expression profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been made publicly available via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). In the work we present here, we draw on over 2,300 P. aeruginosa transcriptomes from hundreds of studies performed by over seventy-five different research groups. We first developed a pipeline, using the Salmon pseudo-aligner and two different P. aeruginosa reference genomes (strains PAO1 and PA14), that transformed raw sequence data into a uniformly processed data in the form of sample-wise normalized counts. In this workflow, P. aeruginosa RNA-seq data are filtered using technically and biologically driven criteria with characteristics tailored to bacterial gene expression and that account for the effects of alignment to different reference genomes. The filtered data are then normalized to enable cross experiment comparisons. Finally, annotations are programmatically collected for those samples with sufficient meta-data and expression-based metrics are used to further enhance strain assignment for each sample. Our processing and quality control methods provide a scalable framework for taking full advantage of the troves of biological information hibernating in the depths of microbial gene expression data. The re-analysis of these data in aggregate is a powerful approach for hypothesis generation and testing, and this approach can be applied to transcriptome datasets in other species.

SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa causes a wide range of infections including chronic infections associated with cystic fibrosis. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat and people with CF-associated P. aeruginosa infections often have poor clinical outcomes. To aid the study of this important pathogen, we developed a methodology that facilitates analyses across experiments, strains, and conditions. We aligned, filtered for quality and normalized thousands of P. aeruginosa RNA-seq gene expression profiles that were publicly available via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The workflow that we present can be efficiently scaled to incorporate new data and applied to the analysis of other species.","Doing, G.; Lee, A. J.; Neff, S. L.; Holt, J. D.; Stanton, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,207076,Reversible adhesion by type IV pili leads to formation of irreversible localized clusters,"Despite the fact a fundamental first step in the physiopathology of many disease-causing bacteria is the formation of long-lived, localized, multicellular clusters, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the cluster formation process, particularly on host tissues, remains poorly understood. Experiments on abiotic surfaces suggest that the colonization of a surface by swimming bacteria requires i) irreversible adhesion to the surface, ii) cell proliferation, and iii) a phenotypic transition from an initial planktonic state. Here, we investigate how Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infects a polarized MDCK epithelium and show that contrary to what has been reported on the colonization of abiotic surfaces, PA forms irreversible bacterial clusters on apoptotic epithelial cell without requiring irreversible adhesion, cell proliferation, or a phenotypic transition. By combining experiments and a mathematical model, we reveal that the cluster formation process is regulated by type IV pili (T4P). Furthermore, we unveil how T4P quantitatively operate during adhesion on the biotic surface, finding that it is a stochastic process that involves an activation time, requires the retraction of pili, and results in reversible adhesion with a characteristic attachment time. Using a simple kinetic model, we explain how such reversible adhesion process leads to the formation of irreversible bacterial clusters and quantify the cluster growth dynamics.","Pepe, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,206961,"Phage Paride hijacks bacterial stress responses to kill dormant, antibiotic-tolerant cells","Bacteriophages are fierce viral predators with no regard for pathogenicity or antibiotic resistance of their bacterial hosts1,2. Despite early recognition of their therapeutic potential and the current escalation of bacterial multidrug resistance, phages have so far failed to become a regular treatment option in clinical practice3-5. One reason is the occasional discrepancy between poor performance of selected phages in vivo despite high potency in vitro3,4,6,7. Similar resilience of supposedly drug-sensitive bacterial infections to antibiotic treatment has been linked to persistence of dormant cells inside patients8,9. Given the abundance of non-growing bacteria also in the environment10,11, we wondered whether some phages can infect and kill these antibiotic-tolerant cells. As shown previously12-16, most phages failed to replicate on dormant hosts and instead entered a state of hibernation or pseudolysogeny. However, we isolated a new Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage named Paride with the exciting ability to directly kill dormant, antibiotic-tolerant hosts by lytic replication, causing sterilization of deep-dormant cultures in synergy with the {beta}-lactam meropenem. Intriguingly, efficient replication of Paride on dormant hosts depends on the same bacterial stress responses that also drive antibiotic tolerance. We therefore suggest that Paride hijacks weak spots in the dormant physiology of antibiotic-tolerant bacteria that could be exploited as Achilles heels for the development of new treatments targeting resilient bacterial infections.","Maffei, E.; Burkolter, M.; Heyer, Y.; Egli, A.; Jenal, U.; Harms, A.",2022-01-26,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.01.26.477855,1,Alexander  Harms,"Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477855v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.01.26.477855v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,207120,Pyrrole produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa influences olfactory food choice of Caenorhabditis elegans,"Sense of smell can influence dietary choices in animals. So far, most of the research has focused on how animals respond to distinct odors when they are introduced individually. However, it remains unclear how animals evaluate foods that contain a bouquet of olfactory cues with contrasting effects. Here, we utilize Caenorhabditis elegans as a bacterivore to ask if odors produced by dietary bacteria can regulate worms food preferences. We show that the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces a relatively small quantity of a new attractant for C. elegans. We identify the odor as a heterocyclic compound called pyrrole. We find that pyrrole contributes to the sensory decision-making of worms in diet preference assays. Using specific neuronal ablation lines and calcium response assays, we show that AWA odor sensory neurons of worms are necessary for sensing pyrrole. In all, we show that specific odors produced by bacteria can influence food choice behavior of animals.","Prakash, D.; Siddiqui, R.; Chalasani, S.

Extensive characterization of films confirmed the presence of these substances, which differently interact with the polysaccharide polymer (pectin), plasticizer (glycerol), surfactant (Tween 60), and cross-linker (Ca2+), conferring to these films a unique structure. Besides, IntegroPectin-based films constitute sustained, controlled, and slow-release (up to 72h) systems for bioactive substances in an aqueous environment. This feature is crucial for the good in vitro antimicrobial activity exerted by IntegroPectin films against three Gram-negative bacteria (two indicator pathogen strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, P. aeruginosa PAO1, and the clinical isolate Klebsiella pneumoniae) that are involved in the global emergence of the antimicrobial resistance.","Piacenza, E.; Presentato, A.; Alduina, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,207781,Cilia stimulatory and antibacterial activities of bitter receptor agonist diphenhydramine: insights into potential complimentary strategies for CF nasal infections,"BACKGROUNDBitter compounds increase ciliary beating and nitric oxide (NO) production in nasal epithelial cells through T2Rs in motile cilia. We examined expression of cilia T2Rs and both host and bacterial responses to T2R14 agonist diphenhydramine.

METHODUsing cultured human nasal epithelial cells grown at air liquid interface, we measured expression of T2Rs via qPCR. We measured effects of diphenhydramine on ciliary beat frequency via high-speed imaging and nitric oxide production via fluorescent dye DAF-FM. We measured effects of diphenhydramine on growth of lab and clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We measured biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa using crystal violet staining and surface attachment of P. aeruginosa to cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CBFE41o-) cells using CFU counting.

RESULTST2R expression increased with mucocilliary differentiation and did not vary between CF and non-CF ALIs. Treatment with P. aeruginosa flagellin decreased expression of diphenhydramine-responsive T2R14 and 40, among other isoforms. Diphenhydramine increased both NO and CBF. Increases in CBF were disrupted after flagellin treatment. Diphenhydramine impaired growth, biofilm production, and surface attachment of P. aeruginosa.

CONCLUSIONST2R expression is similar between normal and CF cells but decreases with flagellin treatment. Utilizing T2R agonists as therapeutics within the context of CF, P. aeruginosa infections may require co-treatment with anti-inflammatories to prevent the reduction of T2R expression with TLR activation. T2R agonist diphenhydramine increases NO production and CBF while also decreasing bacterial growth and biofilm production, and thus diphenhydramine or derivate compounds may have potential clinical usefulness in CF infections as a topical therapy.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,207760,Activation of a bacterial flow sensor by hypochlorous acid from stimulated neutrophils,"Bacteria sense environmental stressors and activate responses to improve their survival in harsh growth conditions. Neutrophils respond to the presence of bacteria by producing oxidative antibacterial species including hypochlorous acid (HOCl). However, the extent that bacteria detect activated neutrophils or HOCl has not been known. Here, we report that the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa responds to activated neutrophils by activating the fro system, which regulates the expression of antioxidative factors. We show that this response is specific to HOCl and that other oxidative factors including H2O2, do not trigger a fro response. The fro system has been previously shown to detect flow that is present in host vasculature, such as in animal circulatory systems. Our data thus suggest a model in which fro serves as an early host detection system in P. aeruginosa that improves its survival against neutrophil-mediated defenses, which could promote colonization in human tissue and increase pathogenicity.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,207987,Synergistic Activity of Repurposed Peptide Drug Glatiramer Acetate with Tobramycin Against Cystic Fibrosis Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common pathogen infecting the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF), causing both acute and chronic infections. Intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance, coupled with the physical barriers resulting from desiccated CF sputum, allow P. aeruginosa to colonise and persist in spite of antibiotic treatment. As well as the specific difficulties in eradicating P. aeruginosa from CF lungs, P. aeruginosa is also subject to the wider, global issue of antimicrobial resistance. Glatiramer acetate (GA) is a peptide drug, used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), which has been shown to have moderate anti-pseudomonal activity. Other antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown to be antibiotic resistance breakers; potentiating the activities of antibiotics when given in combination restoring and/or enhancing antibiotic efficacy. Growth, viability, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)-determination and synergy analysis showed that GA improved the efficacy of TOB against reference strains of P. aeruginosa, reducing TOB MICs and synergising with the aminoglycoside. This was also the case for clinical strains from people with CF. GA significantly reduced the concentration of TOB required to inhibit 50% (MIC50) of viable cells (from 1.69 [95%CI 0.26-8.97] to 0.62 [95%CI 0.15-3.94] mg/L, p=0.002) and inhibit 90% (MIC90) (from 7.00 [95%CI 1.18-26.50] to 2.20 [95%CI 0.99-15.03] mg/L, p=0.001) compared with TOB-only. Investigating mechanisms of GA activity showed that GA resulted in significant disruption of outer membranes, depolarisation of cytoplasmic membranes and permeabilisation of P. aeruginosa and was the only agent tested (including cationic AMPs) to significantly affect all three.","Murphy, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,208489,Light/dark and temperature cycling modulate metabolic electron flow in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms,"Sunlight drives phototrophic metabolism, which affects redox conditions and produces substrates for non-phototrophs. These environmental parameters fluctuate daily due to Earths rotation, and non-phototrophic organisms can therefore benefit from the ability to respond to, or even anticipate, such changes. Circadian rhythms, such as daily changes in body temperature, in host organisms can also affect local conditions for colonizing bacteria. Here, we investigated the effects of light/dark and temperature cycling on biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. We grew biofilms in the presence of a respiratory indicator dye and found that greater dye reduction occurred in biofilm zones that formed during dark intervals and at lower temperatures. This pattern formation occurred with cycling of blue, red, or far-red light, and a screen of mutants representing potential sensory proteins identified two with defects in pattern formation, specifically under red light cycling. We also found that the physiological states of biofilm subzones formed under specific light and temperature conditions were retained during subsequent condition cycling. Light/dark and temperature cycling affected expression of genes involved in primary metabolic pathways and redox homeostasis, including those encoding electron transport chain components. Consistent with this, we found that cbb3-type oxidases contribute to dye reduction under light/dark cycling conditions. Together, our results indicate that cyclic changes in light exposure and temperature have lasting effects on redox metabolism in biofilms formed by a non-phototrophic, pathogenic bacterium.

IMPORTANCEOrganisms that do not obtain energy from light can nevertheless be affected by daily changes in light exposure. Many aspects of animal and fungal physiology fluctuate in response to these changes, including body temperature and the activities of antioxidant and other redox enzymes that play roles in metabolism. Whether redox metabolism is affected by light/dark and temperature cycling in bacteria that colonize such circadian organisms has not been studied in detail. Here we show that growth under light/dark and temperature cycling leads to rhythmic changes in redox metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and identify proteins involved in this response.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209144,Polymorphic ribonucleoprotein folding as a basis for translational regulation,"The widely occurring bacterial RNA chaperone Hfq is a key factor in the post-transcriptional control of hundreds of genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. How this broadly acting protein can contribute to the regulation requirements of so many different genes remains puzzling. Here, we describe the structures of higher-order assemblies formed on control regions of different P. aeruginosa target mRNAs by Hfq and its partner protein Crc. Our results show that these assemblies have mRNA-specific quaternary architectures resulting from the combination of multivalent protein-protein interfaces and recognition of patterns in the RNA sequence. The structural polymorphism of the ribonucleoprotein assemblies enables selective translational repression of many different target mRNAs. This system suggests how highly complex regulatory pathways can evolve and be rewired with a simple economy of proteinogenic components.

These complexes impact on translation of hundreds of transcripts in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Assemblies with different quaternary structures result from the interactions of the proteins with sequence motifs and structural elements in different mRNA targets, as well as from a repertoire of protein-to-protein interfaces. In this way, the combination of RNA sequence and two proteins can generate the diversity required to regulate many genes. It is proposed that the multi-step assembly process is highly cooperative and most likely competes kinetically with translation initiation to silence the targeted transcripts.","Dendooven, T.; Sonnleitner, E.; Blasi, U.; Luisi, B.",2022-02-12,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2022.02.11.480102,1,Ben  Luisi,University of Cambridge,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.480102v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.480102v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209454,RNA targeting with CRISPR-Cas13a facilitates bacteriophage genome engineering,"The viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages (or phages), possess numerous genes of unknown function. Genetic tools are required to understand their biology and enhance their efficacy as antimicrobials. Pseudomonas aeruginosa jumbo phage {Phi}KZ and its relatives are a broad host range phage family that assemble a proteinaceous ""phage nucleus"" structure during infection. Due to the phage nucleus, DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas is ineffective against this phage and thus there are currently no reverse genetic tools for this family. Here, we develop a DNA phage genome editing technology using the RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13a enzyme as a selection tool, an anti-CRISPR gene (acrVIA1) as a selectable marker, and homologous recombination. Precise insertion of foreign genes, gene deletions, and the addition of chromosomal fluorescent tags into the {Phi}KZ genome were achieved. Deletion of phuZ, which encodes a tubulin-like protein that centers the phage nucleus during infection, led to the mispositioning of the phage nucleus but surprisingly had no impact on phage replication, despite a proposed role in capsid trafficking. A chromosomal fluorescent tag placed on gp93, a proposed ""inner body"" protein in the phage head revealed a protein that is injected with the phage genome, localizes with the maturing phage nucleus, and is massively synthesized around the phage nucleus late in infection. Successful editing of two other phages that resist DNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems [OMKO1 ({Phi}KZ-like) and PaMx41] demonstrates the flexibility of this method. RNA-targeting Cas13a system holds great promise for becoming a universal genetic editing tool for intractable phages. This phage genetic engineering platform enables the systematic study of phage genes of unknown function and the precise modification of phages for use in a variety of applications.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209418,Linking CFTR modulators to opportunistic bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators improve clinical outcomes with variable efficacy in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, changes produced by bacterial persistence and adaptation in addition to antibiotic regimens could influence CFTR modulator efficacy and vice versa and hence clinical outcomes. We first evaluated the effects of ivacaftor (IVA), lumacaftor (LUM), tezacaftor, elexacaftor and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI), alone or combined with antibiotics, on sequential Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa CF isolates. IVA and ETI showed the most potent direct antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, while P. aeruginosa was not affected. Additive effects or synergies were observed between the CFTR modulators and antibiotics against both S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, independently of the stage of colonization. IVA and LUM were the most effective in potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus, while IVA and ETI enhanced mainly polymyxins activity against P. aeruginosa. Next, we evaluated the effect of P. aeruginosa pneumonia on the pharmacokinetics of IVA in mice. The time-concentration curves of IVA and its metabolites in plasma, lung and epithelial lining fluid were influenced by P. aeruginosa infection. The area under the concentration-time curve showed that airway exposure to IVA was greater in infected than non-infected mice. These results suggest that CFTR modulators can have direct antimicrobial properties and/or enhance antibiotic activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, bacterial infection impacts the IVA concentration and airway exposure, potentially affecting its efficacy. Our findings suggest optimizing host- and pathogen-directed drug regimens to improve efficacy for personalized treatment.","Cigana, C.; Giannella, R.; Colavolpe, A.; Alcalá-Franco, B.; Mancini, G.; Colombi, F.; Bigogno, C.; Bastrup, U.; Bertoni, G.; Bragonzi, A.",2022-02-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.02.15.478594,1,Cristina  Cigana,"Infections and Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Division of Immunology, Transplantation and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.478594v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.478594v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209570,Antibacterial potency of Type VI amidase effector toxins is dependent on substrate topology and cellular context,"Members of the bacterial T6SS amidase effector (Tae) superfamily of toxins are delivered between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a high-throughput in vivo genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of tae1 toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.","Radkov, A.; Sapiro, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209555,Mechanoregulation of biofilm architecture promotes Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibiotic tolerance.,"In the wild, bacteria are most frequently found in the form of multicellular structures called biofilms1. Biofilms grow at the surface of abiotic and living materials with wide-ranging mechanical properties. Despite their co-occurrence during infection, we still lack a clear understanding of how mechanics regulate biofilm architecture and the physiology of resident bacteria. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilms on indwelling medical device2 and on soft tissues including burn wounds and the airway mucosa3. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical properties of hydrogel material substrates define P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture. We show that hydrogel mesh size regulates twitching motility, a surface exploration mechanism priming biofilms, ultimately controlling the arrangement of single cells in the multicellular community. The resulting architectural transitions increase P. aeruginosas tolerance to colistin, a last resort antibiotic. Our results thereby establish material properties as a regulator of biofilm architecture and antibiotic efficacy.","Cont, A.; Vermeil, J.; Persat, A.",2022-02-16,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.02.16.480709,1,Alexandre  Persat,EPFL,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.16.480709v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.16.480709v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,209846,Substrate stiffness impacts early biofilm formation by modulating Pseudomonas aeruginosa twitching motility,"Surface-associated lifestyles dominate in the bacterial world. Large multicellular assemblies, called biofilms, are essential to the survival of bacteria in harsh environments, and are closely linked to antibiotic resistance in pathogenic strains. Biofilms stem from the surface colonization of a wide variety of substrates encountered by bacteria, from living tissues to inert materials. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the promiscuous opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa explores substrates differently based on their rigidity, leading to striking variations in biofilm structure, exopolysaccharides (EPS) distribution, strain mixing during co-colonization and phenotypic expression. Using simple kinetic models, we show that these phenotypes arise through a mechanical interaction between the elasticity of the substrate and the type IV pilus (T4P) machinery, that mediates the surface-based motility called twitching. Together, our findings reveal a new role for substrate softness in the spatial organization of bacteria in complex microenvironments, with far-reaching consequences on efficient biofilm formation.","Gomez Ho, S.; Bureau, L.; John, K.; Debarre, D.; Lecuyer, S.",2022-07-10,Biophysics,10.1101/2022.02.18.480999,2,Sigolene  Lecuyer,"Universite Lyon, ENS de Lyon, Universite Claude Bernard, CNRS, Laboratoire de Physique, F-69342, Lyon, France",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.480999v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.18.480999v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,210163,A phospholipase assay screen identifies synergistic inhibitors of the P. aeruginosa toxin ExoU,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide and the World Health Organisation has listed it with the highest priority for the need of new therapies. P. aeruginosa strains that express ExoU are implicated in the worst clinical outcomes. ExoU is phospholipase that is secreted by P. aeruginosa directly into the cytoplasm of target host cells, where its catalytic activity, directed towards plasma membranes, causes rapid cell lysis. Inhibition of ExoU may be a novel strategy to combat acutely cytotoxic ExoU expressing P. aeruginosa infections. Using an in vitro phospholipase assay, we performed a high throughput screen to identify compounds that might be repurposed as therapeutic ExoU inhibitors. We discovered a panel of compounds that appeared to inhibit ExoU through distinct mechanisms. Compound C prevented ExoU membrane localisation in HEK293T cells and caused colocalization with lysosomes, whereas compound D prevented PIP2 dependent oligomerisation of ExoU in vitro suggestive of synergistic action. Indeed, the concentrations required by compounds C and D to inhibit in vitro ExoU catalytic activity, when used in combination, was in the nanomolar region. In corneal scratch and infection assays, these compounds reduced ExoU mediated cytotoxicity, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy and lactate dehydrogenase release assays.","Foulkes, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,210840,Identification and characterisation of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates with atypical β-lactam susceptibility profiles using Orbitrap liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry,"There is significant interest in the possibility of predicting antibacterial drug susceptibility directly though the analysis of bacterial DNA or protein. We report the use of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii transformants to define baseline predictive rules for the {beta}- lactam susceptibility profiles of {beta}-lactamase positive clinical isolates. We then deployed a robust and reproducible shotgun proteomics methodology to identify {beta}-lactamase positivity and predict {beta}-lactam susceptibility by reference to our baseline predictive rules both in cultured bacteria and in extracts of culture-positive blood. Proteomics and whole genome sequencing then allowed us to characterise K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa isolates that differed from the expected {beta}-lactam susceptibility profile, iteratively expanding our predictive rules. Proteomics added considerable value over and above the information generated by whole genome sequencing, allowing for gene expression, not just gene presence to be considered. Specifically, in K. pneumoniae, we identified key differences between acrR and ramR regulatory mutations and compared the effects of OmpK36 Aspartate-Threonine or Glycine-Aspartate dipeptide porin insertions on susceptibility to cefepime and carbapenems. In P. aeruginosa, we identified differences in the gene expression effects of mexR versus nalC mutations and related these to differences in {beta}-lactam MICs against isolates hyper-producing AmpC {beta}-lactamase and or producing a metallo-{beta}-lactamase.","Takebayashi, Y.; Dulyayangkul, P.; Satapoomin, N.; Ismah, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,210953,Macrolide therapy in Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections causes uL4 ribosomal protein mutations leading to high-level resistance,"BackgroundCystic fibrosis (CF) patients have reduced mucociliary clearance resulting in recurring and chronic bacterial lung infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens to colonize the airways of CF patients and can persist in the lungs for decades. CF patients infected with P. aeruginosa are treated with macrolides to inhibit quorum sensing, mucoidity and has additional immunomodulatory effects. However, according to the EUCAST committee, P. aeruginosa is not susceptible to macrolides leaving resistance mechanisms largely overlooked.

MethodsUsing a modified susceptibility testing protocol, P. aeruginosa isolates harbouring a mutated uL4 ribosomal protein were tested for resistance against macrolide antibiotics. Quorum sensing related properties, alterations in proteome composition and ribosome subunits distribution were further analysed to characterize the effect of the uL4 mutations on the physiology of the bacteria.

FindingsSeveral uL4 mutations were identified in isolates from P. aeruginosa collections from various sources and geographical locations. Most of them mapped to the conserved loop region of uL4 and resulted in increased survival upon macrolide exposure. uL4 mutations did not negatively impact the physiology of the bacteria and greater concentrations of antibiotic were needed to inhibit the growth, reduce swimming motility, and induce redox sensitivity. Proteome analysis revealed that pathways involved in ribosome adaptation displayed altered expression levels possibly to compensate for the uL4 mutations, which changed the subunit distribution of the ribosome.

InterpretationMacrolides used against P. aeruginosa cause selection of macrolide resistant mutants which is a widespread - but uncharacterized - phenomenon. Using a modified susceptibility test, revealed that macrolides are indeed effective bacteriostatic antibiotics against P. aeruginosa and that this effect - along with macrolide-induced quorum sensing modulation - are drastically reduced in uL4 mutants. Macrolide antibiotics should, therefore, be considered as active antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa and resistance development should be contemplated especially when patients are treated with prolonged courses of macrolides.

Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSMacrolide antibiotics are readily prescribed as anti-inflammatory therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients. This treatment strategy has largely overlooked the direct antimicrobial effect of this drug class on this pathogen, which is considered non-susceptible according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. This is because standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing is sub-optimal for the quantification of macrolide minimum inhibitory concentrations due to the interference of the growth medium. Mutations in ribosomal RNA and increased efflux has been shown to reduce the effect of macrolides on P. aeruginosa, however, the involvement of ribosomal proteins has not been investigated in P. aeruginosa. Work done in other bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Neisseria gonorrhoeae has identified the ribosomal proteins uL4 and uL22 as targets for evolved macrolide resistance in vitro and in vivo. Especially the extended loop region of uL4 has been identified as important for macrolide susceptibility. We found no other studies published addressing the emergence of macrolide resistance through uL4 or uL22 mutations in P. aeruginosa.

Added value of this studyWe present evidence that macrolide antibiotics used as anti-inflammatory agents and bacterial modulators against P. aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients cause the emergence of resistant strains through mutations in the ribosomal protein uL4. The importance of this finding is underlined by the identification of uL4 mutations in multiple strains not only within our strain collection comprised of CF associated isolates but throughout all available sequences of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates spanning several continents and different infection types. uL4 mutations resulted in significantly reduced susceptibility towards macrolide antibiotics with respect to bacteriostatic and quorum sensing modulation effects. The generation time in presence of macrolide antibiotics was unaffected in strains harbouring uL4 mutations, while it was reduced in wild type strains indicating a fitness advantage of the mutation.

Implications of all the available evidenceThe uL4 mutants identified in this study were significantly more resistant towards macrolide antibiotics than strains harbouring a wild type uL4 hereby revealing that not only are macrolides effective as antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa but also that the imposed selective pressure causes resistant mutants to arise through mutations in the ribosomal uL4 protein. These mutations are also present but uncharacterized in other collections of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from patient groups who typically receive long courses of macrolide treatment. The effect of the uL4 and possibly other hitherto unknown mutations on macrolide susceptibility can be determined via modification of the standard susceptibility testing protocol. Along with evidence describing other types of macrolide resistance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa such as rRNA modification and increased efflux activity, our results demonstrate that macrolide resistance development is widespread in P. aeruginosa and macrolide antibiotics should be considered as antimicrobial agents against P. aeruginosa with the same precautions being taken to avoid resistance development as for any other antimicrobial agent.","Goltermann, L.; Andersen, K.

The extracellular lipase A belongs to the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa. The lipase undergoes folding and activation in the periplasm prior the secretion. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitous periplasmic chaperone Skp of P. aeruginosa, but not SurA, FkpA, PpiD or YfgM, efficiently prevents misfolding of the aggregation-prone lipase A and facilitates its activation by a specific foldase LipH. Small-angle X-ray scattering visualizes the trimeric architecture of P. aeruginosa Skp and identifies two primary conformations of the chaperone, a compact and a widely open. We describe two binding modes of Skp to the lipase, with affinities of 20 nM and 2 M, which correspond to 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometry of the lipase:Skp complex. Two Skp trimers are required to stabilize the lipase via the apolar interactions, which are not affected by high salt concentrations typical for the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. The chaperoning effect of Skp points to its potent role in maturation and secretion of the lipase in Pseudomonas species.","Papadopoulos, A.; Busch, M.; Reiners, J.; Hachani, E.; Baeumers, M.; Schmitt, L.; Jaeger, K.-E.; Kovacic, F.; Smits, S.

Previously, novel antibiotic tolerant variants known as phoenix colonies as well as variants similar to viable but non-culturable (VBNC) colonies were identified in response to high concentrations of aminoglycosides. In this study, the mechanisms behind phoenix colony and VBNC-like colony emergence were further explored using both whole genome sequencing and RNA sequencing. Phoenix colonies were found to have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PA4673 gene, which is predicted to encode a GTP-binding protein. No SNPs were identified within VBNC-like colonies compared to the founder population. RNA sequencing did not detect change in expression of PA4673 but revealed multiple differentially expressed genes that may play a role in phoenix colony emergence. One of these differentially expressed genes, PA3626, encodes for a tRNA pseudouridine synthase which when knocked out led to a complete lack of phoenix colonies. Although not immediately clear whether the identified genes in this study may have interactions which have not yet been recognized, they may contribute to the understanding of how phoenix colonies are able to emerge and survive in the presence of antibiotic exposure.","Sindeldecker, D.; Dunn, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,212357,CRISPR-Cas12a targeting of ssDNA plays no detectable role in immunity,"CRISPR-Cas12a (Cpf1) is a bacterial RNA-guided nuclease that cuts double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at sites specified by a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) guide. Additional activities have been ascribed to this enzyme in vitro: site-specific (cis) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage and indiscriminate (trans) degradation of ssDNA, RNA, and dsDNA after activation by a complementary target. The ability of Cas12a to cleave nucleic acids indiscriminately has been harnessed for many applications, including diagnostics, but it remains unknown if it contributes to bacterial immunity. Here, we provide evidence that cleavage of ssDNA in cis or in trans by Cas12a is insufficient to impact immunity. Using LbCas12a expressed in either Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli, we observed that cleavage of dsDNA targets did not elicit cell death or dormancy, suggesting insignificant levels of collateral damage against host RNA or DNA. Canonical immunity against invasive dsDNA also had no impact on the replicative fitness of co-infecting ssDNA phage or plasmid in trans. Lastly, crRNAs complementary to invasive ssDNA did not provide protection, suggesting that ssDNA cleavage does not occur in vivo or is insignificant. Overall, these results suggest that CRISPR-Cas12a immunity predominantly occurs via canonical targeting of dsDNA, and that the other activities are in vitro irregularities.","Marino, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,212577,Visualization of mRNA Expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aggregates Reveals Spatial Patterns of Fermentative and Denitrifying Metabolism,"Gaining insight into the behavior of bacteria at the single cell level is important given that heterogeneous microenvironments strongly influence microbial physiology. The hybridization chain reaction (HCR) is a technique that provides in situ molecular signal amplification, enabling simultaneous mapping of multiple target RNAs at small spatial scales. To refine this method for biofilm applications, we designed and validated new probes to visualize expression of key catabolic genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggregates. In addition to using existing probes for the dissimilatory nitrate reductase (narG), we developed probes for a terminal oxidase (ccoN1), nitrite reductase (nirS), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and acetate kinase (ackA). These probes can be used to determine gene expression levels both in liquid culture and in biofilms. Using these probes, we quantified gene expression across oxygen gradients in aggregate populations grown using the agar block biofilm assay (ABBA). We observed distinct patterns of catabolic gene expression, with upregulation occurring in particular ABBA regions both within individual aggregates and over the aggregate population. Aerobic respiration (ccoN1) showed peak expression under oxic conditions, whereas fermentation (ackA) showed peak expression in the anoxic cores of high metabolic activity aggregates near the air-agar interface. Denitrification genes narG, nirS, and nosZ showed peak expression in hypoxic and anoxic regions, although nirS expression was much stronger in anoxic environments compared to other denitrification genes. These results reveal that the microenvironment correlates with catabolic gene expression in aggregates, and demonstrate the utility of HCR in unveiling cellular activities at the microscale in heterogeneous populations.

ImportanceTo understand bacteria in diverse contexts we must understand the variations in behaviors and metabolisms they express spatiotemporally. Populations of bacteria are known to be heterogeneous, but the ways this variation manifests can be challenging to characterize due to technical limitations. By focusing on energy conservation, we demonstrate that HCR v3.0 can visualize nuances in gene expression, allowing us to understand how metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms responds to microenvironmental variation at high spatial resolution. We validated probes for four catabolic genes: a constitutively expressed oxidase, acetate kinase, nitrite reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase. We showed that the genes for different modes of metabolism are expressed in overlapping but distinct subpopulations according to oxygen concentrations in a predictable fashion.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,212891,Group II Intron-Like Reverse TranscriptasesFunction in Double-Strand Break Repair by Microhomology-Mediated End Joining,"Bacteria encode free-standing reverse transcriptases (RTs) of unknown function that are closely related to group II intron-encoded RTs. Here, we found that a Pseudomonas aeruginosa group II intron-like RT (G2L4 RT) with YIDD instead of YADD at its active site functions in DNA repair in its native host and when transferred into Escherichia coli. G2L4 RT has biochemical activities strikingly similar to those of human DNA repair polymerase{theta} and uses them for translesion DNA synthesis and double-strand break repair (DSBR) via microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) in vitro and in vivo. We also found that a group II intron RT can function similarly to G2L4 RT in DNA repair, with reciprocal substitutions at the active site showing an I residue favors MMEJ and an A residue favors primer extension in both enzymes. The DNA repair functions of these enzymes utilize conserved structural features of non-LTR-retroelement RTs, including human LINE-1 and other eukaryotic non-LTR-retrotransposon RTs, suggesting such enzymes may have an inherent ability to function in DSBR in a wide range of organisms.","Park, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,212980,Reproducibility problem with a proposed standard method to measure disinfection efficacy,"A collaborative study was carried out in four laboratories to determine the reproducibility of a proposed ASTM International standard method for quantitatively evaluating the efficacy of disinfectants on hard, non-porous surfaces against bacteria. The method, known as the Quantitative Method, has also been suggested as a future regulatory standard for the United States and internationally. The multi-lab study was carried out using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride antimicrobial product diluted in hard water. Results of the study showed acceptable repeatability in log10 reductions within each laboratory, but unacceptable reproducibility across laboratories despite careful analyst training and standardization of test conditions. A follow-up study ruled out analyst-to-analyst differences as the cause of the poor reproducibility. As it currently exists, the Quantitative Method is not sufficiently reproducible. Ruggedness testing to assess the sensitivity of the method to small changes in operational factors is recommended.","Hilgren, J.; Srikanth, M.; Brutofsky, M.; Mainquist, K.; Prew, P.; King, W.; Jones, R.; Hellickson, L.; Luedtke, J.; Restrepo, K.; Brill, F.; Quinn, P.; The Efficacy Working Group,  ",2022-03-15,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.03.15.484496,1,John  Hilgren,Ecolab Research Center,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.15.484496v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.15.484496v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,213255,Surface motility favors co-dependent interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia,"Interactions between different bacterial species shape bacterial communities and their environments. The opportunistic pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia both can colonize the lungs of individuals affected by cystic fibrosis. Using the social surface behavior called swarming motility as a study model of interactions, we noticed intricate interactions between B. cenocepacia K56-2 and P. aeruginosa PA14. While strain K56-2 does not swarm under P. aeruginosa favorable swarming conditions, co-inoculation with a non-motile PA14 flagellum-less {Delta}fliC mutant restored spreading for both strains. We show that P. aeruginosa provides the wetting agent rhamnolipids allowing K56-2 to perform swarming motility, while aflagellated PA14 seems able to <<hitchhike>> along with K56-2 cells in the swarming colony.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia are important opportunistic pathogens often found together in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis. Laboratory co-culture of both species often ends with one taking over the other. We used a surface motility assay to study the social interactions between population of these bacterial species. Under our conditions, B. cenocepacia cannot swarm without supplementation of the wetting agent produced by P. aeruginosa. In a mixed colony of both species, an aflagellated mutant of P. aeruginosa provides the necessary wetting agent to B. cenocepacia, allowing both bacteria to swarm and colonize a surface. We highlight this peculiar interaction where both bacteria set aside their antagonistic tendencies to cooperate.","Morin, C.; Landry, M.; Groleau, M.-C.; Deziel, E.",2022-03-18,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.03.16.484684,1,Eric  Déziel,INRS-Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484684v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.16.484684v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,213562,Development of ONT-cappable-seq to unravel the transcriptional landscape of Pseudomonas phages,"RNA sequencing has become the method of choice to study the transcriptional landscape of phage-infected bacteria. However, short-read RNA sequencing approaches generally fail to capture the primary 5 and 3 boundaries of transcripts, confounding the discovery of key transcription initiation and termination events as well as operon architectures. Yet, the elucidation of these elements is crucial for the understanding of the strategy of transcription regulation during the infection process, which is currently lacking beyond a handful of model phages. To this end, we developed ONT-cappable-seq, a specialized long-read RNA sequencing technique that allows end-to-end sequencing of primary prokaryotic transcripts using the Nanopore sequencing platform. We applied ONT-cappable-seq to study transcription of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ7, obtaining a comprehensive genome-wide map of viral transcription start sites, terminators, and complex operon structures that fine-regulate gene expression. Our work provides new insights in the RNA biology of a non-model phage, unveiling distinct promoter architectures, putative small non-coding viral RNAs, and the prominent regulatory role of terminators during infection. The robust workflow presented here offers a framework to obtain a global, yet fine-grained view of phage transcription and paves the way for standardized, in depth transcription studies for microbial viruses or bacteria in general.","Putzeys, L.; Boon, M.; Lammens, E.-M.; Kuznedelov, K.; Severinov, K.; Lavigne, R.",2022-03-19,Genomics,10.1101/2022.03.18.484859,1,Rob  Lavigne,KU Leuven,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484859v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484859v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.csbj.2022.05.034
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,214081,The lectin LecB induces patches with basolateral characteristics at the apical membrane to promote Pseudomonas aeruginosa host cell invasion,"The opportunistic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can infect mucosal tissues of the human body. To persist at the mucosal barrier, this highly adaptable pathogen has evolved many strategies, including invasion of host cells. Here, we show that the P. aeruginosa lectin LecB binds and cross-links fucosylated receptors at the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. This triggers a signaling cascade via Src kinases and PI3K leading to the formation of patches enriched with the basolateral marker PIP3 at the apical plasma membrane. This identifies LecB as causative bacterial factor for activating this well-known host cell response that is elicited upon apical binding of P. aeruginosa. Downstream of PI3K, Rac1 is activated to cause actin rearrangement and the outgrowth of protrusions at the apical plasma membrane. LecB-triggered PI3K activation also results in aberrant recruitment of caveolin-1 to the apical domain. In addition, we reveal a positive feedback loop between PI3K activation and apical caveolin-1 recruitment, which provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed implication of caveolin-1 in P. aeruginosa host cell invasion. Interestingly, LecB treatment also reversibly removes primary cilia. To directly prove the role of LecB for bacterial uptake, we coated bacteria-sized beads with LecB, which drastically enhanced their endocytosis. Furthermore, LecB deletion and LecB inhibition with L-fucose diminished the invasion efficiency of P. aeruginosa bacteria. Taken together, our study identifies LecB as missing link that can explain how PI3K signaling and caveolin-1 recruitment are triggered to facilitate invasion of epithelial cells from the apical side by P. aeruginosa.

ImportanceAn intriguing feature of the bacterium P. aeruginosa is its ability to colonize highly diverse niches. P. aeruginosa can, besides biofilm formation, also enter and proliferate within epithelial host cells. Moreover, research during recent years has shown that P. aeruginosa possesses many different mechanisms to invade host cells. In this study we identify LecB as novel invasion factor. In particular, we show that LecB activates PI3K signaling, which is connected via a positive feedback loop to apical caveolin-1 recruitment, and leads to actin rearrangement at the apical plasma membrane. This provides a unifying explanation for the previously reported implication of PI3K and caveolin-1 in P. aeruginosa host cell invasion. In addition, our study adds a further function to the remarkable repertoire of the lectin LecB, which is all brought about by the capability of LecB to recognize fucosylated glycans on many different niche-specific host cell receptors.","Thuenauer, R.; Kühn, K.; Guo, Y.; Kotsis, F.; Xu, M.; Trefzer, A.; Altmann, S.; Wehrum, S.; Heshmatpour, N.; Faust, B.; Landi, A.; Diedrich, B.; Dengjel, J.; Kuehn, W.; Imberty, A.; Römer, W.",2022-03-25,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.03.23.485577,1,Winfried  Römer,"Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.485577v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.23.485577v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/mbio.00819-22
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,214050,Volatile hydrogen cyanide released by Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides a competitive advantage over Staphylococcus aureus in biofilm and in vivo lung environments,"Diverse bacterial volatile compounds alter bacterial stress responses and physiology, but their contribution to population dynamics in polymicrobial communities is not well known. In this study, we showed that airborne volatile hydrogen cyanide (HCN) produced by a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains leads to at-a-distance inhibition of the growth of a wide array of Staphylococcus aureus strains. We determined that low oxygen level environments not only enhance P. aeruginosa HCN production but also increase S. aureus sensitivity to HCN, which impacts P. aeruginosa-S. aureus competition in microaerobic in vitro mixed biofilms as well as in an in vitro cystic fibrosis lung sputum medium. Consistently, we demonstrated that production of HCN provides a competitive advantage to P. aeruginosa in a mouse model of airways co-infected by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Our study therefore demonstrates that P. aeruginosa HCN contributes to local and distant airborne competition against S. aureus and potentially other HCN-sensitive bacteria in contexts relevant to cystic fibrosis and other polymicrobial infectious diseases.

IMPORTANCEAirborne volatile compounds produced by bacteria are often only considered as attractive or repulsive scents, but they also directly contribute to bacterial physiology. Here we showed that volatile hydrogen cyanide (HCN) released by a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains inhibits Staphylococcus aureus growth in low oxygen in vitro biofilms or aggregates and in vivo lung environments. These results are of pathophysiological relevance, since lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are known to present microaerophilic areas and to be commonly associated with the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in polymicrobial communities. Our study therefore provides insights into how a bacterial volatile compound can contribute to the exclusion of S. aureus and other HCN-sensitive competitors from P. aeruginosa ecological niches. It opens new perspectives for the management or monitoring of P. aeruginosa infections in lower lung airway infections and other polymicrobial disease contexts.","Letoffe, S.; Wu, Y.; Darch, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,214154,Effects of mucin and DNA concentrations in airway mucus on Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm recalcitrance,"The pathological properties of airway mucus in cystic fibrosis (CF) are dictated by mucus concentration and composition, with mucins and DNA being responsible for mucus viscoelastic properties. As CF pulmonary disease progresses, the concentrations of mucins and DNA increase and are associated with increased mucus viscoelasticity and decreased transport. Similarly, the biophysical properties of bacterial biofilms are heavily influenced by the composition of their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). While the roles of polymer concentration and composition in mucus and biofilm mechanical properties have been evaluated independently, the relationship between mucus concentration and composition and the biophysical properties of biofilms grown therein remains unknown. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown in airway mucus as a function of overall concentration and DNA concentration to mimic healthy and CF physiology and biophysical properties were evaluated with macro- and microrheology. Biofilms were also characterized after exposure to DNase or DTT to examine the effects of DNA and mucin degradation, respectively. Identifying critical targets in biofilms for disrupting mechanical stability in highly concentrated mucus may lead to the development of efficacious biofilm therapies and ultimately improve CF patient outcomes. Overall mucus concentration was the predominant contributor to biofilm viscoelasticity and both DNA degradation and mucin reduction resulted in compromised biofilm mechanical strength.","Rouillard, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,214141,The effects of antibiotic combination treatments on Pseudomonas aeruginosa tolerance evolution and coexistence with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterium is a common pathogen of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients due to its ability to evolve resistance to antibiotics during treatments. While P. aeruginosa resistance evolution is well characterised in monocultures, it is less well understood in polymicrobial CF infections. Here, we investigated how exposure to ciprofloxacin, colistin, or tobramycin antibiotics, administered at sub-MIC doses alone and in combination, shaped the tolerance evolution of P. aeruginosa (PAO1 lab and clinical CF LESB58 strains) in the absence and presence of a commonly co-occurring species, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Increases in antibiotic tolerances were primarily driven by the presence of that antibiotic in the treatment. We observed a reciprocal cross-tolerance between ciprofloxacin and tobramycin, and when combined these antibiotics selected increased MICs for all antibiotics. Though the presence of S. maltophilia did not affect the tolerance or the MIC evolution, it drove P. aeruginosa into extinction more frequently in the presence of tobramycin due to its relatively greater innate tobramycin tolerance. In contrast, P. aeruginosa dominated and drove S. maltophilia extinct in most other treatments. Together, our findings suggest that besides driving high-level antibiotic tolerance evolution, sub-MIC antibiotic exposure can alter competitive bacterial interactions, leading to target pathogen extinctions in multi-species communities.","Law, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,214819,Bacteriophages antagonize cGAS-like immunity in bacteria,"The recently discovered cyclic-oligonucleotide-based anti-phage signaling system (CBASS) is related to eukaryotic cGAS-STING anti-viral immunity and is present in diverse prokaryotes. However, our understanding of how CBASS detects, inhibits, and co-evolves with phages is limited because CBASS function has only been studied in reconstituted heterologous systems. Here, we identify a phage-encoded CBASS antagonist (acbIIA1, anti-cbass type II-A gene 1) necessary for phage replication in the presence of endogenous CBASS immunity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. acbIIA1 homologs are encoded by numerous lytic and temperate phages infecting Gram-negative bacteria. Deletion of acbIIA1 renders multiple phages susceptible to CBASS, but phages can then escape immune function via mutations in the major capsid gene. These mutants suggest that CBASS is activated by, or targets, the late-expressed phage capsid. Together, we establish a native model system to study CBASS and identify a common phage-encoded CBASS antagonist, demonstrating that CBASS is a bona fide anti-phage immune system in nature.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215170,Bacterial threat assessment of bacteriophage infection is mediated by intracellular polyamine accumulation and Gac/Rsm signaling,"When eukaryotic cells are killed by pathogenic microorganisms, damage-associated and pathogen-associated signals are generated that alert other cells of nearby danger. Bacteria can detect the death of their kin; however, how bacteria make threat assessments of cellular injury is largely unexplored. Here we show that polyamines released by lysed bacteria serve as damage-associated molecules in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In response to exogenous polyamines, Gac/Rsm and cyclic-di-GMP signaling is activated and intracellular polyamine levels increase. In the absence of a threat, polyamines are catabolized, and intracellular polyamines return to basal levels, but cells infected by bacteriophage increase and maintain intracellular polyamine levels, which inhibits phage replication. Phage species not inhibited by polyamines did not trigger polyamine accumulation by P. aeruginosa, suggesting polyamine accumulation and metabolism are targets in the phage-host arms-race. Our results suggest that like eukaryotic cells, bacteria can differentiate damage-associated and pathogen-associated signals to make threat assessments of cellular injury.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215570,Advanced transcriptomic analysis reveals the role of efflux pumps and media composition in antibiotic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and major cause of hospital acquired infections. The pathogenicity and virulence of P. aeruginosa is largely determined by its transcriptional regulatory network (TRN). We used 411 transcription profiles of P. aeruginosa from diverse growth conditions to construct a quantitative TRN by identifying independently modulated sets of genes (called iModulons) and their condition-specific activity levels. The current study focused on the use of iModulons to analyze pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa. Our analysis revealed: 1) 116 iModulons, 81 of which show strong association with known regulators; 2) novel roles of two-component systems in regulating antibiotics efflux pumps; 3) substrate-efflux pump associations; 4) differential iModulon activity in response to beta-lactam antibiotics in bacteriological and physiological media; 5) differential activation of  Cell Division iModulon resulting from exposure to different beta-lactam antibiotics; and 6) a role of the PprB iModulon in the stress-induced transition from planktonic to biofilm lifestyle. In light of these results, the construction of an iModulon-based TRN provides a transcriptional regulatory basis for key aspects of P. aeruginosa infection, such as antibiotic stress responses and biofilm formation. Taken together, our results offer a novel mechanistic understanding of P. aeruginosa pathogenicity.

SignificanceLarge data sets and machine learning are impacting a growing number of areas of research in the life sciences. Once the compendia of bacterial transcriptomes reached a critical size, we could use source signal extraction algorithms to find lists of co-regulated genes (called iModulons) associated with a transcription factor (TF) to them. The gene composition of iModulons and their condition-dependent activity levels constitute a quantitative description of the composition of bacterial transcriptomes. This study shows how this approach can be used to reveal the responses of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics and thus yield a deep regulatory understanding of pathogenicity properties. This study motivates the execution of similar studies for the other ESKAPEEs to yield a broad understanding of the role of TRNs in antibiotic responses to these urgent threat bacterial pathogens.","Rajput, A.; Tsunemoto, H.; Sastry, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215585,Evidence for complex interplay between quorum sensing and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a cell-density-dependent, intercellular communication system mediated by small diffusible signaling molecules. QS regulates a range of bacterial behaviors, including biofilm formation, virulence, drug resistance mechanisms, and antibiotic tolerance. Enzymes capable of degrading signaling molecules can interfere in QS - a process termed quorum quenching (QQ). Remarkably, previous work reported some cases where enzymatic interference in QS was synergistic to antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The premise of combination therapy is attractive to fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria, yet comprehensive studies are lacking. Here we evaluate the effects of QS signal disruption on the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa by testing 222 antibiotics and antibacterial compounds from 15 different classes. We found compelling evidence that QS signal disruption does indeed affect antibiotic resistance (40% of all tested compounds; 89/222), albeit not always synergistically (not synergistic for 48% of compounds with an effect (43/89)). For some tested antibiotics, like sulfathiazole and trimethoprim, we were able to relate the changes in resistance caused by QS signal disruption to the modulation of the expression of key genes of the folate biosynthetic pathway. Moreover, using a P. aeruginosa-based Caenorhabditis elegans killing model, we confirm that enzymatic QQ modulates the effects of antibiotics on P. aeruginosas pathogenicity in vivo. Altogether, these results show that signal disruption has profound and complex effects on the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa. This work suggests that combination therapy including QQ and antibiotics should not be discussed globally but rather in case-by-case studies.

IMPORTANCEInterference in bacterial Quorum Sensing (QS) is a promising approach to control microbial behavior. Of particular interest is the potential of this strategy to reduce biofilms and virulence of antibiotic resistant strains. Interestingly, several studies report synergistic interactions between antibiotic treatments and interference in QS. However, it is unclear whether this is a generality, let alone the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed synergies. Here, we provide a comprehensive description of combination treatment in the model organism, opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa. Screening > 200 antimicrobials, and combining them to QS signals and disruption strategies, we show that there is no systematic synergy between these approaches in vitro, as well as in vivo, in a C. elegans infection model. Altogether, this work show that QS has complex connections to the antibiotic resistance profile of P. aeruginosa, and that combination treatment should not be discussed globally, but rather in case-by-case studies.","Sikdar, R.; Elias, M.",2022-04-06,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.04.05.487235,1,Mikael  Elias,University of Minnesota,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.05.487235v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.05.487235v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215601,"The {varphi}PA3 Phage Nucleus is Enclosed by a Self-Assembling, 2D Crystalline Lattice","A growing number of jumbo bacteriophages, with genomes exceeding 200 kb, have been found to establish a Phage Nucleus--a micron-scale, proteinaceous structure encompassing the replicating phage DNA. Bacteriophage and host proteins associated with replication and transcription are concentrated inside the Phage Nucleus while nucleotide synthesis, translation, and numerous other host and exogenous proteins are effectively excluded, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction endonuclease host defense systems. Here, we show that fragments of the Phage Nucleus isolated from {phi}PA3 infected Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells form a square lattice and demonstrate that the recombinantly purified primary Phage Nuclear Enclosure (PhuN) protein spontaneously assembles into sheets also constructed from a square lattice which we resolve to 3.8 [A] by cryo-EM. Our structure reveals that the flexible termini and large loops mediate adaptable inter-tetramer contacts that drive shell assembly into a C2-symmetric lattice.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215976,"Assessing the importance of resistance, persistence and hyper-mutation for antibiotic treatment success with stochastic modelling","Antimicrobial resistance poses a rising threat to global health, making it crucial to understand the routes of bacterial survival during antimicrobial treatments. Treatment failure can result from genetic or phenotypic mechanisms, which diminish the effect of antibiotics. By assembling empirical data, we find that, for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis patients frequently contain persisters, transiently non-growing and antibiotic-refractory subpopulations, and hyper-mutators, mutants with elevated mutation rates and thus higher probability of genetic resistance emergence. Resistance, persistence and hyper-mutation dynamics are difficult to disentangle experimentally. Hence, we use stochastic population modelling and deterministic fitness calculations of bacterial evolution under antibiotic treatment to investigate how genetic resistance and phenotypic mechanisms affect treatment success. We find that treatment failure is caused by resistant mutants at lower antibiotic concentrations (with high final bacterial numbers), but by persistence phenotypes at higher antibiotic concentrations (with low final bacterial numbers). Facilitation of resistance occurs through hyper-mutators during treatment, but through persistence only after treatment is discontinued, which allows for persisters to resume growth and evolve resistance in the absence of antibiotics. Our findings highlight the time- and concentration-dependence of different bacterial mechanisms to escape antibiotic killing, which should be considered when designing  resistance-proof antimicrobial treatments.","Witzany, C.; Regoes, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,215721,Neutrophil IL-1β secretion induced by ExoS expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa is dependent on NLRP3 and Gasdermin D,"Macrophages infected with Gram-negative bacteria expressing flagellin or Type III secretion system (T3SS) structural proteins are known to activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, resulting in caspase-1 and Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage, IL-1{beta} secretion and pyroptotic cell death. We examined the role of these mediators in IL-1{beta} secretion by neutrophils infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 that expresses the Type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors ExoS and ExoT. We found that IL-1{beta} secretion by neutrophils was dependent on expression of the T3SS needle and translocon proteins. Although pro-GSDMD and pro-GSDME were processed in PAO1 infected neutrophils, only GSDMD was required for IL-1{beta} secretion. PAO1 - induced IL-1{beta} secretion by macrophages was NLRC4 dependent, IL-1{beta} secretion by neutrophils utilized NLRC4 only in the absence of P. aeruginosa exoenzymes. Instead, PAO1 - induced IL-1{beta} secretion required NLRP3, which mediated by ExoS ADP ribosyl transferase activity. Overall, these findings reveal fundamental differences between neutrophils and macrophages in IL-1{beta} secretion in response to pathogenic bacteria.","Minns, M.; Lima, T.; Liboro, K.; Abbondante, S.; Marshall, M.; Rietsch, A.; Dubyak, G.; Pearlman, E.",2022-04-07,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.04.07.487503,1,Eric  Pearlman,"University of California, Irvine",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.07.487503v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.07.487503v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216213,Core and accessory effectors of type VI secretion systems contribute differently to the intraspecific diversity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria use type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) to deliver effector proteins into other cells or the extracellular space. Those effectors kill microbes1, manipulate eukaryotic cells2, and sequester nutrients3. Which T6SS-mediated functions are generalisable across bacteria of a species or are specific to particular strains is little known. Here, we use genomics to test for the intraspecific diversity of T6SS effectors in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found effectors that are omnipresent and conserved across strains acting as  core effectors, while additional  accessory effectors vary. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate different roles of the two types of effectors in bacterial killing and virulence. Further, effectors compose various effector combinations. Within one local population of clinical isolates, we observed 36 combinations among 52 bacterial lineages. These findings show the distinct contribution of T6SS effectors to strain-level variation of a bacterial pathogen and might reveal conserved targets for novel antibiotics.","Habich, A.; Galeev, A.; Chaves Vargas, V.; Vogler, O.; Ghoul, M.; Andersen, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216692,Architecture of the biofilm-associated archaic CupE pilus from Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Chaperone-Usher Pathway (CUP) pili are major adhesins in Gram-negative bacteria, mediating bacterial adherence to biotic and abiotic surfaces. While classical CUP pili have been extensively characterized, little is known about so-called archaic CUP pili, which are phylogenetically widespread and promote biofilm formation by several human pathogens. In this study, we present the electron cryomicroscopy structure of the archaic CupE pilus from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that CupE pili consist of CupE1 subunits arranged in a zigzag architecture, with an N-terminal donor {beta}-strand extending from each subunit into the next, where it is anchored by hydrophobic interactions, resulting in an overall flexible pilus arrangement. Imaging CupE pili on the surface of P. aeruginosa cells using electron cryotomography shows that CupE pili adopt variable curvatures in response to their environment, which may facilitate their role in promoting cohesion between bacterial cells. Finally, bioinformatic analysis shows the widespread abundance of cupE genes in isolates of P. aeruginosa and the co-occurrence of cupE with other cup clusters, suggesting interdependence of cup pili in regulating bacterial adherence within biofilms. Taken together, our study provides insights into the architecture of archaic CUP pili and their role in promoting cellular adhesion and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa.","Boehning, J.; Dobbelstein, A.; Sulkowski, N.; Eilers, K.; Von Kugelgen, A.; Tarafder, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216802,Compendium-wide analysis of P. aeruginosa core and accessory genes reveal more nuanced transcriptional patterns,"Strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes difficult to treat infections, have significant genomic heterogeneity including the presence of diverse accessory genes that are only present in some strains or clades. Both core genes, which are conserved across strains, and accessory genes have been associated with traits such as biofilm formation and virulence. Much of what we know about core and accessory gene content comes from genome analyses. Here, we use a newly assembled transcriptome compendium to analyze the transcriptional patterns of core and accessory gene expression in PAO1 and PA14 strains across thousands of samples from hundreds of distinct experiments. We found that a subset of core genes were stable, having consistent correlated expression patterns across samples regardless of strain background, with a focus on strains PAO1 and PA14. These stable core genes had fewer co-expressed neighbors that were accessory genes.

SignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous pathogen. There is a lot of diversity amongst P. aeruginosa strains, some which are clinically relevant. Understanding how these different strain-level traits manifest is important for identifying targets that regulate different traits of interest. With the availability of a PAO1-mapped and PA14-mapped RNA-seq compendium, which contain hundreds of strains, it is now possible to examine the effect of different strains on expression, which can mediate different traits. In this study we developed an approach to compare expression profiles across different P. aeruginosa gene groups - core and accessory genes. This approach revealed a subset of core genes with different transcriptional patterns across strains, which could contribute to trait differences.","Lee, A. J.; Doing, G.; Neff, S. L.; Reiter, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216863,CbpD crystal structure adds intrigue to substrate-specificity motifs in chitin-active lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes diverse proteins via its Type 2 Secretion System, including a 39 KDa Chitin-Binding Protein, CbpD. CbpD was recently shown to be a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase active on chitin, and to contribute substantially to virulence. To-date no structure of this virulence factor has been reported. Its first two domains are homologous to those found in the crystal structure of Vibrio cholerae GbpA, while the third domain is homologous to the NMR structure of the Cellvibrio japonicus CjLPMO10A CBM73 domain. We report the 3.0 [A] resolution crystal structure of CbpD solved by molecular replacement, which required ab initio models of each CbpD domain generated by the artificial intelligence deep learning structure prediction algorithm RoseTTAFold. The structure of CbpD confirms previously postulated chitin-specific motifs in the AA10 domain while challenging the deterministic effects of other postulated substrate specificity motifs. Additionally, the structure of CbpD shows that post translational modifications occur on the chitin binding surface. Moreover, the structure raises interesting possibilities about how Type 2 Secretion System substrates may interact with the secretion machinery and demonstrates the utility of new artificial intelligence protein structure prediction algorithms in making challenging structural targets tractable.","Dade, C.; Douzi, B.; Cambillau, C.; Ball, G.; Voulhoux, R.; Forest, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216908,Peptidergic signaling controls the dynamics of sickness behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans,"Pathogenic infection elicits sickness behaviors that promote recovery and survival of the host. For example, following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans modifies its sensory preferences to avoid the pathogen. Here we identify antagonistic neuromodulatory circuits that shape this sickness behavior. Using an unbiased cell-directed neuropeptide screen, we show that AVK neurons upregulate and release FMRFamide-like FLP-1 neuropeptides during infection to drive pathogen avoidance. Manipulations that increase or decrease AVK signaling accelerate or delay pathogen avoidance, respectively, implicating AVK in the dynamics of sickness behavior. FLP-1 neuropeptides act via the G-protein-coupled receptor DMSR-7 in RIM/RIC neurons to reduce tyraminergic/octopaminergic signaling that opposes pathogen avoidance. RIM/RIC neurons relay parallel signals from neuropeptides and the cytokine TGF-{beta} that represent internal and external regulators of pathogen avoidance. Our results demonstrate that antagonism between neuromodulatory systems results in slow, graded transitions between alternative behavioral states.","Marquina-Solis, J.; Vandewyver, E.; Hawk, J.; Colon-Ramos, D.; Beets, I.; Bargmann, C.",2022-04-17,Neuroscience,10.1101/2022.04.16.488560,1,Cori  Bargmann,Rockefeller University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.16.488560v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.16.488560v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,216976,Pyochelin biotransformation shapes bacterial competition,"It has become evident that numerous infections are polymicrobial and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are among the most frequently isolated co-infecting bacterial species. We applied mass spectrometry guided interaction studies to determine how chemical interaction shapes the fitness and community structure during co-infection of these two pathogens. We demonstrate that S. aureus is equipped with an elegant mechanism, inactivation of pyochelin via the yet uncharacterized methyltransferase Spm (staphylococcal pyochelin methyltransferase), to increase its survival during in vivo competition with P. aeruginosa. Methylation of pyochelin abolishes the siderophore activity of pyochelin and significantly lowers pyochelin-mediated intracellular ROS production in S. aureus. In a murine wound co-infection model, a S. aureus mutant unable to metyhlate pyochelin shows significant lower fitness compared to its parental strain.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217030,An rRNA fragment in extracellular vesicles secreted by human airway epithelial cells increases the fluoroquinolone sensitivity of P. aeruginosa,"Lung infection by antibiotic resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-known concern for immunocompromised hosts including people with lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis. We have previously demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by primary human airway epithelial cells (AEC) deliver miRNA let-7b-5p to P. aeruginosa where it suppresses biofilm formation and increases sensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. In this study we used RNA-seq to characterize the small RNA (sRNA) content of EVs secreted by AEC and demonstrate transfer of multiple distinct RNA fragments from EVs to P. aeruginosa. Bioinformatic predictions reveal that several sRNAs may target all three subunits of the fluoroquinolone efflux pump MexHI-OpmD, an effect predicted to increase antibiotic sensitivity to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. Exposure of P. aeruginosa to EVs resulted in a significant reduction in the protein levels of MexH (-48%), MexI (-50%) and OpmD (-35%). Moreover, EVs reduced planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin by 20%. A mexGHI-opmD deletion mutant of P. aeruginosa phenocopied this increased sensitivity to ciprofloxacin. Finally, we found that a fragment of an 18S rRNA external transcribed spacer that was transferred to P. aeruginosa by EVs was sufficient to reduce planktonic growth of P. aeruginosa in the presence of ciprofloxacin, to reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of P. aeruginosa for ciprofloxacin by over 50%, and to significantly reduce protein levels of MexH and OpmD. In conclusion, an rRNA fragment secreted by AEC in EVs increases the ciprofloxacin sensitivity of P. aeruginosa by targeting and down-regulating the fluoroquinolone efflux pump MexHI-OpmD. A combination of rRNA fragments and ciprofloxacin packaged in nanoparticles or EVs may benefit patients with antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa infections.

Author SummaryAccording to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are a significant global threat to human health. Thus, development of new approaches to eliminate antibiotic resistant infections is required. In this study, we report that lung epithelial cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that fuse with and deliver small rRNAs to P. aeruginosa, and that the rRNAs increase the sensitivity of P. aeruginosa to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin by reducing protein levels of the drug efflux pump MexHI-OpmD. We identified one rRNA fragment that by itself significantly reduced the protein levels of MexH and OpmD and increased the ability of ciprofloxacin to kill P. aeruginosa. We propose that developing synthetic vesicles containing a combination of the rRNA that inhibits antibiotic efflux pumps and ciprofloxacin would benefit patients with antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa infections.","Koeppen, K.; Hampton, T.; Gerber, S.; Goo, Y.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217284,The PqsE active site as a target for small molecule antimicrobial agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes antibiotic resistant, nosocomial infections in immuno-compromised individuals, and is a high priority for antimicrobial development. Key to pathogenicity in P. aeruginosa are biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Both traits are controlled by the cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS). QS involves the synthesis, release, and population-wide detection of signal molecules called autoinducers. We previously reported that activity of the RhlR QS transcription factor depends on a protein-protein interaction with the hydrolase, PqsE, and PqsE catalytic activity is dispensable for this interaction. Nonetheless, the PqsE-RhlR interaction could be disrupted by substitution of an active site glutamate residue with tryptophan (PqsE(E182W)). Here, we show that disruption of the PqsE-RhlR interaction via either the E182W change or alteration of PqsE surface residues that are essential for the interaction with RhlR, attenuates P. aeruginosa infection in a murine host. We use crystallography to characterize the conformational changes induced by the PqsE(E182W) substitution to define the mechanism underlying disruption of the PqsE-RhlR interaction. A loop rearrangement that repositions the E280 residue in PqsE(E182W) is responsible for the loss of interaction. We verify the implications garnered from the PqsE(E182W) structure using mutagenic, biochemical, and additional structural analyses. We present the next generation of molecules targeting the PqsE active site, including a structure of the tightest binding of these compounds, BB584, in complex with PqsE. The findings presented here provide insight for drug discovery against P. aeruginosa with PqsE as the target.

Author SummaryThe human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is resistant to many currently used antibiotics, making it a burden of urgent clinical importance. P. aeruginosa pathogenicity is controlled by the bacterial cell-to-cell communication process called quorum sensing (QS). The function of one protein that controls P. aeruginosa QS-directed virulence, RhlR, requires a protein-protein interaction with an enzyme called PqsE. When PqsE is blocked from interacting with RhlR, P. aeruginosa is avirulent and incapable of infecting an animal host. Here, we validate the PqsE-RhlR interaction as a target for antibiotic development, and we present a mechanism for how such antibiotics could disrupt the PqsE-RhlR interaction. Discovery of new antibiotics would fulfill an unmet healthcare need by providing treatments to combat P. aeruginosa infections.","Taylor, I. R.; Jeffrey, P. D.; Moustafa, D. A.; Goldberg, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217369,Dissection of a sensorimotor circuit that regulates aversion to odors and pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans by whole-brain simulation,"Altering behavior to reduce pathogen exposure is a key line of defense against pathogen attack for nearly all animals. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans bacterial infection models have allowed for many insights into the molecular mechanisms of behavioral immunity. However, the neural circuitry between chemosensory neurons that sense pathogenic bacterial cues and the motor neurons responsible for avoidance-associated locomotion remains unknown. We found that backward locomotion was a component of learned pathogen avoidance, as animals pre-exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterococcus faecalis showed reflexive aversion to drops of the bacteria, requiring ASI, AWB, and AWC neurons and ASE, AWB, and AWC neurons, respectively. This response also involved intestinal distention and, for E. faecalis, required expression of TRPM channels in the intestine and excretory system. Using whole-brain simulation and functional assays, we uncovered a sensorimotor circuit governing learned reflexive aversion. This behavior is controlled by a four-layer neural circuit composed of olfactory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that control backward locomotion crucial for learned reflexive aversion to pathogenic bacteria, learned avoidance, and a repulsive odor. The discovery of a complete sensorimotor circuit for reflexive aversion demonstrates the utility of using the C. elegans connectome and computational modeling in uncovering new neuronal regulators of behavior.","Filipowicz, A.; Lalsiamthara, J.; Aballay, A.",2022-04-22,Neuroscience,10.1101/2022.04.21.489073,1,Alejandro  Aballay,Oregon Health & Science Univeristy,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.489073v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.21.489073v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217576,Phylogroup-specific variation shapes pangenome dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human opportunistic pathogen consisting of three phylogroups (hereafter named A, B, and C) of unevenly distributed size. Here, we assessed phylogroup-specific evolutionary dynamics in a collection of publicly available and newly sequenced genomes of P. aeruginosa. We explored to what extent antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, defence systems, and virulence genes vary in their distribution across regions of genome plasticity (RGPs) and ""masked"" (RGP-free) genomes, and to what extent this variation differs among the phylogroups. We found that members of phylogroup B possess larger genomes, contribute a comparatively larger number of gene families to the pangenome, but show lower abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems. Furthermore, AMR and defence systems are pervasive in RGPs and integrative and conjugative/mobilizable elements (ICEs/IMEs) from phylogroups A and B, and the abundance of these two types of cargo genes is often significantly correlated. Moreover, multiple inter- and intra-phylogroup interaction events occur at the accessory genome content level, suggesting that recombination events are frequent. Finally, we provide here a panel of phylogenetically diverse P. aeruginosa strains that can be used as a reference set for future functional analyses. Altogether, our results highlight distinct pangenome characteristics of the three phylogroups of P. aeruginosa, that are possibly influenced by variation in the abundance of CRISPR-Cas systems and that are shaped by the differential distribution of AMR and other defence systems.","Botelho, J.; Tüffers, L.; Fuss, J.; Buchholz, F.; Utpatel, C.; Klockgether, J.; Niemann, S.; Tümmler, B.; Schulenburg, H.",2022-04-24,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.04.24.489302,1,João  Botelho,"Antibiotic resistance group, Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology, Ploen, Germany; Evolutionary Ecology and Genetics, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.24.489302v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.24.489302v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217798,Secondary metabolites produced during Aspergillus fumigatus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation,"In Cystic Fibrosis (CF), mucus plaques are formed in the patients lung, creating a hypoxic condition and a propitious environment for colonization and persistence of many microorganisms. There is clinical evidence showing that Aspergillus fumigatus can co-colonize CF patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has been associated with lung function decline. P. aeruginosa produces several compounds with inhibitory and anti-biofilm effects against A. fumigatus in vitro; however, little is known about the fungal compounds produced in counterattack. Here, we annotated fungal and bacterial secondary metabolites (SM) produced in mixed biofilms in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. We detected nine SMs produced by P. aeruginosa. Phenazines and different analogs of pyoverdin were the main compounds produced by P. aeruginosa, and their secretion were increased by the fungal presence. The roles of the two operons responsible for phenazines production (phzA1 and phzA2) were also investigated showing both mutants are able to produce partial sets of phenazines. We detected a total of 20 SMs secreted by A. fumigatus either in monoculture or in co-culture with P. aeruginosa. All these compounds are secreted during biofilm formation either in normoxia or hypoxia. However, only eight compounds (demethoxyfumitremorgin C, fumitremorgin, ferrichrome, ferricrocin, tricetylfusigen, gliotoxin, gliotoxin E, and pyripyropene A) were detected during the biofilm formation by the co-culture of A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa upon both normoxia and hypoxia conditions. Overall, we showed how diverse is SM secretion during A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa mixed culture and how this can affect biofilm formation both in normoxia and hypoxia.

Author SummaryThe interaction between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aspergillus fumigatus has been well-characterized in vitro. In this scenario, the bacterium exerts a strong inhibitory effect against the fungus. However, little is known about the metabolites produced by the fungus to counterattack the bacteria. Our work aimed to annotate secondary metabolites (SM) secreted during co-culture between P. aeruginosa and A. fumigatus during biofilm formation in both normoxia and hypoxia. The bacterium produces several different types of phenazines and pyoverdins, in response to the fungus presence. In contrast, we were able to annotate 29 metabolites produced during A. fumigatus biofilm formation but only eight compounds were detected during biofilm formation by the co-culture of A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa upon both normoxia and hypoxia. In conclusion, we have detected many SMs secreted during A. fumigatus and P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. This analysis can provide several opportunities to understand the interaction between these two species.","Bastos, R.; Akiyama, D.; Dos Reis, T. F.; Colabardini, A. C.; Luperini, R. S.; De Castro, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,217758,Pseudomonas aeruginosa Elicits Sustained IL-1β Upregulation in Alveolar Macrophages from Lung Transplant Recipients,"BackgroundIsolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA) is associated with increased BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) inflammation and lung allograft injury in lung transplant recipients (LTR). However, the effect of PsA on macrophage responses in this population is incompletely understood. We examined human alveolar macrophage (AM) responses to PsA and Pseudomonas dominant microbiome in healthy lung transplant recipients (LTR).

MethodsWe stimulated THP-1 derived macrophages (THP-1M) and human AM from LTR with different bacteria and LTR BAL derived microbiome characterized as Pseudomonas-dominant. Macrophage responses were assessed by high dimensional flow cytometry, including their intracellular production of cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta}, IL-10, IL-1RA, and TGF-{beta}). Pharmacological inhibitors were utilized to evaluate the role of the inflammasome in PsA-macrophages interaction.

ResultsWe observed upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta}) following stimulation by PsA compared to other bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus pneumoniae) in both THP-1 derived and LTR AM, predominated by IL-1{beta}. IL-1{beta} production from THP-1 was sustained after PsA stimulation for up to 96 hours and 48 hours in LTR AM. Treatment with the inflammasome inhibitor BAY11-7082 abrogated macrophage IL-1{beta} and IL-18 production after PsA exposure. BAL Pseudomonas-dominant microbiota elicited an increased IL-1{beta}, similar to PsA, an effect abrogated by the addition of antibiotics.

ConclusionPsA and PsA-dominant lung microbiota induce sustained IL-1{beta} production in LTR AM.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218082,Evolution of the quorum sensing systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa can involve both loss of regulon function and network modulation,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations evolving in cystic fibrosis (CF) lungs, animal infection models, natural environments or in vitro undergo extensive genetic adaption and diversification. A common mutational target is the quorum sensing (QS) regulon, a three-unit regulatory system that controls the expression of a suite of virulence factors and secreted public goods. Three scenarios have been advocated to explain selection for QS mutants, which include (I) disuse of the regulon, (II) cheating on public goods, or (III) modulation of the network. Here, we test these scenarios by examining a set of 61 QS mutants from an experimental evolution study. We observed non-synonymous mutations in all three QS systems - Las, Rhl and PQS. Most Las mutants carried large deletions, resulting in loss of QS function, and the inability to produce QS-regulated traits (scenario I or II). Conversely, phenotypic and gene expression analyses of Rhl mutants support network modulation (scenario III), as these mutants overexpressed the Las and Rhl regulators and showed an altered QS-regulated trait production portfolio. PQS mutants also showed patterns of network modulation (scenario III), spurring strain diversification and phenotypic trade-offs, where the upregulation of certain QS traits is associated with the downregulation of others. Overall, our results indicate that mutations in different QS systems lead to diverging effects on the social portfolio of bacterial populations. These mutations might not only affect the plasticity and diversity of evolved populations but could also impact bacterial fitness and virulence in infections.

ImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa uses quorum sensing (QS), a three-unit multi-layered network, to coordinate expression of traits for growth and virulence in the context of infections. Despite its importance for bacterial fitness, the QS regulon appears to be a common mutational target during long-term adaptation of P. aeruginosa in the host, natural environments and experimental evolutions. This raises the questions why such an important regulatory system is under selection and how mutations change the portfolio of QS-regulated traits. Here, we examine a set of 61 naturally evolved mutants to address these questions. We found that mutations involving the master regulator, LasR, resulted in an almost complete breakdown of QS, while mutations in RhlR and PqsR resulted in modulations of the QS regulon, where both the QS regulon structure and the QS-regulated trait portfolio changed. Our work reveals that natural selection drives diversification in QS activity patterns in evolving populations.","Jayakumar, P.; Figueiredo, A.; Kümmerli, R.",2022-04-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.04.27.489656,1,Rolf  Kümmerli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.27.489656v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.27.489656v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218031,Tackling Recalcitrant Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infections In Critical Illness via Anti-virulence Monotherapy,"Intestinal barrier derangement allows intestinal bacteria and their products to translocate to the systemic circulation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) superimposed infection in critically ill patients increases gut permeability and leads to gut-driven sepsis. PA infections are challenging due to multi-drug resistance (MDR), biofilms, and/or antibiotic tolerance. Inhibition of the quorum-sensing transcriptional regulator MvfR(PqsR) is a desirable anti-PA strategy as MvfR controls multiple acute and chronic virulence functions. Here we show that MvfR promotes intestinal permeability and report novel potent anti-MvfR compounds, the N-Aryl Malonamides (NAMs) resulting from extensive structure-activity-relationship studies and thorough assessment of the inhibition of MvfR-controlled virulence functions. This novel class of anti-virulence non-native ligand-based agents has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the nanomolar range and strong target engagement. Using a NAM lead in monotherapy protects murine intestinal barrier function, abolishes MvfR-regulated small molecules, ameliorates bacterial dissemination, and lowers inflammatory cytokines. This study demonstrates the importance of MvfR in PA-driven intestinal permeability. It underscores the utility of anti-MvfR agents in maintaining gut mucosal integrity, which should be part of any successful strategy to prevent/treat PA infections and associated gut-derived sepsis in critical illness settings. NAMs provide for the development of crucial preventive/therapeutic monotherapy options against untreatable MDR PA infections.","Singh, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218191,You will know by its tail: a method for quantification of heterogeneity of bacterial populations using single cell MIC profiling,"Severe non-healing infections are often caused by multiple pathogens or by genetic variants of the same pathogen exhibiting different levels of antibiotic resistance. For example, polymicrobial diabetic foot infections double the risk of amputation compared to monomicrobial infections. Although these infections lead to increased morbidity and mortality, standard antimicrobial susceptibility methods are designed for homogenous samples and are impaired in quantifying heteroresistance. Here, we propose a droplet-based label-free method for quantifying the antibiotic response of the entire population at the single-cell level. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus samples to confirm that the shape of the profile informs about the coexistence of diverse bacterial subpopulations, their sizes, and antibiotic heteroresistance. These profiles could therefore indicate the outcome of antibiotic treatment in terms of the size of remaining subpopulations. Moreover, we studied phenotypic variants of a S. aureus strain to confirm that the profile can be used to identify tolerant subpopulations, such as small colony variants, associated with increased risks for the development of persisting infections. Therefore, the profile is a versatile instrument for quantifying the size of each bacterial subpopulation within a specimen as well as their individual and joined heteroresistance.","Pacocha, N.; Zapotoczna, M.; Makuch, K.; Boguslawski, J.; Garstecki, P.",2022-04-29,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.04.29.490018,1,Karol  Makuch,Institute of Physical Chemistry PAS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.490018v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.490018v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218208,Comparison of R9.4.1/Kit10 and R10/Kit12 Oxford Nanopore flowcells and chemistries in bacterial genome reconstruction,"2.Complete, accurate, cost-effective, and high-throughput reconstruction of bacterial genomes for large-scale genomic epidemiological studies is currently only possible with hybrid assembly, combining long- (typically using nanopore sequencing) and short-read (Illumina) datasets. Being able to utilise nanopore-only data would be a significant advance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) have recently released a new flowcell (R10.4) and chemistry (Kit12), which reportedly generate per-read accuracies rivalling those of Illumina data. To evaluate this, we sequenced DNA extracts from four commonly studied bacterial pathogens, namely Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, using Illumina and ONTs R9.4.1/Kit10, R10.3/Kit12, R10.4/Kit12 flowcells/chemistries. We compared raw read accuracy and assembly accuracy for each modality, considering the impact of different nanopore basecalling models, commonly used assemblers, sequencing depth, and the use of duplex versus simplex reads. ""Super accuracy"" (sup) basecalled R10.4 reads - in particular duplex reads - have high per-read accuracies and could be used to robustly reconstruct bacterial genomes without the use of Illumina data. However, the per-run yield of duplex reads generated in our hands with standard sequencing protocols was low (typically <10%), with substantial implications for cost and throughput if relying on nanopore data only to enable bacterial genome reconstruction. In addition, recovery of small plasmids with the best-performing long-read assembler (Flye) was inconsistent. R10.4/Kit12 combined with sup basecalling holds promise as a singular sequencing technology in the reconstruction of commonly studied bacterial genomes, but hybrid assembly (Illumina+R9.4.1 hac) currently remains the highest throughput, most robust, and cost-effective approach to fully reconstruct these bacterial genomes.

3. Impact statementOur understanding of microbes has been greatly enhanced by the capacity to evaluate their genetic make-up using a technology known as whole genome sequencing. Sequencers represent microbial genomes as stretches of shorter sequence known as  reads, which are then assembled using computational algorithms. Different types of sequencing approach have advantages and disadvantages with respect to the accuracy and length of the reads they generate; this in turn affects how reliably genomes can be assembled.

Currently, to completely reconstruct bacterial genomes in a high-throughput and cost-effective manner, researchers tend to use two different types of sequencing data, namely Illumina (short-read) and nanopore (long-read) data. Illumina data are highly accurate; nanopore data are much longer, and this combination facilitates accurate and complete bacterial genomes in a so-called ""hybrid assembly"". However, new developments in nanopore sequencing have reportedly greatly improved the accuracy of nanopore data, hinting at the possibility of requiring only a single sequencing approach for bacterial genomics.

Here we evaluate these improvements in nanopore sequencing in the reconstruction of four bacterial reference strains, where the true sequence is already known. We show that although these improvements are extremely promising, for high-throughput, low-cost complete reconstruction of bacterial genomes hybrid assembly currently remains the optimal approach.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218189,A quorum sensing-regulated type VI secretion system containing multiple nonredundant VgrG proteins is required for interbacterial competition in Chromobacterium violaceum,"The environmental pathogenic bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum kills Gram-positive bacteria delivering violacein packed into outer membrane vesicles, but nothing is known about its contact-dependent competition mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that C. violaceum utilizes a type VI secretion system (T6SS) containing multiple VgrG proteins primarily for interbacterial competition. The single T6SS of C. violaceum contains six vgrG genes, which are located in the main T6SS cluster and four vgrG islands. Using T6SS-core component null mutant strains, western blot, fluorescence microscopy, and competition assays, we show that the C. violaceum T6SS is active and required for competition against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa but dispensable for C. violaceum infection in mice. Characterization of single and multiple vgrG mutants revealed that, despite having high sequence similarity, the six VgrGs show little functional redundancy, with VgrG3 showing a major role in T6SS function. Our coimmunoprecipitation data support a model of VgrG3 assembling heterotrimers with the other VgrGs. Moreover, we determined that the promoter activities of T6SS genes increased at high cell density, but the produced Hcp protein was not secreted under such condition. This T6SS growth-phase-dependent regulation was dependent on CviR but not on CviI, the components of a C. violaceum quorum sensing (QS) system. Indeed, a {Delta}cviR but not a {Delta}cviI mutant was completely defective in Hcp secretion, T6SS activity, and interbacterial competition. Overall, our data reveal that C. violaceum relies on a QS-regulated T6SS to outcompete other bacteria and expand our knowledge about the redundancy of multiple VgrGs.

IMPORTANCEThe type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile nanomachine used by many Gram-negative bacteria to inject toxic effectors into adjacent cells. The delivered effectors are bound to the components of a puncturing apparatus containing the protein VgrG. The T6SS has been implicated in pathogenesis and, more commonly, in competition among bacteria. Chromobacterium violaceum is an environmental bacterium that causes deadly infections in humans. In this work, we characterized the single T6SS of C. violaceum ATCC 12472, including its six VgrG proteins, regarding its function and regulation. This previously undescribed C. violaceum T6SS is active, regulated by QS, and required for interbacterial competition instead of acute infection in mice. Among the VgrGs, VgrG3, encoded outside of the main T6SS cluster, showed a major contribution to T6SS function. These results shed light on a key contact-dependent killing mechanism used by C. violaceum to antagonize other bacteria.","Alves, J. A.; Leal, F. C.; Previato-Mello, M.; Da Silva Neto, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,218982,Multicomponent Pseudomonas aeruginosa vaccines eliciting Th17 cells and functional antibody responses confer enhanced protection against experimental acute pneumonia in mice,"The Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of pneumonia in hospitalized patients. Its increasing antibiotic resistance and widespread occurrence present a pressing need for vaccines. We previously showed that a P. aeruginosa type III secretion system protein, PopB elicits a strong Th17 response in mice after intranasal (IN) immunization and confers antibody-independent protection against pneumonia in mice. In the current study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy in mice of the combination of PopB (purified with its chaperone protein PcrH) and OprF/I, an outer membrane hybrid fusion protein, compared to immunization with the proteins individually either by the intranasal (IN) or subcutaneous (SC) routes. Our results show that after vaccination, a Th17 recall response from splenocytes was detected only in mice vaccinated with PopB/PcrH, either alone or in combination with OprF/I. Mice that were immunized with the combination of PopB/PcrH and OprF/I had enhanced protection in an acute lethal P. aeruginosa pneumonia model, regardless of vaccine route, compared to the mice vaccinated the with either alone or adjuvant control. Immunization generated IgG titers against the vaccine proteins and whole P. aeruginosa cells. Interestingly, none of these antisera had opsonophagocytic killing activity, but antisera from mice immunized with vaccines containing OprF/I had the ability to block IFN-{gamma} binding to OprF/I, a known virulence mechanism. Hence, vaccines combining PopB/PcrH with OprF/I that elicit functional antibodies lead to a broadly and potently protective vaccine against P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections.","Shaikh, M. O.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,219295,Roughening instability of growing 3D bacterial colonies,"How do growing bacterial colonies get their shapes? While colony morphogenesis is well-studied in 2D, many bacteria grow as large colonies in 3D environments, such as gels and tissues in the body, or soils, sediments, and subsurface porous media. Here, we describe a morphological instability exhibited by large colonies of bacteria growing in 3D. Using experiments in transparent 3D granular hydrogel matrices, we show that dense colonies of four different species of bacteria--Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans--generically roughen as they consume nutrients and grow beyond a critical size, eventually adopting a characteristic branched, broccoli-like, self-affine morphology independent of variations in the cell type and environmental conditions. This behavior reflects a key difference between 2D and 3D colonies: while a 2D colony may access the nutrients needed for growth from the third dimension, a 3D colony inevitably becomes nutrient-limited in its interior, driving a transition to rough growth at its surface. We elucidate the onset of roughening using linear stability analysis and numerical simulations of a continuum model that treats the colony as an  active fluid whose dynamics are driven by nutrient-dependent cellular growth. We find that when all dimensions of the growing colony substantially exceed the nutrient penetration length, nutrient-limited growth drives a 3D morphological instability that recapitulates essential features of the experimental observations. Our work thus provides a framework to predict and control the organization of growing colonies--as well as other forms of growing active matter, such as tumors and engineered living materials--in 3D environments.","Martinez-Calvo, A.; Bhattacharjee, T.; Bay, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,219780,An Updated Gene Regulatory Network reconstruction of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCBH4851,"BACKGROUNDHealthcare-associated infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are significant public health issues worldwide. A system biology approach can help understand bacterial behavior and provide novel ways to identify potential therapeutic targets and the development of new drugs. Gene regulatory networks (GRN) are an example of interaction representation in silico between regulatory genes and their targets.

OBJECTIVESIn this work, we update the reconstruction of the MDR P. aeruginosa CCBH4851 GRN, and analyze and discuss its structural properties.

METHODSWe based this study on the gene orthology inference methodology using the reciprocal best hit method. The P. aeruginosa CCBH4851 genome and GRN, published in 2019, and the P. aeruginosa PAO1 GRN, published in 2020, were used for this update reconstruction process.

FINDINGSOur result is a GRN with a larger number of regulatory genes, target genes, and interactions compared to the previous networks, and its structural properties are consistent with the complexity of biological networks and the biological features of P. aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,219948,Surface-Induced cAMP Signaling Requires Multiple Features of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa Type IV Pili,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pili (TFP) are important for twitching motility and biofilm formation. TFP have been implicated in surface sensing, a process whereby surface-engaged cells up-regulate synthesis of the second messenger cAMP to propagate a signaling cascade leading to biofilm initiation and repression of motility. Here we show that mutations in PilA impairing proteolytic processing of the prepilin into mature pilin as well as the disruption of essential TFP components, including the PilC platform protein and PilB assembly motor protein, fail to induce surface-dependent cAMP signaling. We show that TFP retraction by surface-engaged cells is required to induce signaling, and that the retractile motor PilT is both necessary and sufficient to power surface-specific induction of cAMP. The PilU retraction motor, in contrast, is unable to support full signaling in the absence of PilT. Finally, while we have confirmed that PilA and PilJ interact by bacterial two-hybrid analysis, our data do not support the current model that PilJ-PilA interaction drives cAMP signaling.

ImportanceSurface sensing by P. aeruginosa requires TFP. TFP play a critical role in the induction of the second messenger cAMP upon surface contact; this second messenger is part of a larger cascade involved in the transition from a planktonic to biofilm lifestyle. Here we show that TFP must be deployed and actively retracted by the PilT motor for the full induction of cAMP signaling. Furthermore, the mechanism whereby TFP retraction triggers cAMP induction is not well understood, and our data argues against one of the current models in the field proposed to address this knowledge gap.","Kuchma, S.; O'toole, G.",2022-05-14,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.05.13.491915,1,George  O'toole,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.491915v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.491915v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,10.1128/jb.00186-22
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,219961,Adding a new dimension: Multi-level structure and organization of mixed-species Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms in a 4-D wound microenvironment,"Biofilms in wounds typically consist of aggregates of bacteria, most often Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, in close association with each other and the host microenvironment. Given this, the interplay across host and microbial elements, including the biochemical and nutrient profile of the microenvironment, likely influences the structure and organization of wound biofilms. While clinical studies, in vivo and ex vivo model systems have provided insights into the distribution of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in wounds, they are limited in their ability to provide a detailed characterization of biofilm structure and organization across the host-microbial interface. On the other hand, biomimetic in vitro systems, such as host cell surfaces and simulant media conditions, albeit reductionist, have been shown to support the co-existence of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms, with species-dependent localization patterns and interspecies interactions. Therefore, composite in vitro models that bring together key features of the wound microenvironment could provide unprecedented insights into the structure and organization of mixed-species biofilms. We have built a four-dimensional (4-D) wound microenvironment consisting of a 3-D host cell scaffold of co-cultured human epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, and an in vitro wound milieu (IVWM); the IVWM provides the fourth dimension that represents the biochemical and nutrient profile of the wound infection state. We leveraged this composite 4-D wound microenvironment to probe the structure of mixed-species P. aeruginosa and S. aureus biofilms across multiple levels of organization such as aggregate dimensions and biomass thickness, species co-localization and organization within the biomass, overall biomass composition and interspecies interactions. In doing so, the composite 4-D wound microenvironment platform provides multi-level insights into the structure of mixed-species biofilms, which we incorporate into the current understanding of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus organization in the wound bed.","Dhekane, R.; Mhade, S.; Kaushik, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,220572,Distinct types of multicellular aggregates in Pseudomonas aeruginosa liquid cultures,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms suspended multicellular aggregates when cultured in liquid media. Such aggregates may be important in disease, and/or as a pathway to biofilm formation. The polysaccharide Psl and extracellular DNA (eDNA) have both been implicated in aggregation, but previous results depend strongly on the experimental conditions. Here we develop a quantitative microscopy-based method for assessing changes in the size distribution of suspended aggregates over time in growing cultures. For exponentially growing cultures of P. aeruginosa PAO1, we find that aggregation is mediated by cell-associated Psl, rather than by either eDNA or se-creted Psl. These aggregates arise de novo within the culture via a growth process that involves both collisions and clonal growth. They are ""non-cheatable"" since Psl non-producing cells do not aggregate with producers. In contrast, we find that stationary phase (overnight) cultures contain a different type of multicelullar aggregate, in which both eDNA and Psl mediate cohesion. Our findings suggest that the physical and bi-ological properties of multicellular aggregates may be very different in early-stage vs late-stage bacterial cultures.","Melaugh, G.; Martinez, V.; Baker, P.; Hill, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,220593,Self-organized canals enable long range directed material transport in bacterial communities,"Long-range material transport is essential to maintain the physiological functions of multicellular organisms such as animals and plants. By contrast, material transport in bacteria is often short-ranged and limited by diffusion. Here we report a unique form of actively regulated long-range directed material transport in structured bacterial communities. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies as a model system, we discover that a large-scale and temporally evolving open channel system spontaneously develops in the colony via shear-induced banding. Fluid flows in the open channels support high-speed (up to 450 {micro}m/s) transport of cells and outer membrane vesicles over centimeters, and help to eradicate colonies of a competing species Staphylococcus aureus. The open channels are reminiscent of human-made canals for cargo transport, and the channel flows are driven by interfacial tension mediated by cell-secreted biosurfactants. The spatial-temporal dynamics of fluid flows in the open channels are qualitatively described by flow profile measurement and mathematical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that mechanochemical coupling between interfacial force and biosurfactant kinetics can coordinate large-scale material transport in primitive life forms, suggesting a new principle to engineer self-organized microbial communities.","Li, Y.; Liu, S.; Zhang, Y.; Seng, Z.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,220962,Identification and characterisation of potent anti-MRSA phloroglucinol derivatives of Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai,"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to treat infectious diseases and could offer potential drug leads. This study evaluates the in vitro antimicrobial activities commercially sourced Dryopteris crassirhizoma Nakai whose authenticity was confirmed by DNA barcoding based on the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) gene. Powdered rhizomes were sequentially extracted using n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and methanol at ambient temperature. The dried extracts at different concentrations were tested for antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Mycobacterium smegmatis. D. crassirhizoma extracts exhibited significant antimicrobial activities only against MRSA. Activity-led fractionations of D. crassirhizoma and characterisation by Ultra performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) identified two potent anti-MRSA phloroglucinol derivatives: Norflavaspidic acid AB and flavaspidic acid AB. The impact of norflavaspidic acid AB on MRSA cells was examined using untargeted metabolomic analysis and compared to that of other established antibiotics (all treatments normalized to MIC50 at 6 h).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,221305,The selection of antibiotic- and bacteriophage-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is prevented by their combination,"ObjectivesBacteria developing resistance compromise the efficacy of antibiotics or bacteriophages (phages). We tested the association of these two antibacterials to circumvent resistance.

MethodsWith the Hollow Fiber Infection Model (HFIM), we mimicked the concentration profile of ciprofloxacin in the lungs of patients treated orally for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections and independently, mimicked a single inhaled administration of phages (one or two phages).

ResultsEach treatment selects for antibiotic-or phage-resistant clones in less than 30 h. By contrast, no bacteria were recovered from the HFIM at 72 h when ciprofloxacin was started 4 h post-phage administration, even when increasing the initial bacterial concentration by a 1000 fold.

ConclusionThe combination of phages with antibiotics used according to clinical regimens prevents the growth of resistant clones, providing opportunities to downscale the use of multiple antibiotics.","Ferran, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,221451,Pseudomonas aeruginosa contracts mucus to rapidly form biofilms in tissue-engineered human airways,"Bacteria commonly protect themselves by forming multicellular structures called biofilms. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes antibiotic-recalcitrant pneumonia by forming biofilms in the respiratory tract. Despite extensive in vitro experimentation, how P. aeruginosa forms biofilms at the airway mucosal surface is unresolved. We investigated P. aeruginosa biofilm biogenesis in optically-accessible tissue-engineered human lung models that emulate the airway mucosal environment. We found that P. aeruginosa forms mucus-associated biofilms within hours, much faster than previously observed in in vitro experiments. Early during colonization, P. aeruginosa induces contractions of luminal mucus which accelerates bacterial aggregation. We show that P. aeruginosa uses retractile type IV pili to actively compress mucus. Our results suggest that, while protecting epithelia, mucus constitutes a breeding ground for biofilms.","Rossy, T.; Distler, T.; Pezoldt, J.; Kim, J.; Tala, L.; Bouklas, N.; Deplancke, B.; Persat, A.",2022-05-26,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.05.26.493615,1,Alexandre  Persat,EPFL,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.26.493615v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.26.493615v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,221529,Effect of chemical modifications of tannins on their antibiofilm effect against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria,"(1) BackgroundTannins have demonstrated antibacterial and antibiofilm activity, but the mechanisms of action are not completely elucidated. We are interested in understanding how to modulate the antibiofilm activity of tannins and in delineating the relationship between chemical determinants and antibiofilm activity.

(2) Materials and methodsthe effect of five different naturally acquired tannins and their chemical derivatives on biofilm formation and planktonic growth of Salmonella Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was determined in the Calgary biofilm device.

(3) Resultsmost of the unmodified tannins exhibited specific antibiofilm activity against the assayed bacteria. The chemical modifications were found to alter the antibiofilm activity level and spectrum of the tannins, with the positive charge introducing C3NMe3Cl-0.5 derivatization shifting the anti-biofilm spectrum towards Gram-negative bacteria and C3NMe3Cl-0.1 and the acidifying CH3COOH derivatization shifting the spectrum towards Gram-positive bacteria. Also, the quantity of phenolic-OH groups per molecule has a weak impact on the anti-biofilm activity of the tannins.

(4) Conclusionswe were able to modulate the antibiofilm activity of several tannins by specific chemical modifications, providing a first approach for fine tuning of their activity and spectrum.","Villanueva, X.; Zhen, L.; Nunez Ares, J.; Vackier, T.; Lange, H.; Crestini, C.; Steenackers, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,222024,Within-species control reveals novel immune response genes in Caenorhabditis elegans,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a simple model host for studying the interaction between bacterial pathogens and the metazoan innate immune system. In the last two decades, much focus has been given to studying intestinal infection in the worm by the clinical strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. Powerful genetic and molecular tools in both species facilitate the identification and analysis of bacterial virulence factors as well as host defense factors.

However, findings from these studies are confounded by the use of the genetically, metabolically, and physiologically divergent E. coli OP50 as a food source and as the non-virulent control. Here we report the use of P. aeruginosa z11 strain as a preferable control for PA14 infection studies. We demonstrate that many aspects of worm behavior, health-span, longevity, food attraction, brood size, lifespan, and pathogen avoidance and survival are not affected in z11. We show that the use of z11 as a control for transcriptomics analysis can increase the discovery power. In particular, we identified three novel pathogenesis-related genes in C. elegans. Our findings accentuate the importance of choosing an appropriate control environment for host-pathogen studies.","Ranawade, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,222080,Role of the drug efflux pump in the intrinsic cefiderocol resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic exhibiting activities against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Drug efflux pumps are reportedly involved in both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance, although their role in bacterial cefiderocol susceptibility remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how drug efflux pumps contribute to bacterial cefiderocol susceptibility using the efflux pump(s)-deficient and overexpressing strains of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella enterica. We observed that the mexAB-oprM-deficient P. aeruginosa mutant displayed increased cefiderocol susceptibility compared to the wild-type strain. The overexpression of mexAB-oprM or mexXY-oprM in the mexAB-oprM-deficient mutant increased the MIC value of cefiderocol. Furthermore, the pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine {beta}-naphthylamide increased cefiderocol susceptibility in wild-type P. aeruginosa whereas it did not affect the susceptibility of the mexAB-oprM-deficient mutant. These data indicate that the MexAB-OprM drug efflux system contributes to the intrinsic cefiderocol resistance of P. aeruginosa. In addition, MexXY-OprM partially complemented the function of MexAB-OprM in the cefiderocol susceptibility, when expressed.","Ikawa, S.; Yamasaki, S.; Morita, Y.; Nishino, K.",2022-06-01,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.05.31.494263,1,Kunihiko  Nishino,Osaka University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.31.494263v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.31.494263v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,222101,The Protein Interaction Networks of Catalytically-Active and Catalytically-Inactive PqsE in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen that relies on quorum sensing to establish infections. The PqsE quorum-sensing protein is required for P. aeruginosa virulence factor production and infection. PqsE has a reported enzymatic function in the biosynthesis of the quorum-sensing autoinducer called PQS. However, this activity is redundant because, in the absence of PqsE, this role is fulfilled by alternative thioesterases. Rather, PqsE drives P. aeruginosa pathogenic traits via a protein-protein interaction with the quorum-sensing receptor/transcription factor, RhlR, an interaction that enhances affinity of RhlR for target DNA sequences. PqsE catalytic activity is dispensable for interaction with RhlR. Thus, PqsE virulence function can be decoupled from its catalytic function. Here, we present an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry method employing eGFP-PqsE fusions to define the protein interactomes of wildtype PqsE and the catalytically inactive PqsE(D73A) variant in P. aeruginosa and their dependence on RhlR. Several proteins were identified to have specific interactions with wildtype PqsE, while not forming associations with PqsE(D73A). In the {Delta}rhlR strain, an increased number of specific PqsE interactors were identified, including the partner autoinducer synthase to RhlR, called RhlI. Collectively, these results suggest that specific protein-protein interactions depend on PqsE catalytic activity and that RhlR may prevent proteins from interacting with PqsE, possibly due to competition between RhlR and other proteins for PqsE binding. Our results provide a foundation for the identification of the in vivo PqsE catalytic function and, potentially, new proteins involved in P. aeruginosa quorum sensing.

IMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa causes hospital-borne infections in vulnerable patients, including in immunocompromised individuals, burn victims, and cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. There are no effective treatments for P. aeruginosa infections, which are usually broadly resistant to antibiotics. Animal models show that to establish infection and to cause illness, P. aeruginosa relies on an interaction between two proteins: PqsE and RhlR. There could be additional protein-protein interactions involving PqsE, which, if defined, could be exploited for the design of new therapeutic strategies to combat P. aeruginosa. Here, we reveal previously unknown protein interactions in which PqsE participates that will be investigated for potential roles in pathogenesis.","Taylor, I.; Murray-Nerger, L. A.; Cristea, I.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,222412,Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from both clinical and environmental origins readily adopt a stable small colony variant (SCV) phenotype resulting from single mutations in c-di-GMP pathways,"A subpopulation of Small Colony Variants (SCVs) is a frequently observed feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from colonized cystic fibrosis lungs. Since most SCVs have until now been isolated from clinical samples, it remains unclear how widespread is the ability of P. aeruginosa to develop this phenotype and the genetic mechanism(s) behind SCVs emergence according to the origin of the isolate. In the present work, we investigated the ability of 22 P. aeruginosa isolates from various environmental origins to, under laboratory culture conditions, spontaneously adopt a SCV-like smaller alternative morphotype distinguishable from the ancestral parent strain. We found that all the P. aeruginosa strains tested could adopt a SCV phenotype, regardless of their origin. Whole genome sequencing of SCVs obtained from clinical and environmental sources revealed single mutations exclusively in two distinct c-di-GMP signaling pathways, Wsp and YfiBNR. We conclude that the ability to switch to a SCV phenotype is a conserved feature of P. aeruginosa and results from the acquisition of a stable genetic mutation, regardless of the origin of the strain.

IMPORTANCEP. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in many environments. It poses a significant health concern, notably because this bacterium is the most prevalent pathogen found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. In infected hosts, its persistence is considered related to the emergence of an alternative small colony variant (SCV) phenotype. By reporting the distribution of P. aeruginosa SCVs in various non-clinical environments and the involvement of c-di-GMP in SCV emergence from both clinical and environmental strains, this work contributes to understanding a conserved adaptation mechanism used by P. aeruginosa to adapt readily in all environments. Hindering this adaptation strategy could help control P. aeruginosa persistent infection.","Besse, A.; Groleau, M.-C.; Trottier, M.; Vincent, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,223769,A library of promoter-gfp fusion reporters for studying systemic expression pattern of cyclic-di-GMP metabolism-related genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental microorganism, which is notorious for its resistance or tolerance to antibiotics due to the formation of biofilms. Cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger that plays critical roles in biofilm formation. P. aeruginosa contains 41 genes that encode enzymes to participate in the metabolism of c-di-GMP (biosynthesis or degradation), yet it lacks tools to investigate the systemic expression pattern of those genes. Here, we constructed a promoter-gfp transcriptional fusion reporters library that consists of 41 reporter plasmids. Each plasmid contains a promoter of corresponding c-di-GMP metabolism-related (CMR) genes from P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain, thus each promoter-Gfp fusion reporter can be used to detect the promotor activity as well as the transcription of corresponding gene. The promoters activity was tested in P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli respectively. Among the 41 genes, the promoter of 26 genes showed activity in both P. aeruginosa and E. coli. The library was applied to determine the influence of different temperatures, growth media, and sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics on transcriptional profile of the 41 CMR genes in P. aeruginosa. The results showed different growth conditions did impact different genes transcription, while the promoter activity of a few genes kept at the same level under several different growth conditions. In summary, we provided a promoter-gfp fusion reporters library for systemic monitoring or study of the regulation of CMR genes in P. aeruginosa and the functional promoters can also be used as a bio-brick for synthetic biology studies.

ImportanceThe opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa can cause acute and chronic infections in humans and it is one of main pathogens in nosocomial infections. Biofilm formation is one of most important causes for P. aeruginosa to persist in hosts and evade immune and antibiotic attacks. c-di-GMP is an important second messenger to control biofilm formation. In P. aeruginosa, there are 41 genes that are predicted to participate in the making and breaking this dinucleotide. A major missing information in this field is the systemic expression profile of those genes in response to changing environment. Toward this goal, we constructed a promoter-gfp transcriptional fusion reporters library that consists of 41 reporter plasmids, each of which contains a promoter of corresponding c-di-GMP metabolism-related genes in P. aeruginosa. This library provides a helpful tool to understand the complex regulation network related to c-di-GMP and to discover potential therapeutic targets.","Liu, D.; Wang, D.; Wei, Q.; Zhang, Y.; Ma, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,224068,Differential metabolism between biofilm and suspended Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures in bovine synovial fluid by 2D NMR-based metabolomics,"Total joint arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure resulting in improved quality of life; however, a leading cause of surgery failure is periprosthetic joint infection. Periprosthetic infection often involves biofilms, making treatment challenging. Periprosthetic joint infections are difficult to diagnose by traditional culturing methods and there are no clinical biomarkers for the presence of biofilms. Further, the metabolic state of pathogens in the joint space is difficult to diagnose, the mechanism of their tolerance to antibiotics and host defenses is not well understood, and their culturing in the laboratory is challenging. Thus, there is a critical need for improved pathogen- and phenotype-specific diagnosis as well as improved treatment strategies toward better patient outcomes. Here, we present a quantitative, untargeted NMR-based metabolomics strategy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspended culture and biofilm phenotypes grown in bovine synovial fluid. We identified 21 unique metabolites as potential markers of P. aeruginosa and one unique marker of the biofilm phenotype in synovial fluid. Significant differences in metabolic pathways were found between the suspended culture and biofilm phenotypes including creatine, glutathione, alanine, and choline metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These unique metabolite and pathway differences have the potential to serve as targets for P. aeruginosa and specifically biofilm diagnosis and biofilm control in synovial fluid.

Author SummaryJoint replacement surgery is a common procedure frequently required in later stages of life due to damage in the joint. Over one million joint replacement surgeries are performed annually with rates increasing every year. A devastating complication associated with joint replacement is the development of infection around the implant device in the joint space, known as a periprosthetic joint infection. Bacteria in the joint space can form a biofilm, which is a gel-like matrix encasing the cells that increases resistance to treatment and exacerbates chronic infections. A particular challenge for the diagnosis of biofilm-mediated periprosthetic joint infections is the slowly growing nature of biofilm-mediated phenotypes, resulting in frequent failure to detect these bacteria by clinical microbiological culturing methods. Small molecule metabolites are uniquely produced by strains of bacteria in the biofilm versus planktonic or suspended culture phenotype. Identification of metabolites as specific markers of infection and biofilm could allow a new culture-free diagnostic approach to diagnose infection by biofilm. Furthermore, knowledge of metabolic pathway populations in biofilm in joint fluid could point to specific targets to prevent biofilm formation in the joint space.","Leggett, A.; Li, D.-W.; Bruschweiler-Li, L.; Sullivan, A.; Stoodley, P.; Brüschweiler, R.",2022-06-17,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.06.16.496519,1,Rafael  Brüschweiler,The Ohio State University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.16.496519v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.16.496519v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,224245,Reduction of a heme cofactor initiates N-nitroglycine degradation by NnlA,"The NnlA enzyme from Variovorax sp. strain JS1663 degrades the linear nitramine N-nitroglycine (NNG)--a natural product produced by some bacteria--to glyoxylate and nitrite (NO2-). Ammonium (NH4+) was predicted as the third product of this reaction. A source of non-heme FeII was shown to be required for initiation of NnlA activity. However, it was unclear if this FeII was being used as a metallocofactor or a reductant. This study reveals that NnlA contains a b-type heme cofactor. Reduction of this heme is required to initiate NnlA activity. Reduction can occur either by addition of a non-heme FeII source or by reduction with dithionite. Therefore, FeII is not an essential substrate for holoenzyme activity. Data are presented showing that reduced NnlA (FeII-NnlA) can catalyze at least 100 turnovers. In addition, this catalysis occurred in the absence of O2. Finally, NH4+ was verified as the third product, accounting for the complete nitrogen mass balance. Size exclusion chromatography showed that NnlA is a dimer in solution. Additionally, FeII-NnlA is oxidized by O2 and NO2- and binds carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO). These are characteristics shared with PAS domains; NnlA was previously shown to exhibit homology with such domains. Providing further evidence, a structural homology model of NnlA was generated based on the structure of the PAS domain from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aer2. The structural homology model suggested His73 is the axial ligand of the NnlA heme. Site-directed mutagenesis of His73 to alanine decreased the heme occupancy of NnlA and eliminated NNG activity, providing evidence that the homology model is valid. We conclude that NnlA forms a homodimeric heme-binding PAS domain protein that requires reduction for initiation of the activity.

ImportanceLinear nitramines are potential carcinogens. These compounds result from environmental degradation of high-energy cyclic nitramines and as by-products of carbon capture technologies. Mechanistic understanding of the biodegradation of linear nitramines is critical to inform approaches for their remediation. The best understood biodegradation of a linear nitramine is NNG degradation by NnlA from Variovorax sp. strain JS 1663; however, it is unclear why non-heme iron was required to initiate enzymatic turnover. This study shows that non-heme iron is unnecessary. Instead, our study reveals that NnlA contains a heme cofactor, the reduction of which is critical for activating NNG degradation activity. These studies constrain the proposals for NnlA reaction mechanisms, thereby informing mechanistic studies of degradation of anthropogenic nitramine contaminants. In addition, these results will future work to design biocatalysts to degrade these nitramine contaminants.","Strickland, K. A.; Holland, A. A.; Trudeau, A.; Szlamkowicz, I.; Beazley, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,224676,Community composition shapes microbial-specific phenotypes in a cystic fibrosis polymicrobial model system,"Interspecies interactions can drive the emergence of unexpected microbial phenotypes that are not observed when studying monocultures. The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung consists of a complex environment where particular microbes, living as polymicrobial biofilm-like communities, are associated with negative clinical outcomes for persons with CF (pwCF). However, the current lack of in vitro models integrating the microbial diversity observed in the CF airway hampers our understanding of why polymicrobial communities are recalcitrant to therapy in this disease. Here, integrating computational approaches informed by clinical data, we built a mixed community of clinical relevance to the CF lung composed of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis and Prevotella melaninogenica. We developed and validated this model biofilm community with multiple isolates of these four genera. When challenged with tobramycin, a front-line antimicrobial used to treat pwCF, the microorganisms in the polymicrobial community show altered sensitivity to this antibiotic compared to monospecies biofilms. We observed that wild-type P. aeruginosa is sensitized to tobramycin in a mixed community versus monoculture, and this observation holds across a range of community relative abundances. We also report that LasR loss-of-function, a variant frequently detected in the CF airway, induces tolerance of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin specifically in the mixed community. The molecular basis of this community-specific recalcitrance to tobramycin for the LasR mutant variant is the increased production of redox-active phenazines. Our data support the importance of studying clinically-relevant model polymicrobial biofilms to understand community-specific traits relevant to infections.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe CF lung is colonized by biofilm-like microbial communities that exhibit both resistance and tolerance (collectively called ""recalcitrance"") to antimicrobials used in the clinic. Here, we leveraged clinical data from pwCF to inform our understanding of communities exhibiting recalcitrance. We developed and validated an in vitro model that revealed novel, community-specific phenotypes relevant to the clinic. We used this model to explore the underlying mechanism associated with a community-specific emergent behavior. We posit that in vitro models of polymicrobial communities may help in developing new antimicrobial strategies to improve patient outcomes, and that the approach used here can be applied to other polymicrobial models.","Jean-Pierre, F.; Hampton, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,224680,Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediates PqsA-dependent iron regulation of the RsmY and RsmZ sRNAs in static conditions,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that causes acute and chronic lung infection in compromised hosts. During infection, the host innate immune system restricts iron to limit microbial growth. In response, P. aeruginosa induces expression of numerous virulence genes. Recently, our lab showed that some virulence factors are responsive to iron limitation in static but not shaking growth conditions, the former of which is likely to mimic growth in the chronically-infected lung. One of these novel iron-responsive factors is the HSI-2-type six secretion system (T6SS), which is also induced during chronic infection. Iron regulation of T6SS was partially impacted by deletion of the iron-responsive PrrF sRNA and completely dependent upon the Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) biosynthetic gene pqsA. Here, we analyzed the impact of iron on the expression of two small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), RsmY and RsmZ, that activate expression of T6SS by sequestering the RsmA translation inhibitor. Our results demonstrate that iron starvation induces expression of RsmY and RsmZ in static but not shaking cultures. We further show that this induction occurs through the rsmY and rsmZ promoters and is dependent upon PqsA. We identified interrupted palindromes in the rsmY and rsmZ promoters as putative PqsR binding sites, and disruption of these sites eliminated iron-dependent regulation of rsmY and rsmZ promoter activity. To determine if iron-dependent regulation of the Rsm sRNAs is likely responsible for iron regulation of HSI-2 T6SS, we constructed translational and transcriptional reporters of the hsiA2 T6SS gene. Analysis of these reporters revealed robust PqsA-mediated iron regulation of the transcriptional reporter, as well as modest PrrF-dependent iron regulation of the translational reporter. Taken together, our results show novel iron regulatory pathways that are promoted by static growth, highlighting the importance of studying regulatory mechanisms in static communities that are likely more representative of chronic P. aeruginosa infections.

IMPORTANCEIron is a central component of various bacterial metabolic pathways making it an important host acquired nutrient for pathogens to establish infection. Previous iron regulatory studies primaried relied on shaking bacterial cultures; while these ensure cultural homogeneity they do not reflect growth conditions during infection. We recently showed that static growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes iron-dependent regulation of a type six secretion system (T6SS), a virulence factor that is induced during chronic infections. In the current study, we found that static growth also promotes iron-dependent regulation of the RsmY and RsmZ sRNAs, which are global regulators that affect T6SS during chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. Hence, our work demonstrates the Rsm sRNAs as potential effectors of iron regulation during static growth that may also be relevant in chronic infection.","Chourashi, R.; Oglesby, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225165,Cooperation genes are more pleiotropic than private genes in the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pleiotropy may affect the evolution of cooperation by limiting cheater mutants if such mutants also lose other important traits. Because pleiotropy limits cheaters, selection may favor cooperation genes that are more pleiotropic. However, the same should not be true for private genes with functions unrelated to cooperation. Pleiotropy in cooperative genes has mostly been studied with single genes and has not been measured on a wide scale or compared to a suitable set of control genes with private functions. I remedy this gap by comparing genomic measures of pleiotropy in previously identified cooperative and private gene sets in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. I found that cooperative genes in P. aeruginosa tended to be more pleiotropic than private genes according to the number of protein-protein interactions, the number of gene ontology terms, and gene expression specificity. These results show that pleiotropy may be a general way to limit cheating and that cooperation may shape pleiotropy in the genome.","Scott, T.

But how this rhamnolipids interact with biogels to assist swarming remains unclear. Here I use a combination of optical techniques across scales and genetically-engineered strains to demonstrate that rhamnolipids can induce agar gel swelling over distances >10,000x the body size of an individual cell. The swelling front is on the micrometric scale, and is easily visible using shadowgraphy. Rhamnolipid transport is not restricted to the surface of the gel, but occurs through the whole thickness of the plate and, consequently, the spreading dynamics depends on the local thickness. Surprisingly, rhamnolipids can cross the whole gel and induce swelling on the opposite side of a two-face Petri dish. The swelling front delimits an area where the mechanical properties of the surface properties are modified: water wets the surface more easily, which increases the motility of individual bacteria and enables collective motility. A genetically-engineered mutant unable to secrete rhamnolipids (rhlA-), and therefore unable to swarm, is rescued from afar with rhamnolipids produced by a remote colony. These results exemplify the remarkable capacity of bacteria to change the physical environment around them and its ecological consequences.","Deforet, M.",2022-09-02,Systems Biology,10.1101/2022.06.29.498166,3,Maxime  Deforet,Sorbonne Universite,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.498166v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.29.498166v3.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225408,Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes persistence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia via increased adherence to depolarized respiratory epithelium,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging opportunistic respiratory pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). S. maltophilia is frequently observed in polymicrobial infections, and we have previously shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes colonization and persistence of S. maltophilia in mouse respiratory infections. In this study, we used host and bacterial RNA sequencing to further define this interaction. To evaluate S. maltophilia transcript profiles we used a recently described method for selective capture of bacterial mRNA transcripts with strain specific RNA probes. We found that factors associated with the type IV pilus, including the histidine kinase subunit of a chemotactic two-component signaling system (chpA), had increased transcript levels during polymicrobial infection. Using immortalized CF respiratory epithelial cells, we found that infection with P. aeruginosa increases adherence of S. maltophilia, at least in part due to disruption of epithelial tight junctions. In contrast, an isogenic S. maltophilia chpA mutant lacked cooperative adherence to CF epithelia and decreased bacterial burden in vivo in polymicrobial infections with P. aeruginosa. Similarly, P. aeruginosa lacking elastase (lasB) did not promote S. maltophilia adherence or bacterial colonization and persistence in vivo. Based on these results, we conclude that disruption of lung tissue integrity by P. aeruginosa promotes adherence of S. maltophilia to the lung epithelia in a type IV pilus-dependent manner. These data provide insight into S. maltophilia colonization and persistence in patients in later stages of CF disease and may have implications for interactions with other bacterial opportunists.

IMPORTANCEDespite advances in treatment options for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), complications of bacterial infections remain the greatest driver of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. These infections often involve more than one bacterial pathogen, and our understanding of how inter-species interactions impact disease progression is lacking. Previous work in our lab found that two CF pathogens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cooperatively infect the lung to cause more severe infection. In the present study, we found that infection with P. aeruginosa promotes persistence of S. maltophilia by interfering with epithelial barrier integrity. Depolarization of the epithelial cell layer by P. aeruginosa secreted elastase increased S. maltophilia adherence, likely in a type IV pilus-dependent manner. Ultimately, this work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms governing an important polymicrobial interaction seen in pulmonary diseases such as CF.","Mcdaniel, M. S.; Lindgren, N.; Billiot, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225388,Pseudomonas aeruginosa transcriptome analysis in a cystic fibrosis lung model reveals metabolic changes accompanying biofilm maturation and increased antibiotic tolerance over time.,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilm infections in the lungs of people with the genetic condition cystic fibrosis (CF) that can persist for decades. There are numerous P. aeruginosa lifestyle changes associated with chronic biofilm infection cued by the CF lung environment. These include a loss of virulence, metabolic changes, and increased antimicrobial tolerance. We have investigated P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm infection over 7 d in an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for CF, previously shown to facilitate formation of a clinically-relevant P. aeruginosa biofilm structure with gene expression comparable to human infection. We extracted and sequenced P. aeruginosa RNA from EVPL-associated biofilms 24 h, 48 h, and 7 d after infection, and compared gene expression between sequential time points. We also investigated tolerance to polymyxins across these three time points. Our results indicate that the EVPL model can maintain a P. aeruginosa biofilm population, which exhibits increased antibiotic tolerance, for at least 7 d. Differential expression of antimicrobial resistance-associated genes was not observed, however there was significant upregulation of sulfur metabolism and phenazine biosynthesis-related genes, as well as maintenance of a structured biofilm. These findings provide further insight into the incidence of increased P. aeruginosa antibiotic tolerance during infection of the CF lung, and the gene expression changes that arise as chronic infection establishes.","Harrington, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225502,Redundancy in citrate and cis-aconitate transport in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Tricarboxylates such as citrate are the preferred carbon sources for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic human infections. However, the membrane transport process for the TCA cycle intermediates citrate and cis-aconitate is poorly characterized. Transport is thought to be controlled by the TctDE two-component system, which mediates transcription of the putative major transporter OpdH. Loss of tctDE has been associated with sensitization to aminoglycosides, possibly linking tricarboxylate transport to enhanced antimicrobial resistance. In this work, we search for previously unidentified transporters of citrate and cis-aconitate using both protein homology and RNA sequencing approaches. We uncover new transporters and show that OpdH is not the major citrate porin; instead, citrate transport primarily relies on the tripartite TctCBA system, which is encoded in the opdH operon. Deletion of tctA causes a growth lag on citrate and loss of growth on cis-aconitate. Combinatorial deletion of newly discovered transporters can fully block citrate utilization. We then characterize transcriptional control of the opdH operon in tctDE mutants and show that loss of tctD blocks citrate utilization due to its inability to express opdH-tctCBA. However, tctE and tctDE mutants evolve heritable adaptations that restore growth on citrate as the sole carbon source.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that infects hospitalized patients and is often highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. It preferentially uses small organic acids called tricarboxylates rather than sugars as a source of carbon for growth. The transport of many of these molecules from outside the cell to the interior occurs through unknown channels. In some cases, there may be links between antibiotic uptake and the transport of metabolic molecules, making cross-membrane transport medically important. In this work we examined how the tricarboxylates citrate and cis-aconitate are transported in P. aeruginosa. We then sought to understand how production of proteins that permit citrate and cis-aconitate transport is regulated by a signaling system called TctDE. We identified new transporters for these molecules, clarified the function of a known transport system, and directly tied transporter expression to the presence of an intact TctDE system.","Underhill, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225941,Structural analysis of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae reveals conformational changes upon cofactor binding,"Isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis is an essential part of primary metabolism in all living organisms. While eukaryotes utilize the mevalonate (MEV) pathway for isoprenoid-precursor biosynthesis, the most important bacterial pathogens rely on the methylerythritol-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Therefore, enzymes involved in the MEP pathway are potentially valuable targets for the development of novel antibacterials to tackle the current antimicrobial resistance crisis. Within the MEP pathway, the enzyme 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXPS) represents a crucial, rate-limiting first step and a branch point in the biosynthesis of the vitamins B1 and B6. Herein, we present two novel, high-resolution DXPS crystal structures of the important ESKAPE pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae in both the co-factor-bound and apo forms. We demonstrate that the absence of the cofactor ThDP leads to a disordered loop close to the active site and may be important for the design of potent DXPS inhibitors, albeit being different in both structures. In addition, we report the complex structure of paDXPS with a fluoropyruvate adduct, shedding more light on the structural basis of DXPS catalysis. Lastly, we have determined a complex structure of paDXPS with a thiamine analogue, opening up a route for structure-based drug design of this essential enzyme of the MEP pathway.","Hamid, R.; Adam, S.; Lacour, A.; Monjas Gomez, L.; Hirsch, A.",2022-07-04,Molecular Biology,10.1101/2022.07.04.498669,1,Rawia  Hamid,"Helmholtz Institute for Pharmaceutical Research Saarland (HIPS)-Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI), Campus Building E8.1, 66123 Saarbrucken.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498669v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498669v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,225938,Mucosal administration of anti-bacterial antibody provides long-term cross-protection against Pseudomonas aeruginosa respiratory infection,"Bacterial respiratory infections, associated with acute, sometimes recurrent infections and with chronic respiratory diseases, are a major threat for human health. Mucosal administration of therapeutic antibodies (Ab), using the airways as a delivery route, has a tremendous opportunity to benefit to patients with respiratory infections, with remarkable preclinical achievements in both viral and bacterial respiratory infection models and ongoing clinical developments. The primary mode of action of anti-infective Ab delivered through the airways is pathogen neutralization and to a lesser extent, Fc-mediated direct recruitment of immune effectors to facilitate their elimination. Using a mouse model of acute pneumonia induced by P. aeruginosa, a bacterium frequently associated with multidrug resistance and a high rate of recurrence, we characterized an immunomodulatory mode of action of anti-bacterial Ab. Beyond the rapid and efficient containment of the primary infection, the anti-infective Ab delivered through the airways harnessed adaptive immunity to provide a long-term response, preventing from a secondary pathogen infection. This effect is specific and dependent on the Ab dose, intensity of infection and antigen expression by the pathogen upon primary infection. As shown by adoptive transfer experiments, it is mediated by a sustained and protective humoral immune response. Interestingly, the long-lasting response protected partially against secondary infections due to heterologous P. aeruginosa strains. Overall, our findings suggest that mucosal delivery of Ab through the airways offers a dual advantage: a rapid onset of action to neutralize respiratory bacteria and a long-term protection against secondary infections, thereby opening novel perspectives for the development of anti-infective antibody delivered to the lung mucosa, to treat respiratory infections.","Pitiot, A.; Ferreira, M.; Parent, C.; Boisseau, C.; Cortes, M.; Bouvart, L.; Paget, C.; Heuze-Vourc'h, N.; Secher, T.",2022-07-04,Immunology,10.1101/2022.07.04.498699,1,Thomas  Secher,INSERM - CEPR U1100,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498699v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.04.498699v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,226035,The uncharacterized protein YgfB contributes to β-lactam resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting the expression of the amidase AmpDh3,"YgfB was recently identified as an enigmatic factor that contributes to {beta}-lactam resistance of multi drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show here that YgfB upregulates the expression of the chromosomally encoded {beta}-lactamase AmpC by antagonizing the function of the regulator of the programmed cell death pathway AlpA. As an anti-terminator, AlpA induces the expression of the alpBCDE lysis genes and the amidase AmpDh3. AmpDh3 activity in turn reduces the levels of cell wall-derived 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramyl-peptides (anhMurNAc-peptides), which stimulate the activator function of the transcriptional regulator AmpR, thereby promoting the expression of ampC and {beta}-lactam resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ciprofloxacin-mediated DNA damage induces AlpA-dependent production of AmpDh3, thereby reducing the minimal inhibitory concentration of {beta}-lactam antibiotics required to kill P. aeruginosa. YgfB is also instrumental in dampening this synergistic action. Altogether, our work highlights the contribution of YgfB to {beta}-lactam and ciprofloxacin/{beta}-lactam resistance and pinpoints a new potential antimicrobial target.","Eggers, O.; Renschler, F.; Michalek, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,226171,Validated Preclinical Murine Model for Therapeutic Testing against Multidrug Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The rise in infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria is outpacing the development of new antibiotics. The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are a group of clinically important bacteria that have developed resistance to multiple antibiotics and are commonly referred to as multidrug resistant (MDR). The medical and research communities have recognized that without new antimicrobials, infections by MDR bacteria will soon become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an ever growing need to expedite the development of novel antimicrobials to combat these infections. Toward this end, we set out to refine an existing murine model of pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection to generate a robust preclinical tool that can be used to rapidly and accurately predict novel antimicrobial efficacy. This refinement was achieved by characterizing the virulence of a panel of genetically diverse MDR P. aeruginosa strains in this model, both by LD50 analysis and natural history studies. Further, we defined two antibiotic regimens (aztreonam and amikacin) that can be used a comparators during the future evaluation of novel antimicrobials, and validated that the model can effectively differentiate between successful and unsuccessful treatment as predicted by in vitro inhibitory data. This validated model represents an important tool in our arsenal to develop new therapies to combat MDR P. aeruginosa, with the ability to provide rapid preclinical evaluation of novel antimicrobials that can also serve to support data from clinical studies during the investigational drug development process.","Warawa, J.; Duan, X.; Anderson, C.; Sotsky, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,226176,Genomic diversity and molecular epidemiology of a multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa DMC30b isolated from hospitalized burn patient in Bangladesh,"ObjectivesPseudomonas aeruginosa is a key opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of community- and hospital-acquired infections in immunocompromised or catheterized patients. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of a multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa DMC30b in order to elucidate the genetic diversity, molecular epidemiology, and underlying mechanisms for antimicrobial resistance and virulence.

MethodsP. aeruginosa DMC30b was isolated from septic wound swab of a severe burn patient. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed under Ion Torrent platform. The genome was annotated using the SPAdes v. 3.12.01 in an integrated Genome Analysis Platform (IonGAP) for Ion Torrent sequence data. The genome was annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP). In-silico predictions of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor genes (VFGs) and metabolic functional potentials were performed using different curated bioinformatics tools.

ResultsP. aeruginosa DMC30b was classified as MDR and belongs to sequence type 244 (ST244). The complete genome size is 6,994,756 bp with a coverage of 76.76x, G+C content of 65.7% and a BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) score of 100. The genome of P. aeruginosa DMC30b harboured two plasmids (e,g., IncP-6 plasmid p10265-KPC; 78,007 bp and ColRNAI_pkOIISD1; 9,359 bp), 35 resistomes (ARGs) conferring resistance to 18 different antibiotics (including four beta-lactam classes), and 214 VFGs. It was identified as the 167th ST244 strain among [~] 5,800 whole-genome sequences of P. aeruginosa available in the NCBI database.

ConclusionP. aeruginosa DMC30b belongs to ST244 and was identified as the 167th such isolate to be submitted to NCBI, and the first complete ST244 genome from Bangladesh. The complete genome data with high genetic diversity and underlying mechanisms for antimicrobial resistance and virulence of P. aeruginosa DMC30b (ST244) will aid in understanding the evolution and phylogeny of such high-risk clones and provide a solid basis for further research on MDR or extensively drug resistant strains.","Hoque, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,226846,Bacterial pattern recognition in C. elegans by a nuclear hormone receptor,"Pattern recognition of bacterial products by host receptors is essential for innate immunity in many metazoans. Curiously, the nematode lineage lost canonical mechanisms of bacterial pattern recognition. Whether other immune receptors evolved in their place is not known. Here, we characterize the first bacterial pattern recognition receptor and its natural ligand in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the C. elegans nuclear hormone receptor NHR-86/HNF4 senses phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN), a metabolite produced by pathogenic strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PCN binds to the ligand-binding domain of NHR-86/HNF4, a ligand-gated transcription factor, and activates an anti-pathogen transcriptional program in intestinal epithelial cells that provides protection against P. aeruginosa. These data de-orphan a nuclear hormone receptor and demonstrate that surveillance of metabolite signals from bacteria allows nematodes to identify virulent pathogens in their environment that are poised to cause disease.","Peterson, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,227598,"Antibiotic induced biofilm formations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3 are associated with increased production of eDNA and exoproteins, increased ROS generation, and increased cell surface hydrophobicity","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a medically important bacteria due to its ability to form biofilm and is also an opportunistic pathogen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the intrinsic ability to form biofilm as one of the defense mechanisms for their survival. The fact that it can form biofilms on various medical implants makes it more harmful clinically. Although various antibiotics are used to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, previous studies have shown that sub-MIC levels of antibiotics cause biofilm formation in this type of bacteria. The present study thus deals with the effect of the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin on the biofilm dynamics of two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3. Biofilm formation was seen to be increasing with increased gentamicin concentrations in growth media. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy accompanied with other biochemical tests deduced that biofilm-forming components like exoproteins, eDNA, and exolipids as exopolymeric substances in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were increased in the presence of gentamicin. An increase in reactive oxygen species generation along with increased cell surface hydrophobicity was also seen in both strains when treated with gentamicin. The observed increase in the adherence of the cells accompanied by an increase in exopolymeric substances, eDNA, and exolipids may have largely contributed to the increased biofilm production by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains KPW.1-S1 and HRW.1-S3 under the stress of the antibiotic treatment.","Kumar, A.; Saha, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,227878,Emergence of Small Colony Variants (SCVs) is an adaptive strategy used by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to palliate O2 limitations,"The ability to generate a subpopulation of Small Colony Variants (SCVs) is a conserved feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and could represent a key adaptive strategy to colonize and persist in multiple niches. However, very little is known about the role of the SCV phenotype, the conditions that promote its emergence and its possible involvement in an adaptive strategy. In the present work, we investigated the in vitro selective conditions promoting the emergence of SCVs from the prototypical strain PA14, which readily forms SCVs in non-agitated standing cultures. We found that O2 limitations, which cause a redox imbalance, is the main factor selecting for the SCV phenotype, which promotes survival of the population via formation of a biofilm at the air-liquid interface to access the electron acceptor. When this selective pressure is relieved by aeration or supplementation of an alternative electron acceptor, SCVs are barely detectable. We also observed that SCV emergence contributes to redox rebalancing, suggesting that it is involved in an adaptive strategy. We conclude that selection for the SCV phenotype is an adaptive solution adopted by P. aeruginosa to access poorly available O2.

IMPORTANCEThe bacterium P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in many environments. It poses a significant health concern, notably because it is a causative agent of nosocomial infections and the most prevalent pathogen found in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. In infected hosts, its persistence is often related to the emergence of an alternative phenotype known as Small Colony Variant (SCV). Identification of conditions selecting for the SCV phenotype contributes to knowledge regarding adaptive mechanisms exploited by P. aeruginosa to survive in multiple niches and persist during infections. Hindering this adaptation strategy could help control P. aeruginosa persistent infections.","Besse, A.; Groleau, M.-C.; Deziel, E.",2022-07-22,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.07.20.500912,1,Eric Déziel,INRS-Armand-Frappier Santé Biotechnologie,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500912v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500912v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,228812,Pharmacodynamic model of the dynamic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to drug treatments,"Chronic infection by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients in whom overabundant mucus and the formation of bacterial biofilms pose barriers to drug delivery and effectiveness. Accurate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models of biofilm treatment could be used to guide formulation and administration strategies to better control bacterial lung infections. To this end, we have developed a detailed pharmacodynamic model of P. aeruginosa treatment with the front-line antibiotics, tobramycin and colistin, and validated it on a detailed dataset of killing dynamics. A compartmental model structure was developed in which the key features are diffusion of drug through a boundary layer to the bacteria, concentration dependent interactions with bacteria, and passage of the bacteria through successive transit states before death. The number of transit states employed was greater for tobramycin, which is a ribosomal inhibitor, than for colistin, which disrupts bacterial membranes. For both drugs, the experimentally observed delay in killing of bacteria following drug exposure was replicated and was consistent with the diffusion time, though for tobramycin, there was an additional delay reflected in the model by passage through the transit states. For each drug, the PD model with a single set of parameters described data across a ten-fold range of concentrations and for both continuous and transient exposure protocols. Furthermore, the parameters fit for each drug individually were used to model the response of biofilms to combined treatment with tobramycin and colistin. The ability to predict drug response over a range of administration protocols allows this PD model to be integrated with PK descriptions to describe in vivo antibiotic response dynamics and to predict drug delivery strategies for improved control of bacterial lung infections.

Author SummaryBiofilms are self-assembling bacterial communities that adhere to a surface and encase themselves in a protective coating. Biofilm infections are notoriously difficult to treat with conventional antibiotic administrations. To understand better the dynamics of bacterial biofilm killing in response to antibiotic treatment, we developed a mathematical model that integrates several features: drug diffusion through a boundary layer that includes the biofilm casing, concentration dependent cell damage, and passage of the cell through damaged states to eventual death. We validated the model by comparison with an extensive published dataset of biofilm response to treatment with the antibiotics, tobramycin and colistin. The model fits to these datasets were able to capture the observed trends for several antibiotic administration protocols, with model parameters reflecting the differences in mechanism of action between the two drugs.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,228935,Discovery of unknown quorum-sensing reprogramming factors in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a dual-acting-gene-blocking approach,"LasR-null, QS-active mutants commonly appear in Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) lung patients. However, underlying QS-reprogramming factors in CF isolates have yet to be uncovered. Here, we developed an unconventional screening approach, named dual-acting-gene-blocking (DAGB), to identify unknown QS-reprogramming determinants. Mutations in mexT have been linked to QS-reprogramming in the laboratory PAO1 LasR-null mutant. To block the inactivation of MexT, we engineered a recombinant LasR-null strain by introducing another copy of wild-type mexT into the neutral site of the genome. This strategy presumably ensures at least one copy of mexT is functioning if another one is inactive during the QS-required evolution, which thus blocks the inactivating MexT-mediated QS activation. Using DAGB, we identified a point mutation in rpoA (T262->A, RpoA*), encoding the -subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP), which could rewire QS activity in the LasR-null background. Like the MexT mutant, RpoA* also activated QS by suppressing the expression of the MexEF-OprN efflux pump. In contrast to the MexT mutant, RpoA* caused milder repression of the MexEF-OprN pump, resulting in an intermediate QS-active phenotype and a slower decline rate of growth fitness when treated with chloramphenicol. With iterative applications of the DAGB-based approach, we further discovered other non-mexT determinants capable of rewiring QS. Our study first reports non-MexT QS-reprogramming regulators in the LasR-null mutant, shedding light on understanding the QS activation mechanism in those P. aeruginosa LasR-null, QS-active clinical isolates. Our findings demonstrate that DAGB is a productive avenue to rapidly identify unknown genetic determinants in P. aeruginosa. Most importantly, the established DAGB-based framework is generalizable and could potentially be extended to uncover untapped pathways in other research areas as well as other organisms.","Cai, W.; Liao, H.; Lu, M.; Zhou, X.; Cheng, X.; Dai, W.",2022-08-01,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.08.01.502315,1,Weijun Dai,South China Agricultural University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.502315v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.01.502315v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,229817,Optical O2 sensors also respond to redox active molecules commonly secreted by bacteria,"From a metabolic perspective, molecular oxygen (O2) is arguably the most significant constituent of Earths atmosphere. Nearly every facet of microbial physiology is sensitive to the presence and concentration of O2, which is the most favorable terminal electron acceptor used by biological organisms and also a dangerously reactive oxidant. As O2 has such sweeping implications for physiology, researchers have developed diverse approaches to measure O2 concentrations in natural and laboratory settings. Recent improvements to phosphorescent O2 sensors piqued our interest due to the promise of optical measurement of spatiotemporal O2 dynamics. However, we found that our preferred bacterial model, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, secretes more than one molecule that quenches such sensors, complicating O2 measurements in PA14 cultures and biofilms. Assaying supernatants from cultures of 9 bacterial species demonstrated that this phenotype is common: all supernatants quenched a soluble O2 probe substantially. Phosphorescent O2 probes are often embedded in solid support for protection, but an embedded probe called O2NS was quenched by most supernatants as well. Measurements using pure compounds indicated that quenching is due to interactions with redox-active small molecules including phenazines and flavins. Uncharged and weakly-polar molecules like pyocyanin were especially potent quenchers of O2NS. These findings underscore that optical O2 measurements made in the presence of bacteria should be carefully controlled to ensure that O2, and not bacterial secretions, is measured, and motivate the design of custom O2 probes for specific organisms to circumvent sensitivity to redox-active metabolites.

ImportanceWhen they are closely-packed, as in biofilms, colonies, and soils, microbes can consume O2 faster than it diffuses. As such, O2 concentrations in natural environments can vary greatly over time and space, even on the micrometer scale. Wetting soil, for example, slows O2 diffusion higher in the soil column, which, in concert with microbial respiration, greatly diminishes [O2] at depth. Given that variation in [O2] has outsized implications for microbial physiology, there is great interest in measuring the dynamics of [O2] in microbial cultures and biofilms. We demonstrate that certain classes of bacterial metabolites frustrate optical measurement of [O2] with phosphorescent sensors, but also that some species (e.g. E. coli) do not produce problematic secretions under the conditions tested. Our work therefore offers a strategy for identifying organisms and culture conditions in which optical quantification of spatiotemporal [O2] dynamics with current sensors is feasible.","Flamholz, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,230048,Targeting the Search: An Upgraded Structural and Functional Repository of Antimicrobial Peptides for Biofilm Studies (B-AMP v2.0) with a Focus on Biofilm Protein Targets,"Bacterial biofilms, often as multispecies communities, are recalcitrant to conventional antibiotics, making the treatment of biofilm infections a challenge. There is a push towards developing novel anti-biofilm approaches, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), with activity against specific biofilm targets. In previous work, we developed Biofilm-AMP, a structural and functional repository of AMPs for biofilm studies (B-AMP v1.0) with more than 5000 structural models of AMPs and a vast library of AMP annotations to existing biofilm literature. In this study, we present an upgraded version of B-AMP, with a focus on existing and novel bacterial biofilm targets. B-AMP v2.0 hosts a curated collection of 2502 biofilm protein targets across 473 bacterial species, with structural protein models and functional annotations from PDB, UniProt, and PubMed databases. The biofilm targets can be searched for using the name of the source organism, and function and type of protein, and results include designated Target IDs (unique to B-AMP v2.0), UniProt IDs, 3D predicted protein structures, PDBQT files, pre-defined protein function, and relevant scientific literature. To present an example of the combined applicability of both, the AMP and biofilm target libraries in the repository, we present two case studies. In the first case study, we expand an in silico pipeline to evaluate AMPs against a single biofilm target in the multidrug resistant, bacterial pathogen Corynebacterium striatum, using 3D protein-peptide docking models from previous work and Molecular Dynamics simulations ([~]1.18 {micro}s). In the second case study, we build an in silico pipeline to identify candidate AMPs (using AMPs with both anti-Gram positive and anti-Gram negative activity) against two biofilm targets with a common functional classification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, widely-encountered bacterial co-pathogens. With its enhanced structural and functional capabilities, B-AMP v2.0 serves as a comprehensive resource for AMP investigations related to biofilm studies. B-AMP v2.0 is freely available at https://b-amp.karishmakaushiklab.com and will be regularly updated with structural models of AMPs and biofilm targets, as well as 3D protein-peptide interaction models for key biofilm-forming pathogens.","Ravichandran, S.; Sai Supriya Avatapalli, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,230080,Polynuclear ruthenium complexes are effective antibiotics against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"There is an urgent need to develop new antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In particular, new and diverse chemical classes of antibiotics are needed, as most antibiotics in clinical development are derivatives of existing drugs. Despite a history of use as antimicrobials, metals and metal-based compounds have largely been overlooked as a source of new chemical matter for antibacterial drug discovery. In this work, we identify several ruthenium complexes, ruthenium red, Ru265, and Ru360, that possess potent antibacterial activity against both laboratory and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Suppressors with increased resistance were sequenced and found to contain mutations in the mechanosensitive ion channel mscS-1 or the colRS two component system. The antibacterial activity of these compounds translated in vivo to Galleria mellonella larvae and mouse infection models. Finally, we identify strong synergy between these compounds and the antibiotic rifampicin, with a dose-sparing combination therapy showing efficacy in both infection models. Our findings provide clear evidence that these ruthenium complexes are effective antibacterial compounds against a critical priority pathogen and show promise for the development of future therapeutics.","Weber, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,230086,Accumulation of defense systems drives panphage resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Prokaryotes carry multiple distinct anti-viral defense systems. However, the impact of carrying a multitude of defense systems on virus resistance remains unclear, especially in a clinical context. Using a collection of antibiotic-resistant clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a broad panel of phages, we demonstrate that intracellular defense systems are major determinants of phage host range and that overall phage resistance scales with the number of defense systems in the bacterial genome. We show that individual defense systems are specific to certain phage types, including Jumbo phages, and that the accumulation of defense systems with distinct specificities results in panphage resistant phenotypes. Accumulation of defense systems is aided by their localization within mobile phage defense elements facilitating horizontal gene transfer. Overall, we show that panphage resistant, defense-accumulating strains of P. aeruginosa with up to 19 phage defense systems already occur in the clinic, which may impact the development of phage-based therapeutics.","Costa, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,230817,Phage-antibiotic combinations to control Pseudomonas aeruginosa-Candida two-species biofilms,"Phage-antibiotic combinations to treat bacterial infections are gaining increased attention due to the synergistic effects often observed when applying both components together. This synergy has also been observed for bacteria embedded in biofilms as many phages are capable of degrading the heterogeneous material, often preventing antibiotic compounds from reaching the embedded bacteria. Most studies however focus on a single pathogen, although in many clinical cases multiple species are present at the site of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-biofilm activity of phage-antibiotic/antifungal combinations on single- and dual-species biofilms formed by the bacterium P. aeruginosa and the fungal pathogen Candida albicans, two microorganisms commonly found together in cystic fibrosis patients. The Pseudomonas phage Motto in combination with ciprofloxacin had significant anti-biofilm activity in disintegrating 24-hour-old pseudomonal biofilms. Also, other antibiotic combinations, such as cefotaxime, gentamicin, meropenem and tetracycline showed substantial effects on biofilms. We then compared biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa alone with the dual-species biofilms formed by bacteria and C. albicans. Here, we found that the phage together with the antifungal fluconazole was active against 6-hour-old dual-species biofilms but showed only negligible activity against 24-hour-old biofilms. Similarly, the combination of antibacterial compounds together with the phage showed no synergistic effects on biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. This study lays the first foundation for potential therapeutic approaches to treat infections caused by bacteria and fungi using phage-antibiotic combinations.","Manohar, P.; Loh, B.; Nachimuthu, R.; Leptihn, S.",2022-08-19,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.08.18.504394,1,Sebastian Leptihn,Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.18.504394v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.18.504394v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,230927,"Function and structure of FlaK, a master regulator of the polar flagellar genes in marine Vibrio","Vibrio alginolyticus has a flagellum at the cell pole, and the fla genes, involved in its formation, are hierarchically regulated in several classes. FlaK (also called FlrA) is an ortholog of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FleQ, an AAA+ ATPase that functions as a master regulator for all later fla genes. In this study, we conducted mutational analysis of FlaK to examine its ATPase activity, ability to form a multimeric structure, and function in flagellation. We cloned flaK and confirmed that its deletion caused a non-flagellated phenotype. We substituted amino acids at the ATP binding/hydrolysis site and performed putative subunit interfaces in a multimeric structure. Mutations in the aforementioned sites abolished both ATPase activity and the ability of FlaK to induce downstream flagellar gene expression. The L371E mutation, at the putative subunit interface, abolished flagellar gene expression but retained ATPase activity, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is not sufficient for flagellar gene expression. We also found that FlhG, a negative flagellar biogenesis regulator, suppressed the ATPase activity of FlaK. The 20 FlhG C-terminal residues are critical for reducing FlaK ATPase activity. Chemical crosslinking and size exclusion chromatography revealed that FlaK mostly exists as a dimer in solution and can form multimers, independent of ATP. However, ATP induced the interaction between FlhG and FlaK to form a large complex. The in vivo effects of FlhG on FlaK, such as multimer formation and/or DNA binding, are important for gene regulation.

IMPORTANCEFlaK is an NtrC-type activator of the AAA+ ATPase subfamily of {sigma}54-dependent promoters of flagellar genes. FlhG, a MinD-like ATPase, negatively regulates the polar flagellar number by collaborating with FlhF, an FtsY-like GTPase. We found that FlaK and FlhG interact in the presence of ATP, to form a large complex. Mutational analysis revealed the importance of FlaK ATPase activity in flagellar gene expression and provided a model of the Vibrio molecular mechanism that regulates the flagellar number.","Homma, M.; Kobayakawa, T.; Hao, Y.; Nishikino, T.; Kojima, S.",2022-08-20,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.08.19.504623,1,Michio Homma,Nagoya University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.19.504623v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.19.504623v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,231225,CasDinG is an ATP-dependent 5'-3' DNA helicase with accessory domains essential for type IV CRISPR immunity,"CRISPR-associated DinG protein (CasDinG) is essential to type IV-A CRISPR function. However, the enzymatic activities of CasDinG are unknown. Here we demonstrate that CasDinG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 83 is an ATP- and metal-dependent 5-3 DNA helicase. The crystal structure of CasDinG reveals a helicase core of two RecA-like domains with three accessory domains (N-terminal, arch, and vestigial FeS). To examine the in vivo function of these CasDinG domains, we first identified the preferred PAM sequence (5-GNAWN-3 on the 5-side of the target) with a plasmid library containing all combinations of the five nucleotides upstream of the target sequence. Plasmid clearance assays (using a 5-GGAAA-3 PAM) with CasDinG domain mutants demonstrated the vFeS and arch accessory domains are both essential for type IV immunity. These results provide a needed structural and biochemical framework for understanding the type IV-A CRISPR system.","Domgaard, H.; Cahoon, C. D.; Armbrust, M.; Redman, O.; Thomas, A.; Jackson, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,231414,Systems-wide dissection of organic acid assimilation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals a novel path to underground metabolism,"The human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is one of the most frequent and severe causes of nosocomial infection. This organism is also a major cause of airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Pa is known to have a remarkable metabolic plasticity, allowing it to thrive in diverse environmental conditions and ecological niches, yet little is known about the central metabolic pathways which sustain its growth during infection, or precisely how these pathways operate. In this work, we used a combination of  omics approaches (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and 13C-fluxomics) and reverse genetics to provide a systems-level insight into how the infection-relevant organic acids, succinate and propionate, are metabolized by Pa. Moreover, through structural and kinetic analysis of the 2-methylcitrate synthase (PrpC) and its paralogue, citrate synthase (GltA), we show how these two crucial enzymatic steps are interconnected in Pa organic acid assimilation. We found that Pa can rapidly adapt to the loss of GltA function by acquiring mutations in a transcriptional repressor, which then de-represses prpC expression. Our findings provide a clear example of how  underground metabolism, facilitated by enzyme substrate promiscuity, ""rewires"" Pa metabolism, allowing it to overcome the loss of a crucial enzyme. This pathogen-specific knowledge is critical for the advancement of a model-driven framework to target bacterial central metabolism.","Dolan, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,231937,Transcriptomics-driven characterisation of novel T7-like temperate Pseudomonas phage LUZ100,"The Autographiviridae is a diverse yet distinct family of bacterial viruses marked by a strictly lytic lifestyle and a generally conserved genome organization. We here characterise Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ100, a distant relative of type phage T7. LUZ100 is a podovirus with a limited host range and identified LPS as the likely phage receptor. Interestingly, infection dynamics of LUZ100 indicated moderate adsorption rates and low virulence, hinting towards temperate behavior. This hypothesis was supported by genomic analysis, which showed that LUZ100 shares the conventional T7-like genome organization, yet encodes key genes associated with a temperate lifestyle. To unravel the peculiar characteristics of LUZ100, ONT-cappable-seq transcriptomics analysis was performed. This data generated a birds-eye view of the LUZ100 transcriptome and enabled the discovery of key regulatory elements, antisense RNA, and transcriptional unit structures. The transcriptional map of LUZ100 also allowed us to identify new RNAP-promoter pairs that can form the basis for biotechnological parts and tools for new synthetic transcription regulation circuitry. The ONT-cappable-seq data revealed that the LUZ100 integrase and a MarR-like regulator (proposed to be involved in the lytic/lysogeny decision), are actively co-transcribed in an operon. In addition, the presence of a phage-specific promoter transcribing the phage-encoded RNA polymerase, raises questions on the regulation of this polymerase, and suggests it is interwoven with the MarR-based regulation. This transcriptomics-driven characterisation of LUZ100 supports the increasing evidence that T7-like phages should not straightforwardly be marked as having a strictly lytic lifecycle.

ImportanceBacteriophage T7, considered the  model phage of the Autographiviridae family, is marked by a strictly lytic lifecycle and conserved genome organisation. Recently, novel phages of this clade are emerging and showing characteristics associated to a lysogenic lifecycle. Screening for temperate behaviour is of outmost importance in fields like phage therapy, where strictly lytic phages are generally required for therapeutic applications. In this study, weve used an omics-driven approach to characterise the T7-like Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ100. These results led to the identification of actively transcribed lysogeny-associated genes in the phage genome, pointing out that temperate T7-like phages are emerging more frequent than initially thought. In short, the combination of genomics and transcriptomics allowed us to obtain a better understanding of the biology of non-model Autographiviridae phages, which can be used to optimize the implementation of phages and their regulatory elements in phage therapy and biotechnological applications, respectively.","Putzeys, L.; Poppeliers, J.; Boon, M.; Lood, C.; Vallino, M.; Lavigne, R.",2022-08-30,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.08.29.505779,1,Rob Lavigne,KU Leuven,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.29.505779v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.08.29.505779v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA

Here, we introduce a highly-selective protein delivery platform, termed DUEC, which responds to direct contact of attacking cells by engineering the tit-for-tat/dueling response of H1-T6SS (type VI secretion system) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using a Cre-recombinase-dependent reporter, we screened H1-T6SS secreted substrates and developed Tse6N as the most effective secretion tag for Cre delivery. DUEC cells can discriminately deliver the Tse6N-Cre cargo into the cytosol of T6SS+ but not T6SS- Vibrio cholerae cells in a mixed population. These data demonstrate that the DUEC cell is not only a prototypical physical-contact sensor and delivery platform but also may be coupled with recombination-based circuits with the potential for complex tasks in mixed microbial communities.","Dong, T.; Wu, L.-L.; Yan, S.; Pei, T.-T.; Tang, M.-X.; Li, H.; Liang, X.; Sun, S.",2022-09-02,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.02.506313,1,Tao Dong,Southern University of Science and Technology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.02.506313v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.02.506313v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,232275,Machine learning identification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from colony image data,"When grown on agar surfaces, microbes can produce distinct multicellular spatial structures called colonies, which contain characteristic sizes, shapes, edges, textures, and degrees of opacity and color. For over one hundred years, researchers have used these morphology cues to classify bacteria and guide more targeted treatment of pathogens. Advances in genome sequencing technology have revolutionized our ability to classify bacterial isolates and while genomic methods are in the ascendancy, morphological characterization of bacterial species has made a resurgence due to increased computing capacities and widespread application of machine learning tools. In this paper, we revisit the topic of colony morphotype on the within-species scale and apply concepts from image processing, computer vision, and deep learning to a dataset of 69 environmental and clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. We find that colony morphology and complexity under common laboratory conditions is a robust, repeatable phenotype on the level of individual strains, and therefore forms a potential basis for strain classification. We then use a deep convolutional neural network approach with a combination of data augmentation and transfer learning to overcome the typical data starvation problem in biological applications of deep learning and achieve a validation accuracy averaging above 94% for the classification of individual strains. These results indicate that bacterial strains have characteristic visual fingerprints that can serve as the basis of classification on a sub-species level. Our work illustrates the potential of image-based classification of bacterial pathogens and highlights the potential to use similar approaches to predict medically relevant strain characteristics like antibiotic resistance and virulence from colony data.

Author SummarySince the birth of microbiology, scientists have looked at the patterns of bacterial growth on agar (colony morphology) as a key tool for identifying bacterial species. We return to this traditional approach with modern tools of computer vision and deep learning and show that we can achieve high levels of classification accuracy (94%) on a within-species scale, despite what is considered a  data-starved dataset. Our results show that strains of the environmental generalist and opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa have a characteristic morphological  fingerprint that enables accurate strain classification via a custom deep convolutional neural network. Our work points to extensions towards predicting phenotypes of interest (e.g. antibiotic resistance, virulence), and suggests that sample size limitations may be less restrictive than previously thought for deep learning applications in biology, given appropriate use of data augmentation and transfer-learning tools.","Rattray, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,232611,Dual control of lysogeny and phage defense by a phosphorylation-based toxin/antitoxin system,"Regulatory systems that maintain prophage quiescence integrate phage and host gene expression with environmental conditions1,2. In the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pf filamentous bacteriophages play critical roles in biofilm formation and virulence3-5, but mechanisms governing Pf prophage activation in biofilms are largely unknown. Here, we report a new type of prophage regulatory module in a widely-distributed P. aeruginosa lineage that not only controls virion production of co-resident Pf prophages, but also mediates defense against diverse lytic phages. By comparing two lineages of the prototype P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 that harbor different Pf prophages, we identified a prophage-encoded kinase-kinase-phosphatase (KKP) system that controls Pf production in biofilms. KKP components exhibit dynamic stoichiometry, where high kinase levels in planktonic conditions maintain phosphorylation of the host H-NS protein MvaU, repressing prophage activation. During biofilm formation, phosphatase expression is heightened, leading to MvaU dephosphorylation and alleviating repression of prophage gene expression. KKP clusters are present in hundreds of diverse temperate prophages and other mobile elements across Gram-negative bacteria. Characterization of KKP modules from different species revealed that, in addition to regulating Pf phage lysogeny, KKP functions as a tripartite toxin-antitoxin system that mediates host defense from predatory lytic phages. KKP represents a new phosphorylation-based mechanism for prophage regulation and for phage defense. The dual function of this module raises the question of whether other newly described phage defense systems6-9 also regulate intrinsic prophage biology in diverse hosts.","Guo, Y.; Tang, K.; Sit, B.; Gu, J.; Chen, R.; Lin, J.; Lin, S.; Liu, X.; Wang, W.; Gao, X.; Nie, Z.; Liu, T.; Waldor, M.

If a metabolite is bioactive, even at sub-lethal levels, and also stable in the environment, then it could provide selection pressure for resistance. (5S)-penicilloic acid of piperacillin has previously been found complexed to the binding pocket of penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we predicted the affinities of all potentially relevant antibiotic metabolites of ten different penicillins to that target protein, using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Docking predicts that, in addition to penicilloic acid, pseudopenicillin derivatives of these penicillins, as well as 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6APA), could also bind to this target. Molecular dynamics simulations further confirmed that (5R)-pseudopenicillin and 6APA bind the target protein, in addition to (5S)-penicilloic acid. Thus, it is possible that these metabolites are bioactive, and, if stable in the environment, could be contaminants selective for antibiotic resistance. This could have considerable significance for environmental surveillance for antibiotics as a means to reduce antimicrobial resistance, because targeted mass spectrometry could be required for relevant metabolites as well as the native antibiotics.","Chio, H.; Guest, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,232824,Antibiotics that affect translation can antagonize phage infectivity by interfering with the deployment of counter-defences.,"It is becoming increasingly clear that antibiotics can both positively and negatively impact the infectivity of bacteriophages (phage), but the underlying mechanisms often remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that antibiotics that target the protein translation machinery can fundamentally alter the outcome of bacteria-phage interactions by interfering with the production of phage-encoded counter-defence proteins. Specifically, using Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and phage DMS3vir as a model, we show that bacteria with CRISPR-Cas immune systems have elevated levels of immunity against phage that encode anti-CRISPR (acr) genes when translation inhibitors are present in the environment. CRISPR-Cas are highly prevalent defence systems that enable bacteria to detect and destroy phage genomes in a sequence-specific manner. In response, many phages encode acr genes that are expressed immediately following infection to inhibit key steps of the CRISPR-Cas immune response. Our data show that while phage carrying acr genes can amplify efficiently on bacteria with CRISPR-Cas immune systems in the absence of antibiotics, the presence of antibiotics that act on protein translation prevents phage amplification, while protecting bacteria from lysis. These results help to understand how antibiotics-phage synergy and antagonism depend on the molecular interactions that define phage infectivity and host immunity.","Pons, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,232823,Fluid flow sensitizes bacterial pathogens to chemical stress,"Cells regularly experience fluid flow in natural systems. However, most experimental systems rely on batch cell culture and fail to consider the effect of flow-driven dynamics on cell physiology. Using microfluidics and single-cell imaging, we discover that the interplay of physical shear rate (a measure of fluid flow) and chemical stress trigger a transcriptional response in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In batch cell culture, cells protect themselves by quickly scavenging the ubiquitous chemical stressor hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from the media. In microfluidic conditions, we observe that cell scavenging generates spatial gradients of H2O2. High shear rates replenish H2O2, abolish gradients, and generate a stress response. Combining mathematical simulations and biophysical experiments, we find that cells in flow are sensitive to a H2O2 concentration that is 100-1000 times lower than traditionally studied in batch cell culture. Surprisingly, the shear rate and H2O2 concentration required to trigger a transcriptional response closely match their respective values in the human bloodstream. Thus, our results explain a long-standing discrepancy between H2O2 levels in experimental and natural systems. Finally, we demonstrate that the shear rate and H2O2 concentration found in the human bloodstream trigger gene expression in the blood-relevant human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, suggesting that flow sensitizes bacteria to chemical stress in natural environments.","Padron, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233345,The dynamic response of quorum-sensing to density is robust to signal supplementation and signal synthase knockouts,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a widespread mechanism of environment sensing and behavioral coordination in bacteria. At its core, QS is based on the production, sensing and response to small signaling molecules. Previous work with Pseudomonas aeruginosa shows that QS can be used to achieve quantitative resolution and deliver a dosed response to the bacterias density environment, implying a sophisticated mechanism of control. To shed light on how the mechanistic signal components contribute to graded responses to density, we assess the impact of genetic (AHL signal synthase deletion) and/or signal supplementation (exogenous AHL and PQS addition) perturbations on lasB reaction-norms to changes in density. Our approach condenses data from 2,000 timeseries (over 74,000 individual observations) into a comprehensive view of QS-controlled gene expression across variation in genetic, environmental, and signal determinants of lasB expression. We first confirm that deleting either ({Delta}lasI, {Delta}rhlI) or both ({Delta}lasIrhlI) signal synthase genes attenuates QS response. In the {Delta}rhlI background we show persistent yet attenuated density-dependent lasB expression due to native 3-oxo-C12 signaling. We then test if density-independent quantities of signal (3-oxo-C12, C4, PQS or combined) added to the WT either flatten or increase the reaction norm and find that the WT response is robust to all tested concentrations of signal, alone or in combination. We then move to progressively supplementing the genetic knockouts and find that cognate signal supplementation ({Delta}lasI+3-oxo-C12, {Delta}rhlI+C4) is sufficient to restore lasB expression and as well as reactivity to density encoded by the intact signal synthase. We also find that dual supplementation of the double synthase knockout restores expression but does not flatten the reaction norm. Despite adding a density-independent amount of AHL, the double signal synthase can still quantitively sense density. Our results show that a positive reaction norm to density is robust to multiple combinations of gene deletion and density-independent signal supplementation and that while density-independent signal supplementation can increase mean expression, the WT QS still retains the ability to quantitatively respond to density. Our work develops a modular approach to query the robustness and mechanistic bases of the central environmental sensing phenotype of quorum sensing.","Rattray, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233519,Paecilomycone inhibits quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes major healthcare concerns due to its virulence and high intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, new treatments are highly needed. An interesting approach is to target quorum sensing (QS). QS regulates the production of a wide variety of virulence factors and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. This study describes the identification of paecilomycone as inhibitor of QS in both C. violaceum and P. aeruginosa. Paecilomycone strongly inhibited the production of virulence factors, including various phenazines, and biofilm formation. In search of the working mechanism, we found that paecilomycone inhibited the production of 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) and 3,4- dihydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (PQS), but not 2-aminoacetophenone (2-AA). We suggest that paecilomycone affects QS in P. aeruginosa by targeting the PqsBC complex and alternative targets, or alters processes that influence the enzymatic activity of the PqsBC complex. The toxicity of paecilomycone towards eukaryotic cells and organisms was low, making it an interesting lead for further clinical research.

ImportanceAntibiotics are becoming less effective against bacterial infections due to the evolution of resistance among bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen that causes major healthcare concerns and is difficult to treat due to its high intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents. Therefore, new targets are needed and an interesting approach is to target quorum sensing (QS). QS is the communication system in bacteria that regulates multiple pathways including the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation, which leads to high toxicity in the host and low sensitivity to antibiotics, respectively. We found a compound, named paecilomycone, which inhibited biofilm formation and the production of various virulence factors in P. aeruginosa. The toxicity of paecilomycone towards eukaryotic cells and organisms was low, making it an interesting lead for further clinical research.","Beenker, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233502,The role of evolutionarily metastable oligomeric states in the optimization of catalytic activity,"The emergence of oligomers is common during the evolution and diversification of protein families, yet the selective advantage of oligomerization is often cryptic or unclear. Oligomerization can involve the formation of isologous head-to-head interfaces (e.g., in symmetrical dimers) or heterologous head-to-tail interfaces (e.g., in cyclic complexes), the latter of which is less well studied and understood. In this work, we retrace the emergence of the trimeric form of cyclohexadienyl dehydratase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PaCDT) by introducing residues that form the PaCDT trimer-interface into AncCDT-5 (a monomeric reconstructed ancestor of PaCDT). We find that single interface mutations can switch the oligomeric state of the variants (implying evolutionarily metastable oligomeric states) and that trimerization corresponds with a reduction in the KM value of the enzyme from a promiscuous level to the physiologically relevant range. We show that this can be rationalized at the structural and dynamic level by reduced sampling of a non-catalytic conformational substate, and that trimerization was likely followed by a C-terminal extension that further refined the conformational sampling and kinetic properties of the enzyme. This work provides insight into how neutral sampling of metastable oligomeric states along an evolutionary trajectory can facilitate the evolution and optimization of enzyme function.

Importance & Impact StatementUnderstanding how and why structural complexity (including homo-oligomerization and sequence insertions) emerges during the evolution and diversification of natural enzymes is a key goal in the study and design of protein function. We show that cyclic homo-oligomeric states can emerge via a small number of substitutions, and that trimerization and a C-terminal extension contributed to the tuning of catalytic properties during the evolution of cyclohexadienyl dehydratase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","East, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233589,Interactions between metabolism and growth can determine the co-existence of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Most bacteria exist and interact within polymicrobial communities. These interactions produce unique compounds, increased virulence and augmented antibiotic resistance. One community associated with negative healthcare outcomes consists of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. When co-cultured, virulence factors secreted by P. aeruginosa reduce metabolism and growth in S. aureus. When grown in vitro this allows P. aeruginosa to drive S. aureus towards extinction. However, when found in vivo, both species can co-exist. Previous work has noted that this may due to altered gene expression or mutations. However, little is known about how the growth environment could influence co-existence of both species. Using a combination of mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that changes to bacterial growth and metabolism caused by differences in the growth environment can determine final population composition. We found that changing the carbon source in growth medium affects the ratio of ATP to growth rate for both species, a metric we call absolute growth. We found that as a growth environment increases absolute growth for one species, that species will dominate the co-culture. This is due to interactions between growth, metabolism and metabolism altering virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa. Finally, we show that the relationship between absolute growth and final population composition can be perturbed by altering the spatial structure in the community. Our results demonstrate that differences in growth environment can account for conflicting observations regarding the co-existence of these bacterial species in the literature, and may offer a novel mechanism to manipulate polymicrobial populations.","Pajon, C.; Fortoul, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233582,Systematic mutagenesis reveals critical effector functions in the assembly and dueling of the H1-T6SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen that can cause severe wound and lung infections. It employs the type VI secretion system (H1-T6SS) as a molecular weapon to carry out a unique dueling response to deliver toxic effectors to neighboring sister cells or other microbes after sensing an external attack. However, the underlying mechanism for such dueling is not fully understood. Here, we examined the role of all H1-T6SS effectors and VgrG proteins in assembly and signal sensing by ectopic expression, combinatorial deletion and point mutations, and imaging analyses. Expression of effectors targeting the cell wall and membrane resulted in increased H1-T6SS assembly. Deletion of individual effector and vgrG genes had minor- to-moderate effects on H1-T6SS assembly and dueling activities. The dueling response was detectable in the P. aeruginosa mutant lacking all H1-T6SS effector activities. In addition, double deletions of vgrG1a with either vgrG1b or vgrG1c and double deletions of effector genes tse5 and tse6 severely reduced T6SS assembly and dueling activities, suggesting their critical role in T6SS assembly. Collectively, these data highlight the diverse roles of effectors in not only dictating antibacterial functions but also their differential contributions to the assembly of the complex H1-T6SS apparatus.","Wu, L.-L.; Pei, T.-T.; Yan, S.; Tang, M.-X.; Wu, L.-W.; Li, H.; Liang, X.; Sun, S.; Dong, T.",2022-09-14,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.14.507963,1,Tao Dong,Southern University of Science and Technology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.14.507963v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.14.507963v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,233656,Gene amplifications cause high-level resistance against albicidin in Gram-negative bacteria,"Antibiotic resistance is a continuously increasing concern for public health care. Understanding resistance mechanisms and their emergence is crucial for the development of new antibiotics and their effective use. Here, we report the discovery of a gene amplification-based mechanism that imparts an up to 1000-fold increase in resistance levels against the antibiotic albicidin. We show that this mechanism protects Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli by increasing the copy number of the GyrI-like transcription regulator STM3175 (YgiV) which binds albicidin. X-ray crystallography and molecular docking studies reveal a conserved binding motif that can interact with aromatic building blocks of albicidin. Phylogenetic studies suggest that this resistance mechanism is ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria and our experiments confirm that STM3175 homologs can convey resistance in pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Saathoff, M.; Kosol, S.; Semmler, T.; Wolf, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234100,Electrochemical disruption of extracellular electron transfer inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa cell survival within biofilms and is synergistic with antibiotic treatment,"Survival of cells within oxygen-limited regions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms is enabled by using small redox active molecules as electron shuttles to access distal oxidants. This respiratory versatility makes P. aeruginosa biofilms common in chronic wound infections and recalcitrant to treatment. Here, we show that electrochemically controlling the redox state of these electron shuttles, specifically pyocyanin, can impact cell survival within anaerobic P. aeruginosa biofilms and can act synergistically with antibiotic treatment. We inhibited pyocyanin redox cycling under anoxic conditions by blocking its ability to be re-oxidized and thus serve as an electron shuttle via poising an electrode at a reductive potential that cannot regenerate oxidized pyocyanin (i.e. -400mV vs Ag/AgCl). This resulted in a decrease in CFUs within the biofilm of 100x compared to samples exposed to an electrode poised at an oxidizing potential that permits pyocyanin re-oxidation (i.e. +100mV vs Ag/AgCl). Phenazine-deficient {Delta}phz* biofilms were not affected by the redox potential of the electrode, but were re-sensitized by adding pyocyanin. The effect of EET disruption was exacerbated when biofilms were treated with sub-MICs of a range of antibiotics. Most notably, 4 g/ml of the aminoglycoside gentamicin in a reductive environment almost completely eradicated wild type biofilms but had no effect on the survival of {Delta}phz* biofilms, suggesting reduced phenazines are toxic, and combined with antibiotic treatment can lead to extensive killing.

ImportanceBiofilms provide a protective environment but they also present challenges to the cells living within them, such as overcoming diffusion limitation of nutrients and oxygen. Pseudomonas aeruginosa overcomes oxygen limitation by secreting soluble redox active molecules as electron shuttles to access distal oxygen. Here, we show that electrochemically blocking the redox cycling of one of these electron shuttles, pyocyanin, decreases cell survival within biofilms and acts synergistically with gentamicin to kill cells. Our results highlight the importance of the role that the redox cycling of electron shuttles fulfills within P. aeruginosa biofilms.","Jimenez Otero, F.; Newman, D. K.; Tender, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234059,A family of novel immune systems targets early infection of nucleus-forming jumbo phages,"Jumbo bacteriophages of the [ovbar]KZ-like family are characterized by large genomes (>200 kb) and the remarkable ability to assemble a proteinaceous nucleus-like structure. The nucleus protects the phage genome from canonical DNA-targeting immune systems, such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction-modification. We hypothesized that the failure of common bacterial defenses creates selective pressure for immune systems that target the unique jumbo phage biology. Here, we identify the ""jumbo phage killer"" (Juk) immune system that is deployed by a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to resist [ovbar]KZ. Juk immunity rescues the cell by preventing early phage transcription, DNA replication, and nucleus assembly. Phage infection is first sensed by JukA (formerly YaaW), which localizes rapidly to the site of phage infection at the cell pole, triggered by ejected phage factors. The effector protein JukB is recruited by JukA, which is required to enable immunity and the subsequent degradation of the phage DNA. JukA homologs are found in several bacterial phyla and are associated with numerous other putative effectors, many of which provided specific anti-[ovbar]KZ activity when expressed in P. aeruginosa. Together, these data reveal a novel strategy for immunity whereby immune factors are recruited to the site of phage protein and DNA ejection to prevent phage progression and save the cell.","Li, Y.; Guan, J.; Hareendranath, S.; Crawford, E.; Agard, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234329,The effect of metal remediation on the virulence and antimicrobial resistance of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Metal contamination poses both a direct threat to human health as well as an indirect threat through its potential to affect bacterial pathogens. Metals can not only co-select for antibiotic resistance, but also might affect pathogen virulence via increased siderophore production. Siderophores are extracellular compounds released to increase ferric iron uptake -- a common limiting factor for pathogen growth within hosts - making them an important virulence factor. However, siderophores can also be positively selected for to detoxify non-ferrous metals, and consequently metal stress can potentially increase bacterial virulence. Anthropogenic methods to remediate environmental metal contamination commonly involve amendment with lime-containing materials, but whether this reduces in situ co-selection for antibiotic resistance and virulence remains unknown. Here, using microcosms containing metal-contaminated river water and sediment, we experimentally test whether metal remediation by liming reduces co-selection for these traits in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa embedded within a natural microbial community. To test for the effects of environmental structure, which can impact siderophore production, microcosms were incubated under either static or shaking conditions. Evolved P. aeruginosa populations had greater fitness in the presence of toxic concentrations of copper than the ancestral strain, but this effect was reduced in the limed treatments. Evolved P. aeruginosa populations showed increased resistance to the clinically-relevant antibiotics apramycin, cefotaxime, and trimethoprim, regardless of lime addition or environmental structure. Although we found virulence to be significantly associated with siderophore production, neither virulence nor siderophore production significantly differed between the four treatments. We therefore demonstrate that although remediation via liming reduced the strength of selection for metal resistance mechanisms, it did not mitigate metal-imposed selection for antibiotic resistance or virulence in P. aeruginosa. Consequently, metal-contaminated environments may select for antibiotic resistance and virulence traits even when treated with lime.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234323,Pseudomonas aeruginosa FpvB is a high-affinity transporter for xenosiderophores ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B,"Iron is essential for many biological functions in bacteria but its poor solubility is a limiting factor for growth. Bacteria produce siderophores, soluble natural products that bind iron with high affinity, to overcome this challenge. Siderophore-iron complexes return to the cell through specific outer-membrane transporters. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa makes multiple transporters that recognize its own siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin, and xenosiderophores produced by other bacteria, which gives it a competitive advantage. Some antibiotics exploit these transporters to bypass the membrane to reach their intercellular targets - including the thiopeptide antibiotic, thiostrepton (TS), which uses the pyoverdine transporters FpvA and FpvB to cross the outer membrane. Here, we assessed TS susceptibility in the presence of various siderophores and discovered that ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B antagonized TS uptake via FpvB. Unexpectedly, we found that FpvB transports ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B with higher affinity than pyoverdine. Site-directed mutagenesis of FpvB coupled with competitive growth inhibition and affinity label quenching studies suggested that the siderophores and antibiotic share a common binding site in an aromatic pocket formed by the plug and barrel domains, but have differences in their binding mechanism and molecular determinants for uptake. This work describes an alternative uptake pathway for ferrichrome and ferrioxamine B in P. aeruginosa and emphasizes the promiscuity of siderophore transporters, with implications for Gram-negative antibiotic development via the Trojan horse approach.","Chan, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234342,Critical role of growth medium for detecting drug interactions in Gram-negative bacteria that model in vivo responses,"The rise in infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has necessitated a variety of clinical approaches, including the use of antibiotic combinations. Antibiotic susceptibility is affected in part by the growth state of bacteria within various tissues. Here we tested the hypothesis that drug-drug interactions vary in different media, and hence, using a medium that reflects tissue environments will better predict in vivo outcomes. We systematically studied pair-wise antibiotic interactions in three different media (CAMHB, a urine mimetic, and a lung mimetic) using three Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab), Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa). There were pronounced differences in responses to antibiotic combinations between the three bacterial species grown in the same medium. However, within species, Pa responded to drug combinations similarly when grown in all three different media, whereas Ab responded similarly when grown in CAMHB and a lung mimetic medium. By contrast, drug interactions in Kp were poorly correlated across three different media. To assess whether distinct media were predictive of antibiotic interactions in Kp in the lungs of mice, we developed a treatment strategy and tested three antibiotic combination pairs. Measurements obtained in vitro from lung mimetic medium, but not rich medium, predicted in vivo outcomes. This work demonstrates that antibiotic interactions are highly variable when comparing across three gram-negative pathogens and highlights the importance of growth medium by showing a superior correlation between in vitro interactions in a growth medium that resembles the tissue environment and in vivo outcomes.","Davis, K.

Materials and MethodsP. aeruginosa and A. baumannii 48 h biofilms were grown in artificial saliva on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) discs, exposed to four disinfectants, with or without ultra-sonication, for 1 min and the number of viable bacteria post-exposure to the treatment determined. P. aeruginosa biofilms were exposed for one or five mins to two disinfectants plus a commercial sonicator.

ResultsUltra-sonication alone reduced total viable biofilm from 67.3% (A. baumannii) to 94.8% (P. aeruginosa). Without ultra-sonication, 0.012% sodium hypochlorite, Steradent(R) Active Plus and Ecolab(R) 0.2% chlorhexidine reduced P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii biofilms viable counts by between 99.3% and >99.99%. Sonication further reduced 99.3% kill to undetectable levels (>99.99% kill). Colgate(R)Total Pro-Gum Health Daily mouthwash reduced P. aeruginosa by 17% and A. baumannii biofilms by 2.1 log. These number were further reduced by >99.99% with sonication (p=<0.001). Domestic sonicators, such as those for cleaning jewellery at home, were effective when used in conjunction with denture cleaning agents.

ConclusionRapid reduction of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii biofilms on denture acrylic is possible with denture-cleaning agents and sonication

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234569,Bitter taste receptor-stimulated nitric oxide innate immune responses are reduced by loss of CFTR function in nasal epithelial cells and macrophages,"Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors identified on the tongue but expressed all over the body, including in airway cilia and macrophages, where T2Rs serve an immune role. T2R isoforms detect bitter metabolites (quinolones and acyl-homoserine lactones) secreted by gram negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF). T2R activation by bitter bacterial products triggers calcium-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production. In airway cells, the NO increases mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial properties. In macrophages, the same pathway enhances phagocytosis. Because prior studies linked CF with reduced NO, we hypothesized that CF cells may have reduced T2R/NO responses. Using qPCR, immunofluorescence, and live cell imaging of air-liquid interface cultures, we found primary nasal epithelial cells from both CF and non-CF patients exhibited similar T2R expression, localization, and calcium signals. However, CF cells exhibited reduced NO production also observed in immortalized CFBE41o-CF cells and non-CF 16HBE cells CRISPR modified with CF-causing mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). NO was restored by VX-770/VX-809 corrector/potentiator pretreatment, suggesting reduced NO in CF cells is due to loss of CFTR function. In nasal cells, reduced NO correlated with reduced ciliary and antibacterial responses. In primary human macrophages, inhibition of CFTR reduced NO production and phagocytosis during T2R stimulation. Together, these data suggest an intrinsic deficiency in T2R/NO signaling caused by loss of CFTR function that may contribute to intrinsic susceptibilities of CF patients to P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria that activate this pathway.","Carey, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234404,Toroidal displacement of Klebsiella pneumoniae by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a unique mechanism to avoid competition for iron,"Competition for resources is one of the major drivers for evolution and retention of new traits in microbial communities. Quorum-dependent traits of opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa allow it to survive and thrive in nature. Here, we report a unique surfactant-driven pushing mechanism that P. aeruginosa employs specifically against Klebsiella pneumoniae. The pushing is accomplished in a manner that is dependent on nutrient limitation and quorum sensing. We find that P. aeruginosa employs neither proteases nor toxic secondary metabolites against K. pneumoniae. Rhamnolipid biosurfactant appears to be the only factor required to displace Klebsiella effectively. Both rhamnolipid production and the pushing ability of P. aeruginosa are suppressed by iron supplementation. We show that both these bacteria produce several siderophores in minimal medium and rapidly deplete iron. Under these conditions, P. aeruginosa pushes Klebsiella away from the substratum using rhamnolipid, reducing the competition for iron. Our study describes a unique quorum and iron-responsive mechanism in P. aeruginosa to support its own growth during resource competition.","Pradhan, D.; Tanwar, A.; Parthasarathy, S.; Singh, V.",2022-09-23,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.21.508880,2,Varsha Singh,Indian Institute of Science,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.21.508880v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.21.508880v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234948,In vitro synergistic action of TAT-RasGAP317-326 peptide with antibiotics against Gram-negative pathogens,"ObjectivesMultidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are a continuously increasing threat for medicine, causing infections recalcitrant to antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were identified as alternatives to antibiotics, being naturally occurring short peptides and part of the innate immune system of a vast majority of organisms. However, the clinical application of AMPs is limited by suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties and relatively high toxicity. Combinatorial treatments using AMPs and classical antibiotics may decrease the concentrations of AMPs required for bacterial eradication, thus lowering the side effects of these peptides.

MethodsHere, we investigate the in vitro efficiency of combinations of the recently described antimicrobial peptide TAT-RasGAP317-326 with a panel of commonly used antimicrobial agents against three Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii using checkerboard and time-kill assays.

ResultsWe identified synergistic combinations towards all three bacteria and demonstrated that these combinations had an increased bactericidal effect compared to individual drugs. Moreover, combinations were also effective against clinical isolates of A. baumannii. Finally, combination of TAT-RasGAP317-326 and meropenem had a promising antibiofilm effect towards A. baumannii.

ConclusionTaken together, our results indicate that combinations of TAT-RasGAP317-326 with commonly-used antimicrobial agents may lead to the development of new treatment protocols against infections caused by MDR bacteria.","Vizzarro, G.; Jacquier, N.",2022-09-26,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.26.509445,1,Nicolas Jacquier,"Institute of Microbiology, University Hospital Center and University of Lausanne",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.26.509445v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.26.509445v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,234940,A small molecule that inhibits the evolution of antibiotic resistance,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) rapidly develops against almost all available therapeutics. New antibiotics target essential processes in bacteria but fail to address the root of the problem: mutagenesis and evolution. We recently proposed that inhibiting the molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial evolution is the ultimate solution to preventing AMR development. Here, we describe the first compound that inhibits the occurrence and progression of AMR by directly targeting a highly conserved bacterial evolvability factor, Mfd. We previously found that this RNA polymerase-associated translocase is required for rapid AMR development across highly divergent pathogens. Through an in vivo screen, we identified 43 potential Mfd-inhibiting compounds. Here we present on target validation, biochemical characterization, and in vivo efficacy studies of a lead compound, referred to as ARM-1. ARM-1 binds Mfd and modulates its RNA polymerase interaction. Inhibition of Mfd activity by ARM-1 delays the development of mutations and resistance acquisition, both in pure culture and during infection. Importantly, our data show that this compound prevents the evolution of AMR across highly divergent pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The novel compound we present here has the potential to develop into a clinically useful ""anti-evolution"" drug. This work demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms of evolution are pharmaceutically targetable, and that this strategy could help prevent AMR development.","Johnson, A. E.; Bracey, H.; Viera, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,235295,A filamentous phage triggers antiviral responses in cystic fibrosis basal airway epithelial cells,"Basal airway epithelial cells are a multipotent stem cell population which gives rise to several airway cell types. Basal cells are known to be critical to airway epithelium homeostasis and repair, and altered basal cell phenotypes have been reported in cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, very little is known about how basal cells respond to stimuli in the cystic fibrosis airway environment. Cystic fibrosis patients experience chronic infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and contain both high quantities of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as the filamentous bacteriophage Pf produced by biofilm-state P. aeruginosa in the airway. In this study, we sought to investigate the transcriptional responses of human basal cells from both healthy controls and patients with cystic fibrosis to LPS and Pf phage. Basal cells from wildtype and cystic fibrosis donors were cultured in vitro and exposed to LPS and/or Pf phage, followed by single-cell sequencing on the 10x platform. We report that basal cells show strong antiviral responses and neutrophil chemokine production in response to Pf phage. We validate these findings in additional donors by qRT-PCR and show that Pf phage is internalized by basal cells. We also show that Pf decreases basal cell migration and proliferation. We demonstrate that Pf phage, a bacteria-infecting virus which does not replicate in mammalian cells, is taken up by basal cells and activates immune responses. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of this antiviral response to bacterial clearance.

Author SummaryWhen we experience a lung infection or injury, the stem cells of the airway--called basal epithelial cells--are crucial for healing the affected tissue. Basal cells proliferate and migrate to close gaps in the epithelium and replace injured and dead cells. We are also learning that basal cells can directly contribute to the immune response against lung pathogens, although little is understood about how basal cells sense viruses and bacteria, and what molecules they secrete in response. In our work, we sought to investigate the role that basal cells play in the course of an infection with the common human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We stimulated basal cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immunogen produced by Pseudomonas, as well as the Pseudomonas-infecting virus Pf4. We have previously shown that Pf4, which is produced in high amounts by lung-infecting Pseudomonas, affects the immune response to this bacterium. In our work here, we show that Pf4 is recognized as a virus by basal cells and changes the transcriptional response to LPS, derailing the antibacterial immune response to Pseudomonas. These findings raise the question of whether other bacteria-infecting viruses alter immune responses, and how these viruses interact with other airway cells.","Popescu, M. C.; Haddock, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,235139,Combinatorial control of biofilm development by quorum-sensing and nutrient-sensing regulators.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections and formation of sessile antibiotic-resistant communities called biofilms is required for virulence in this pathogen. Biofilm formation is modulated by various environmental stimuli including nutrient availability, and population density and composition monitored via the cell-cell communication process of quorum sensing. Previous work has shown that the RhlR quorum-sensing receptor as well as CbrA/CbrB two-component system required for nutritional adaptation repress biofilm formation. How the information encoded in multiple sensory inputs is extracted and integrated to control biofilms is largely mysterious. Here, we use biofilm analyses, RNA-seq studies, and reporter assays to explore the combined effect of information flow through the RhlR quorum-sensing and CbrA nutrient-sensing pathways on biofilm development. We find that when both RhlR and CbrA are inactive, the resulting biofilm is unstable and readily evolves into a variant that mimics the absence of RhlR. Using genetic suppressor analysis and whole genome sequencing, we have identified the carbon catabolite repression protein Crc as the molecular convergence point for quorum and nutrient sensing. Crc promotes the expression of Pel exopolysaccharide, Functional amyloid protein and Cup fimbriae components of the biofilm matrix but does so only in the absence of both RhlR and CbrA. These results uncover a regulatory link between nutritional adaption and quorum sensing with potential implications for anti-biofilm targeting strategies.","Chen, G.; Lim, E. D.; Winkelman, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,235420,Correlation analysis between drug resistance and virulence genes of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii In Western Guilin,"BackgoundIn order to detect the resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii to {beta}-lactam antibiotics in western Guilin, analyze the reasons for its resistance, and provide laboratory basis for clinical treatment; method for the {beta}-lactamase gene of Acinetobacter baumannii, and to explore the relationship between the presence of the {beta}-lactamase gene of Acinetobacter baumannii and multidrug resistance.

MethodsFrom November 2020 to June 2022, 78 non-repeated Acinetobacter baumannii strains from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University were collected, and their resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was analyzed. PCR was used to detect resistance-related genes (blaOXA-23, blaOXA-51, blaOXA-58, blaOXA-24, blaIMP and blaSIM) and virulence genes (cusE, abaI and bfmS). To analyze the relationship between drug resistance and virulence genes of Acinetobacter baumannii.

ResultsMost of the 165 non-enterobacteriaceae bacteria we collected from the hospital were Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and most of the specimen types were from sputum and secretions, and most of them were from respiratory and critical care diseases area and intensive care unit, among them, there are 78 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii studied this time. After screening, 78 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were resistant to Cefazolin, Ampicillin, Amoxicillin/Clavulanate, Aztreonam, Chloramphenicol, Tetracycline, Cefotaxime, Ampicillin/Sulbactam, Piperacillin, Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, Moxifloxacin, Cefepime, Ceftazidime, Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Compound Sulfonamide, Meropenem, Imipenem, Amikacin, Polymyxin, resistance rates were 98.72%, 98.72%, 96.16%, 96.15%, 96.15%, 66.67%, 60.26%, 58.98%, 58.97%, 57.69%, 57.69%, 57.69%, 57.69%, 57.69%, 56.41%, 55.13%, 53.85%, 52.56%, 52.56%, 50%, 0%. Among them, 17 strains with drug resistance gene blaOXA-51 were detected,accounting for 21.79%; drug gene blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaIMP, blaOXA-58, blaSIM gene were not detected; 17 strains with virulence gene bfmS was detected, accounting for 21.79%; abaI, csuE virulence gene was not detected.

ConclusionAcinetobacter baumannii in the hospital is highly resistant to carbapenems, mainly carrying blaOXA-51 resistance genes. Drug resistance is closely related to the virulence gene bfmS.","Xiong, L.; Huang, X.; Chen, H.; Liu, Z.; Wang, D.; Zeng, G.; Mo, S.; Wei, C.",2022-09-30,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.28.510023,1,Chuandong Wei,The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guilin Medical University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.28.510023v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.28.510023v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,235399,The paradoxical relationship between CRISPR-Cas and phage susceptibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"CRISPR-Cas systems are part of the pan-immune system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and have been shown to limit horizontal gene transfers in that species. Indeed, isolates equipped with these systems tend to have smaller genomes and CRISPR spacers targeting integrative conjugative elements, phages, and plasmids. In this work, we investigate the genomic effects and phenotypic consequences of CRISPR-Cas systems in P. aeruginosa. First, we establish that the population structure is a confounding factor of the relation between genome sizes and the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems in P. aeruginosa as isolates from group II are, on average, 200 kbp larger than those from group I, and have a lower likelihood of possessing CRISPR-Cas systems. Second, we show that the impact on the genome size of CRISPR deactivation by anti-CRISPR proteins differs between the various CRISPR-Cas types found in this species (I-C, I-E, and I-F). Finally, we highlight a paradoxical, positive correlation between the presence of CRISPR-Cas systems and the chances of the host being infected by a set of distinct, strictly virulent Pseudomonas phages. We propose that this increased phage susceptibility in the presence of CRISPR-Cas is linked to a depletion of other accessory defense system genes in isolates with CRISPR-Cas systems.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,235609,A Zur-mediated transcriptional regulation of the zinc export system,"The control of cellular zinc (Zn) concentrations by dedicated import and export systems is essential for the survival and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The transcription of its many Zn transporters is therefore tightly regulated by a known set of transcription factors involved in either the import or the export of Zn. In this work, we show that the Zur protein, a well-known repressor of Zn import, plays a dual role and functions in both import and export processes. In a situation of Zn excess, Zur represses Zn entry, but also activates the transcription of czcR, a positive regulator of the Zn export system. To achieve this, Zur binds at two sites, located by DNA footprinting in the region downstream the czcR transcription start site. In agreement with this regulation, a delay in induction of the efflux system is observed in the absence of Zur and Zn resistance is affected. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire czcR 5 untranslated region or impairing Zur binding in the region is sufficient to restore the growth defect of a zur mutant in excess of zinc, disclosing an important link between Zur and zinc export. The discovery of this regulation highlights a new role of Zur as global regulator of Zn homeostasis in P. aeruginosa.","Ducret, V.; Gonzalez, D.; Leoni, S.; Valentini, M.; Perron, K.",2022-10-01,Microbiology,10.1101/2022.09.30.510347,1,Karl Perron,University of Geneva,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.30.510347v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.30.510347v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,27773,Optogenetics reprogramming of planktonic cells for biofilm formation,"Single-cell behaviors play essential roles during early-stage biofilms formation. In this study, we evaluated whether biofilm formation could be guided by precisely manipulating single cells behaviors. Thus, we established an illumination method to precisely manipulate the type IV pili (TFP) mediated motility and microcolony formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by using a combination of a high-throughput bacterial tracking algorithm, optogenetic manipulation and adaptive microscopy. We termed this method as Adaptive Tracking Illumination (ATI). We reported that ATI enables the precise manipulation of TFP mediated motility and microcolony formation during biofilm formation by manipulating bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) levels in single cells. Moreover, we showed that the spatial organization of single cells in mature biofilms can be controlled using ATI. Thus, the established method (i.e., ATI) can markedly promote ongoing studies of biofilms.","Jin, F.; Xia, A.; Yang, S.; Huang, Y.; Jin, Z.; Ni, L.; Pu, L.; Yang, G.",2017-12-04,Microbiology,10.1101/229229,1,Fan  Jin,University of Science and Technology of China,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/229229v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/229229v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA

The model is easy to setup and infection and virulence can be monitored for up to 10 days. In a first test of the model, we found that mung bean seedlings infected with PAO1 showed poor development of roots and high mortality rates compared to un-infected controls. We also found that a quorum sensing (QS) mutant was significantly less virulent when compared with the PAO1 wild type. Our work introduces a new tool for studying virulence in P. aeruginosa, that will allow for high throughput virulence studies of mutants, and for testing the in vivo efficacy of new therapies at a time when new antimicrobial drugs are desperately needed.","Garge, S.; Azimi, S.; Diggle, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,28005,Rapid diversification of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis lung-like conditions,"Chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality for adult CF patients. Prolonged infections are accompanied by adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the unique conditions of the CF lung environment as well as marked diversification of the pathogen into phenotypically and genetically distinct strains that can coexist for years within a patient. Little is known, however, about the causes of this diversification and its impact on patient health. Here, we show experimentally that, consistent with ecological theory of diversification, the nutritional conditions of the CF airway can cause rapid and extensive diversification of P. aeruginosa. The increased viscosity associated with the thick mucous layer in the CF airway had little impact on within-population diversification but did promote divergence among populations. Notably, in vitro evolution recapitulated patho-adaptive traits thought to be hallmarks of chronic infection, including reduced motility and increased biofilm formation, and the range of phenotypes observed in a collection of clinical isolates. Our results suggest that nutritional complexity and reduced dispersal can drive evolutionary diversification of P. aeruginosa independent of other features of the CF lung such as an active immune system or the presence of competing microbial species. They also underscore the need to obtain diverse samples of P. aeruginosa when developing treatment plans. We suggest that diversification, by generating extensive phenotypic and genetic variation on which selection can act, may be a key first step in the transition from transient to chronic infection.\n\nSignificance StatementChronic infection with the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the leading cause of lung transplant or death in cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa diversifies in the CF lung, although why this happens remains a mystery. We allowed P. aeruginosa to evolve in the laboratory under a range of conditions approximating the CF lung. The diversity of evolved populations was highest, and most closely resembled the range of phenotypes among clinical isolates, in environments resembling the spectrum of nutritional resources available in the CF lung. Our results point to the nutritional complexity of the CF lung as a major driver of diversification and they suggest that diversity could be important in the development of chronic infections.","Schick, A.; Kassen, R.",2017-12-08,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/231050,1,Alana  Schick,University of Ottawa,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/231050v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/231050v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1073/pnas.1721270115
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,28609,Characterisation and modelling of a polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Aquitalea sp. USM4 reveals a mechanism for polymer elongation,"Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase, PhaC, is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of PHA, a type of bioplastics with huge potential to replace conventional petroleum-based plastics. While two PhaC structures have been determined recently, the exact mechanism remains unclear partly due to the absence of a tunnel for product passage. The PhaC from Aquitalea sp. USM4, PhaCAq, was characterised and showed a Km of 394 {micro}M and a kcat of 476.4 s-1 on the 3HB-CoA substrate. A model based on the structure of the closely related PhaC from Cupriavidus necator, PhaCCn revealed a three-branched tunnel at the dimeric interface. Two of the branches open to the solvent and serve as the putative routes for substrate entrance and product exit, while the third branch is elongated in a PhaC1 model from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating a function of accommodating the hydroxyalkanoate (HA) moiety of the HA-CoA substrate. Docking of the two tetrahedral intermediates formed during catalysis suggests a PHA elongation mechanism that requires the HA moiety of the ligand to rotate ~180{degrees}. Both classes I and II PhaCs share a common mechanism for polymer elongation, and substrate specificity is determined in part by a bulky Phe/Tyr/Trp residue in the third branch in class I, which is conserved as Ala in class II to create room for longer substrates. The PhaCAq model provides fresh insights into a general PhaC mechanism, pinpointing key residues for potential engineering of PhaCs with desirable characteristics.","Teh, A.-H.; Chiam, N.-C.; Furusawa, G.; Sudesh, K.",2018-01-29,Molecular Biology,10.1101/235556,2,Aik-Hong  Teh,Universiti Sains Malaysia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/235556v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/235556v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.147
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,28720,Host adaptation mediated by intergenic evolution in a bacterial pathogen,"Bacterial pathogens evolve during the course of infection as they adapt to the selective pressures that confront them inside the host. Identification of adaptive mutations and their contributions to pathogen fitness remain a central challenge. Although mutations can either target intergenic or coding regions in the pathogen genome, studies of host adaptation have focused predominantly on molecular evolution within coding regions whereas the role of intergenic mutations remains unclear. Here, we address this issue and investigate the extent to which intergenic mutations contribute to the evolutionary response of pathogens to host environments, and if intergenic mutations have distinct roles in host adaptation. We characterize intergenic evolution in 44 lineages of a clinically important bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as they adapt to their hosts. We identify 88 intergenic regions in which parallel evolution occur. At the genetic level, we find that mutations in these regions under selection are located primarily within regulatory elements upstream of transcriptional start sites. At the functional level, we show that these mutations both create or destroy regulatory interactions in connection to transcriptional processes, and are directly responsible for evolution of important pathogenic phenotypes including antibiotic sensitivity. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations are more likely to be selected than coding region mutations, and that intergenic mutations enable essential genes to become targets of evolution. In summary, our results highlight the evolutionary significance of intergenic mutations in creating host-adapted variants, and that intergenic and coding regions have different qualitative and quantitative contributions to this process.\n\nSignificancePathogens adapt to their host during infection, but the contribution and function of non-coding intergenic sequences to adaptation is poorly understood. Here, genome-wide identification of adaptive mutations within intergenic regions demonstrates that these sequences constitute an important part of the genetic basis for host adaptation. We find that intergenic mutations are abundant relative to adaptive mutations within coding sequences, and can contribute directly to evolution of pathogen relevant traits. Importantly, we find that intergenic mutations modify expression of essential genes and thus make contributions that are functionally distinct from coding mutations. These results improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes in vivo, and can potentially assist in refining predictions of pathogen evolution, disease outcome, and antibiotic resistance development.","Khademi, H.; Jelsbak, L.",2017-12-23,Microbiology,10.1101/236000,3,Lars  Jelsbak,Technical University of Denmark,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/236000v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/236000v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1093/gbe/evz083
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,28630,Importance of homo-dimerization of Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 in DNA flap cleavage,"Fanconi-associated nuclease 1 (FAN1) removes interstrand DNA crosslinks (ICLs) through its DNA flap endonuclease and exonuclease activities. Crystal structures of human and bacterial FAN1 bound to a DNA flap have been solved. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial FAN1 and human FAN1 (hFAN1) missing a flexible loop are monomeric, while intact hFAN1 is homo-dimeric in structure. Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5 flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5 flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization. Our study therefore furnishes biochemical evidence for a role of hFAN1 homodimerization in biological processes that involve 5 DNA Flap cleavage.","Rao, T.; Longerich, S.; Zhao, W.; Aihara, H.; Sung, P.; Xiong, Y.",2017-12-18,Biochemistry,10.1101/236208,1,Yong  Xiong,"Yale University, New Haven, CT",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/236208v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/236208v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1016/j.dnarep.2018.02.007
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,28772,Discovery and biosynthesis of the antibiotic bicyclomycin in distant bacterial classes,"Bicyclomycin (BCM) is a clinically promising antibiotic that is biosynthesised by Streptomyces cinnamoneus DSM 41675. BCM is structurally characterized by a core cyclo(L-Ile-L-Leu) 2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP) that is extensively oxidized. Here, we identify the BCM biosynthetic gene cluster, which shows that the core of BCM is biosynthesised by a cyclodipeptide synthase and the oxidative modifications are introduced by five 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases and one cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The discovery of the gene cluster enabled the identification of BCM pathways encoded in the genomes of hundreds of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates distributed globally, and heterologous expression of the pathway from P. aeruginosa SCV20265 demonstrated that the product is chemically identical to BCM produced by S. cinnamoneus. Overall, putative BCM gene clusters have been found in at least seven genera spanning Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria (Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-). This represents a rare example of horizontal gene transfer of an intact biosynthetic gene cluster across such distantly related bacteria, and we show that these gene clusters are almost always associated with mobile genetic elements.\n\nIMPORTANCEBicyclomycin is the only natural product antibiotic that selectively inhibits the transcription termination factor Rho. This mechanism of action, combined with its proven biological safety and its activity against clinically relevant Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, makes it a very promising antibiotic candidate. Here, we report the identification of the bicyclomycin biosynthetic gene cluster in the known producing organism Streptomyces cinnamoneus, which will enable the engineered production of new bicyclomycin derivatives. The identification of this gene cluster also led to the discovery of hundreds of bicyclomycin pathways encoded in highly diverse bacteria, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This wide distribution of a complex biosynthetic pathway is very unusual, and provides an insight into how a pathway for an antibiotic can be transferred between diverse bacteria.","Vior, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,29070,Interaction of quercetin with transcriptional regulator LasR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Mechanistic insights of the inhibition of virulence through quorum sensing,"BackgroundPseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dangerous superbugs in the list of bacteria for which new antibiotics are urgently needed, which was published by World Health Organization. P. aeruginosa is an antibiotic-resistant opportunistic human pathogen. It affects patients with AIDS, cystic fibrosis, cancer, burn victims and people with prosthetics and implants. P. aeruginosa also forms biofilms. Biofilms increase resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses. Because of biofilms, current therapies are not effective. It is important to find new antibacterial treatment strategies against P. aeruginosa. Biofilm formation is regulated through a system called quorum sensing. Thus disrupting this system is considered a promising strategy to combat bacterial pathogenicity. It is known that quercetin inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation, but the mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we tried to analyse the mode of interactions of LasR with quercetin.\n\nResultsWe used a combination of molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and machine learning techniques for the study of the interaction of the LasR protein of P. aeruginosa with quercetin. We assessed the conformational changes of the interaction and analysed the molecular details of the binding of quercetin with LasR. We show that quercetin has two binding modes. One binding mode is the interaction with ligand binding domain, this interaction is not competitive and it has also been shown experimentally. The second binding mode is the interaction with the bridge, it involves conservative amino acid interactions from LBD, SLR, and DBD and it is also not competitive. Experimental studies show hydroxyl group of ring A is necessary for inhibitory activity, in our model the hydroxyl group interacts with Leu177 during the second binding mode. This could explain the molecular mechanism of how quercetin inhibits LasR protein.\n\nConclusionsThis study may offer insights on how quercetin inhibits quorum sensing circuitry by interacting with transcriptional regulator LasR. The capability of having two binding modes may explain why quercetin is effective at inhibiting biofilm formation and virulence gene expression.\n\nList of abbreviations","Grabski, H.; Hunanyan, L.; Tiratsuyan, S.; Vardapetyan, H.",2017-12-27,Bioinformatics,10.1101/239996,1,Hovakim  Grabski,Russian-Armenian University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/239996v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/239996v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,29482,Cross-feeding modulates antibiotic tolerance in bacterial communities,"Microbes frequently rely on metabolites excreted by other bacterial species, but little is known about how this cross-feeding influences the effect of antibiotics. We hypothesized that when species rely on each other for essential metabolites, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all species will drop to that of the \""weakest link\"" - the species least resistant in monoculture. We tested this hypothesis in an obligate cross-feeding system that was engineered between Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Methylobacterium extorquens. The effect of tetracycline and ampicillin were tested on both liquid and solid media. In all cases, resistant species were inhibited at significantly lower antibiotic concentrations in the cross-feeding community than in monoculture or a competitive community. However, deviation from the \""weakest link\"" hypothesis was also observed in cross-feeding communities apparently as result of changes in the timing of growth and cross-protection. Comparable results were also observed in a clinically relevant system involving facultative cross-feeding between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an anaerobic consortium found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. P. aeruginosa was inhibited by lower concentrations of ampicillin when cross-feeding than when grown in isolation. These results suggest that cross-feeding significantly alters tolerance to antibiotics in a variety of systems.","Adamowicz, E. M.; Hunter, R. C.; Flynn, J.; Harcombe, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,30068,Comparative transcriptomics reveals a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response (BAPR) to viral predation,"Intrinsic and acquired defenses against bacteriophages, including Restriction/Modification, CRISPR/Cas, and Toxin/Anti-toxin systems have been intensely studied, with profound scientific impacts. However, adaptive defenses against phage infection analogous to adaptive resistance to antimicrobials have yet to be described. To identify such mechanisms, we applied an RNAseq-based, comparative transcriptomics approach in different Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains after independent infection by a set of divergent virulent bacteriophages. A common host-mediated adaptive stress response to phages was identified that includes the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal, through which infected cells inform their neighbors of infection, and what may be a resistance mechanism that functions by reducing infection vigor. With host transcriptional machinery left intact, we also observe phage-mediated differential expression caused by phage-specific stresses and molecular mechanisms. These responses suggest the presence of a conserved Bacterial Adaptive Phage Response mechanism as a novel type of host defense mechanism, and which may explain transient forms of phage persistence.","Blasdel, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,30269,Low spatial structure and selection against secreted virulence factors attenuates pathogenicity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacterial opportunistic pathogens are feared for their difficult-to-treat nosocomial infections and for causing morbidity in immunocompromised patients. Here, we study how such a versatile opportunist, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, adapts to conditions inside and outside its model host Caenorhabditis elegans, and use phenotypic and genotypic screens to identify the mechanistic basis of virulence evolution. We found that virulence significantly dropped in unstructured environments both in the presence and absence of the host, but remained unchanged in spatially structured environments. Reduction of virulence was either driven by a substantial decline in the production of siderophores (in treatments without hosts) or toxins and proteases (in treatments with hosts). Whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones revealed positive selection and parallel evolution across replicates, and showed an accumulation of mutations in regulator genes controlling virulence factor expression. Our study identifies the spatial structure of the non-host environment as a key driver of virulence evolution in an opportunistic pathogen.","Granato, E. T.; Ziegenhain, C.; Marvig, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,31377,A proteolytic complex targets multiple cell wall hydrolases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) occur in all three domains of life. In bacteria some of them have been associated with virulence. However, the precise roles of bacterial CTPs are poorly understood and few direct proteolytic substrates have been identified. One bacterial CTP is the CtpA protease of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. Here, we have investigated the function of CtpA in P. aeruginosa and identified some of the proteins it cleaves. We discovered that CtpA forms a complex with a previously uncharacterized protein, which we have named LbcA (lipoprotein binding partner of CtpA). LbcA is required for CtpA activity in vivo and promotes its activity in vitro. We have also identified four proteolytic substrates of CtpA, all of which are uncharacterized proteins predicted to cleave the peptide cross-links within peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, a ctpA null mutant was found to have fewer peptidoglycan cross-links than the wild type and grew slowly in salt-free medium. Intriguingly, the accumulation of just one of the CtpA substrates was required for some {Delta}ctpA mutant phenotypes, including the defective T3SS. We propose that LbcA*CtpA is a proteolytic complex in the P. aeruginosa cell envelope, which controls the activity of several peptidoglycan cross-link hydrolases by degrading them. Furthermore, based on these and other findings we suggest that many bacterial CTPs might be similarly controlled by partner proteins as part of a widespread mechanism to control peptidoglycan hydrolase activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacterial carboxy-terminal processing proteases (CTPs) are widely conserved and have been associated with the virulence of several species. However, their roles are poorly understood and few direct substrates have been identified in any species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important human pathogen in which one CTP, known as CtpA, is required for type III secretion system function, and for virulence. This work provides an important advance by showing that CtpA works with a previously uncharacterized binding partner to degrade four substrates. These substrates are all predicted to hydrolyze peptidoglycan cross-links, suggesting that the CtpA complex is an important control mechanism for peptidoglycan hydrolysis. This is likely to emerge as a widespread mechanism used by diverse bacteria to control some of their peptidoglycan hydrolases. This is significant, given the links between CTPs and virulence in several pathogens, and the importance of peptidoglycan remodeling to almost all bacterial cells.","Srivastava, D.; Seo, J.; Rimal, B.; Kim, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,33535,Whole genome sequencing reveals the emergence of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa shared strain sub-lineage among patients treated within a single cystic fibrosis centre,"BackgroundChronic lung infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Shared P. aeruginosa strains, that can be transmitted between patients, are of concern and in Australia the AUST-02 shared strain is predominant in individuals attending CF centres in Queensland and Western Australia. M3L7 is a multidrug resistant sub-type of AUST-02 that was recently identified in a Queensland CF centre and was shown to be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The main aim of this study was to resolve the relationship of the emergent M3L7 sub-type within the AUST-02 group of strains using whole genome sequencing.\n\nResultsA whole-genome core phylogeny of 63 isolates indicated that M3L7 is a monophyletic sub-lineage within the context of the broader AUST-02 group. Relatively short branch lengths connected all of the M3L7 isolates. A phylogeny based on nucleotide polymorphisms present across the genome showed that the chronological estimation of the most recent common ancestor was around 2001 ({+/-} 3 years). SNP differences between sequential M3L7 isolates collected 3-4 years apart from five patients suggested both continuous infection of the same strain and cross-infection of some M3L7 variants between patients. The majority of polymorphisms that were characteristic of M3L7 (i.e. acquired after divergence from all other AUST-02 isolates sequenced) were found to produce non-synonymous mutations in virulence and antibiotic resistance genes.\n\nConclusionsM3L7 has recently diverged from a common ancestor indicating descent from a single carrier at a CF treatment centre in Australia. Both adaptation to the lung and transmission of M3L7 between adults attending this centre may have contributed to its rapid dissemination.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,31861,Competition in biofilms between cystic fibrosis isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is influenced by R-pyocins,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a number of different human infections and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa infections are difficult to treat due to a number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and the organisms propensity to form multicellular biofilms. Epidemic strains of P. aeruginosa often dominate within the lungs of individual CF patients, but how they achieve this is poorly understood. One of the ways strains of P. aeruginosa can compete, is by producing chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, called pyocins. Three major classes of pyocin have been identified in P. aeruginosa: soluble pyocins (S-types) and tailocins (R- and F-types). In this study, we investigated the distribution of S- and R-type pyocins in 24 clinical strains isolated from individual CF patients and then focused on understanding their roles on inter-strain competition. We found that (i) each strain produced only one R-pyocin type, but the number of S-pyocins varied between strains; (ii) R-pyocins were generally important for strain dominance during competition assays in planktonic cultures and biofilm communities in strains with both disparate R and S pyocin sub-types. (iii) purified R-pyocins demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against established biofilms. Our work provides support for a key role played by R-pyocins in the competition between P. aeruginosa strains, and may help explain why certain strains and lineages of P. aeruginosa dominate and displace others during CF lung infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of exploiting R-pyocins for therapeutic gains in an era when antibiotic resistance is a global concern.\n\nIMPORTANCEA major clinical problem caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is chronic biofilm infection of the lungs in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Epidemic P. aeruginosa strains dominate and displace others during CF infection, but these intra-species interactions remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that R-pyocins (bacterocins) are important factors in driving competitive interactions in biofilms between P. aeruginosa strains isolated from different CF patients. In addition, we found that these phage-like pyocins are inhibitory against mature biofilms of susceptible strains. This highlights the potential of R-pyocins as antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, at a time when new antimicrobial therapies are desperately needed.","Oluyombo, O.; Penfold, C. N.; Diggle, S.

The soil samples were contaminated with 5% (w/v) of spent engine oil and the rate of biodegradation of the oil was studied for a period of 10weeks under greenhouse experiment. The total heterotrophic bacteria count (THBC), total hydrocarbon degrading bacteria count (THDBC), physicochemical and heavy metals properties of the soil samples and Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon (TPH) were determined after treatment with test organisms. THBC and THDBC ranged from 0.175 to 0.280 CFUg-1 and 0.47 CFUg-1 respectively for the control plot, while THBC is ranging from 0.197 to 0.275 CFUg-1 and THDBC was 0.180 to 0. 473 CFUg-1 for the contaminated plot.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,32419,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing receptor balances ligand selectivity and sensitivity,"Quorum sensing is a cell-cell communication process that bacteria use to orchestrate group behaviors. Quorum sensing is mediated by extracellular signal molecules called autoinducers. Autoinducers are often structurally similar, raising questions concerning how bacteria distinguish among them. Here, we use the Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasR quorum-sensing receptor to explore receptor sensitivity and selectivity. Alteration of LasR amino acid S129 increases ligand selectivity and decreases ligand sensitivity. Conversely, the L130F mutation enhances LasR sensitivity while reducing selectivity. We solve crystal structures of LasR ligand binding domains complexed with non-cognate autoinducers. Comparison to existing structures reveals that ligand selectivity/sensitivity is mediated by a flexible loop adjacent to the ligand binding site. We show that P. aeruginosa harboring LasR variants with modified selectivity or sensitivity exhibit altered quorum-sensing responses. We suggest that an evolutionary trade-off between ligand selectivity and sensitivity enables LasR to optimally regulate quorum-sensing traits.","Bassler, B. L.; Mccready, A. R.; Paczkowski, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,33744,Pseudomonas aeruginosa partitioning protein ParB acts as a nucleoid-associated protein binding to multiple copies of a parS-related motif.,"ParA and ParB homologs are involved in accurate chromosome segregation in bacteria. ParBs participate in separation of ori domains by binding to specific parS sites, mainly localized close to oriC. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa neither a lack of parB gene nor modification of ten parSs is lethal. Remarkably, such mutants show not only defects in chromosome segregation but also growth retardation and motility dysfunctions. Moreover, a lack of parB alters expression of over one thousand genes, suggesting that ParB could interact with the chromosome outside its canonical parS targets.\n\nIndeed, DNA immunoprecipitation with anti-ParB antibodies followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed 420 enriched regions in WT PAO1161 strain and around 1000 in a ParB-overproducing strain and in various parS mutants. Vast majority of the ParB-enriched loci contained a heptanucleotide motif corresponding to one arm of the parS palindrome. All previously postulated parS sites with the exception of parS5 interacted with ParB in vivo. Whereas the ParB binding to the four parS sites closest to oriC, parS1-4, is involved in chromosome segregation, its genome-wide interactions with hundreds of parS half-sites could affect chromosome topology, compaction and gene expression classifying P. aeruginosa ParB as a Nucleoid Associated Protein (NAP).","Kawalek, A.; Bartosik, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35245,Astroplastic: A start-to-finish process for polyhydroxybutyrate production from solid human waste using genetically engineered bacteria to address the challenges for future manned Mars missions,"Space exploration has long been a source of inspiration, challenging scientists and engineers to find innovative solutions to various problems. One of the current focuses in space exploration is to send humans to Mars. However, the challenge of transporting materials to Mars and the need for waste management processes are two major obstacles for these long-duration missions.\n\nTo address these two challenges a process called Astroplastic was developed that produces polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) from solid human waste, which can be used to 3D print useful items for astronauts. PHB granules are naturally produced by bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha and Pseudomonas aeruginosa for carbon and energy storage. The phaJ, phaC, and phaCBA genes were cloned from these native PHB-producing bacteria into Escherichia coli. These genes code for enzymes that aid in PHB production by converting products of glycolysis and {beta}-oxidation pathways, such as acetyl-CoA and enoyl-CoA, into PHB. To ensure a continuous PHB production system and to eliminate the need for cell lysis to extract PHB, recombinant E. coli was engineered to use the genes in its natural type I secretion system to secrete PHB. The C-terminal of the HlyA secretion tag was fused to phasin (PhaP), a protein originally from R. eutropha. Phasin-HlyA electrostatically binds PHB granules and transports them outside of the cell.\n\nIn addition to genetically engineering bacteria, a concept for start-to-finish PHB production process was designed. Integrating expert feedback and experimental results, conditions for each step of the process including the collection and storage of waste, volatile fatty acid (VFA) fermentation, VFA extraction, PHB fermentation, and PHB extraction were optimized. The optimized system will provide a sustainable and continuous PHB production system, which will address the problems of transportation costs and waste management for future space missions.\n\nFinancial DisclosureMindfuel Science Alberta Foundation Genome Alberta GenScript Polyferm Canada GeekStarter Alberta Integrated DNA Technologies University of Calgary University of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine University of Calgary Bachelor of Sciences University of Calgary Schulich School of Engineering University of Calgary OBrien Centre for the Bachelor of Health Sciences City of Calgary Alberta Innovates The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.\n\nCompeting InterestsThe authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nEthics StatementN/A\n\nData AvailabilityAll data are freely available without restriction.","Chen, X.; Ibrahim, S.; Kunitskaya, A.; Schaaf, K.; Wang, Z.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,34790,C. elegans avoidance of Pseudomonas: thioredoxin shapes the sensory response to bacterially produced nitric oxide,"We show that C. elegans avoids a bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) by detecting PA14-produced nitric oxide (NO). PA14 mutants deficient for NO production fail to elicit avoidance and NO donors repel worms. PA14 and NO avoidance are mediated by the ASJ chemosensory neurons, which respond to NO with intracellular calcium rises. PA14 avoidance and NO-evoked calcium responses require receptor guanylate cyclases (DAF-11 and GCY-27), and cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels (TAX-2 and -4). ASJ exhibits calcium increases at both the onset and removal of NO. These NO-evoked ON and OFF calcium transients are affected by a redox sensing protein, TRX-1/thioredoxin. TRX-1s trans-nitrosylation activity inhibits the ON transient whereas TRX-1s de-nitrosylation activity promotes the OFF transient. Thus, C. elegans exploits bacterially produced NO as a cue to mediate avoidance and TRX-1 functions as an NO-sensor that endows ASJ with a bi-phasic response to NO exposure.","Kaplan, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35313,Modulation of antibiotic sensitivity and biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by interspecies diffusible signal factor analogues,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can participate in inter-species communication through signaling by cis-2-unsaturated fatty acids of the diffusible signal factor (DSF) family. Sensing these signals involves the histidine kinase PA1396 and leads to altered biofilm formation and increased tolerance to various antibiotics. Here, we show that the membrane-associated sensory input domain of PA1396 has five trans-membrane helices, two of which are required for DSF sensing. DSF binding is associated with enhanced auto-phosphorylation of PA1396 incorporated into liposomes. Further, we examined the ability of synthetic DSF analogues to modulate or inhibit PA1396 activity. Several of these analogues block the ability of DSF to trigger auto-phosphorylation and gene expression, whereas others act as inverse agonists reducing biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance, both in vitro and in murine infection models. These analogues may thus represent lead compounds for novel adjuvants to improve the efficacy of existing antibiotics.","An, S.-Q.; Murtagh, J.; Twomey, K. B.; Gupta, M. K.; O'sullivan, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35293,Synonymous lysine codon usage modification in a mobile antibiotic resistance gene similarly alters protein production in bacterial species with divergent lysine codon usage biases because it removes a duplicate AAA lysine codon.,"The mobile antibiotic resistance gene blaIMP-1 is clinically important and has a synonymous AAA:AAG lysine codon usage bias of 73:27. This bias is like that seen in experimentally determined highly expressed genes in Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumanii, but quite different from that seen in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26:74 AAA:AAG). Here we show that, paradoxically, shifting the AAA:AAG lysine codon bias to 8:92 in blaIMP-1 expressed from a natural promoter results in significantly more IMP-1 production in all three species. Sequential site directed mutagenesis revealed that increased IMP-1 production occurs following removal of an AAA,AAA double lysine codon and that otherwise, lysine codon usage had no observable impact on IMP-1 production. We conclude that ribosomal slippage at this poly-adenosine region reduces efficient translation of IMP-1 and that punctuating the region with guanine reduces ribosomal slippage and increases IMP-1 production.","Alorabi, M.; Alamri, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35754,A fast and agnostic method for bacterial genome-wide association studies: bridging the gap between kmers and genetic events,"MotivationGenome-wide association study (GWAS) methods applied to bacterial genomes have shown promising results for genetic marker discovery or fine-assessment of marker effect. Recently, alignment-free methods based on kmer composition have proven their ability to explore the accessory genome. However, they lead to redundant descriptions and results which are hard to interpret.\n\nMethodsHere, we introduce DBGWAS, an extended kmer-based GWAS method producing interpretable genetic variants associated with pheno-types. Relying on compacted De Bruijn graphs (cDBG), our method gathers cDBG nodes identified by the association model into subgraphs defined from their neighbourhood in the initial cDBG. DBGWAS is fast, alignment-free and only requires a set of contigs and phenotypes. It produces annotated subgraphs representing local polymorphisms as well as mobile genetic elements (MGE) and offers a graphical framework to interpret GWAS results.\n\nResultsWe validated our method using antibiotic resistance phenotypes for three bacterial species. DBGWAS recovered known resistance determinants such as mutations in core genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and genes acquired by horizontal transfer in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - along with their MGE context. It also enabled us to formulate new hypotheses involving genetic variants not yet described in the antibiotic resistance literature.\n\nConclusionOur novel method proved its efficiency to retrieve any type of phenotype-associated genetic variant without prior knowledge. All experiments were computed in less than two hours and produced a compact set of meaningful subgraphs, thereby outperforming other GWAS approaches and facilitating the interpretation of the results.\n\nAvailabilityOpen-source tool available at https://gitlab.com/leoisl/dbgwas","Jaillard, M.; Lima, L.; Tournoud, M.; Mahe, P.; Van Belkum, A.; Lacroix, V.; Jacob, L.",2018-04-09,Bioinformatics,10.1101/297754,1,Magali  Jaillard,"bioMérieux, France",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/297754v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/297754v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pgen.1007758
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35779,Low nutrient levels reduce the fitness cost of MexCD-OprJ efflux pump overexpression in ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The long-term persistence of antibiotic resistance in the environment is a public health concern. Expression of an efflux pump, an important mechanism of resistance to antibiotics, is usually associated with a fitness cost in bacteria. In this study, we aimed to determine why antibiotic resistance conferred by overexpression of an efflux pump persists in environments such as drinking and source water in which antibiotic selective pressure may be very low or even absent. Competition experiments between wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa and ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants revealed that the fitness cost of ciprofloxacin resistance (strains cip_1, cip_2, and cip_3) significantly decreased (P < 0.05) under low-nutrient (0.5 mg/l total organic carbon (TOC)) relative to high-nutrient (500 mg/l TOC) conditions. Mechanisms underlying this fitness cost were analyzed. MexD gene expression in resistant bacteria (cip_3 strain) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in low-nutrient conditions, with 10 mg/l TOC (8.01 {+/-} 0.82-fold), than in high-nutrient conditions, with 500 mg/l TOC (48.89 {+/-} 4.16-fold). Moreover, rpoS gene expression in resistant bacteria (1.36 {+/-} 0.13-fold) was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that in the wild-type strain (2.78 {+/-} 0.29-fold) under low-nutrient conditions (10 mg/l TOC), suggesting a growth advantage. Furthermore, the difference in metabolic activity between the two competing strains was significantly smaller (P < 0.05) in low-nutrient conditions (5 and 0.5 mg/l TOC). These results suggest that nutrient levels are a key factor in determining the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance conferred by efflux pumps in the natural environment with trace amounts or no antibiotics.\n\nImportanceThe widespread of antibiotic resistance has led to an increasing concern about the environmental and public health risks. Mechanisms associated with antibiotic resistance including efflux pumps often increase bacterial fitness cost. Our study showed that the fitness cost of ciprofloxacin resistance conferred by overexpression of MexCD-OprJ efflux pump significantly decreased under low-nutrient relative to high-nutrient conditions. The significance of our research is to reveal that nutrient levels are key factor in determining the persistence of antibiotic resistance conferred by efflux pumps under conditions with trace amounts or no antibiotics, which can be mediated by some mechanisms including MexD gene expression, SOURs differences, and rpoS gene regulation.","Lin, W.; Wan, K.; Zeng, J.; Li, J.; Li, X.; Yu, X.",2018-04-10,Microbiology,10.1101/298471,1,Xin  Yu,"Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298471v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298471v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35801,Label-free visualization of type IV pili dynamics by interferometric scattering microscopy,"Type IV pili (TFP) are slender objects that assemble by polymerization and secretion of protein subunits from bacterial cell surfaces. The mechanisms by which these surface structures of microscopic length and molecular diameter modulate the physical interaction of bacteria with their environment, however, remains poorly understood largely due to limitations in our ability to monitor and characterize the dynamics of individual TFP. Here, we demonstrate that interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) enables label-free and dynamic visualization of TFP in intact cells of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. As a result, we can directly monitor extension, attachment and retraction events on millisecond timescale and nanometer length scale in three dimensions. These capabilities allow us to observe that P. aeruginosa is able to crawl against the direction of flow using short TFP filaments. Also, careful observation show that TFP retract rapidly after surface attachment, suggesting that P. aeruginosa senses contact of the pilus tip with the solid substrate. These results illustrate the power of iSCAT for the label-free visualization of small, dynamic microbial extracellular structures.","Tala, L.; Fineberg, A.; Kukura, P.; Persat, A.",2018-04-10,Microbiology,10.1101/298562,1,Alexandre  Persat,EPFL,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298562v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/298562v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41564-019-0378-9
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,35821,Agmatine accumulation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates confers antibiotic tolerance and dampens host inflammation.,"In the cystic fibrosis (CF) airways, Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes diverse physiological changes in response to inflammation, antibiotic pressure, oxidative stress and a dynamic bioavailable nutrient pool. These include loss-of-function mutations that result in reduced virulence, altered metabolism and other phenotypes that are thought to confer a selective advantage for long-term persistence. Recently, clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa that hyperproduce agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) were cultured from individuals with CF. Sputum concentrations of this metabolite were also shown to correlate with disease severity. This raised the question of whether agmatine accumulation might also confer a selective advantage for P. aeruginosa in vivo during chronic colonization of the lung. Here, we screened a library of P. aeruginosa CF clinical isolates and found that ~5% of subjects harbored isolates with an agmatine hyperproducing phenotype. Agmatine accumulation was a direct result of mutations in aguA, encoding the arginine deiminase that catalyzes the conversion of agmatine into various polyamines. We also found that agmatine hyperproducing isolates (aguA-) had increased tolerance to the cationic antibiotics gentamicin, tobramycin and colistin relative to their chromosomally complemented strains (aguA+). Finally, we revealed that agmatine diminishes IL-8 production by airway epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection, with a consequent decrease in neutrophil recruitment to the murine airways in an acute pneumonia model. These data highlight a potential new role for bacterial-derived agmatine that may have important consequences for the long-term persistence of P. aeruginosa in the CF airways.","Mccurtain, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36033,An important role for periplasmic storage in Pseudomonas aeruginosa copper homeostasis revealed by a combined experimental and computational modeling study,"Biological systems require precise copper homeostasis enabling metallation of cuproproteins while preventing metal toxicity. In bacteria, sensing, transport and storage molecules act in coordination to fulfill these roles. However, there is not yet a kinetic schema explaining the system integration. Here, we report a model emerging from experimental and computational approaches that describes the dynamics of copper distribution in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Based on copper uptake experiments, a minimal kinetic model describes well the copper distribution in the wild type bacteria but is unable to explain the behavior of the mutant strain lacking CopA1, a key Cu+ efflux ATPase. The model was expanded through an iterative hypothesis-driven approach, arriving to a mechanism that considers the induction of compartmental pools and the parallel function of CopA and Cus efflux systems. Model simulations support the presence of a periplasmic copper storage with a crucial role under dyshomeostasis conditions in P. aeruginosa. Importantly, the model predicts not only the interplay of periplasmic and cytoplasmic pools but also the existence of a threshold in the concentration of external copper beyond which cells lose their ability to control copper levels.","Parmar, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36202,A k-mer-based method for the identification of phenotype-associated genomic biomarkers and predicting phenotypes of sequenced bacteria.,"We have developed an easy-to-use and memory-efficient method called PhenotypeSeeker that (a) generates a k-mer-based statistical model for predicting a given phenotype and (b) predicts the phenotype from the sequencing data of a given bacterial isolate. The method was validated on 167 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (virulence), 200 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (ciprofloxacin resistance) and 460 Clostridium difficile isolates (azithromycin resistance). The phenotype prediction models trained from these datasets performed with 88% accuracy on the K. pneumoniae test set, 88% on the P. aeruginosa test set and 96.5% on the C. difficile test set. Prediction accuracy was the same for assembled sequences and raw sequencing data; however, building the model from assembled genomes is significantly faster. On these datasets, the model building on a mid-range Linux server takes approximately 3 to 5 hours per phenotype if assembled genomes are used and 10 hours per phenotype if raw sequencing data are used. The phenotype prediction from assembled genomes takes less than one second per isolate. Thus, PhenotypeSeeker should be well-suited for predicting phenotypes from large sequencing datasets.\n\nPhenotypeSeeker is implemented in Python programming language, is open-source software and is available at GitHub (https://github.com/bioinfo-ut/PhenotypeSeeker/).\n\nSummaryPredicting phenotypic properties of bacterial isolates from their genomic sequences has numerous potential applications. A good example would be prediction of antimicrobial resistance and virulence phenotypes for use in medical diagnostics. We have developed a method that is able to predict phenotypes of interest from the genomic sequence of the isolate within seconds. The method uses statistical model that can be trained automatically on isolates with known phenotype. The method is implemented in Python programming language and can be run on low-end Linux server and/or on laptop computers.","Aun, E.; Brauer, A.; Kisand, V.; Tenson, T.; Remm, M.",2018-04-17,Bioinformatics,10.1101/302026,2,Erki  Aun,"Department of Bioinformatics, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Estonia",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/302026v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/302026v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006434
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36265,Antimicrobial Efficacy and Safety of a Novel Gas Plasma-Activated Catheter Lock Solution,"Antimicrobial lock solutions are important for prevention of microbial colonization and infection of long-term central venous catheters. We investigated the efficacy and safety of a novel antibiotic-free lock solution formed from gas plasma-activated disinfectant (PAD). Using a luminal biofilm model, viable cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans in mature biofilms were reduced by 6 - 8 orders of magnitude with a PAD lock for 60 minutes. Subsequent 24-hour incubation of PAD-treated samples resulted in no detectable regrowth of viable bacteria or fungi. As a comparison, the use of a minocycline/EDTA/ethanol lock solution for 60 minutes led to regrowth of bacteria and fungi, up to 107 - 109 CFU/ml, in 24 hours. The PAD lock solution had minimal impact on human umbilical vein endothelial cell viability, whereas the minocycline/EDTA/ethanol solution elicited cell death in nearly half of human endothelial cells. Additionally, PAD treatment caused little topological change to catheter materials. In conclusion, PAD represents a novel antibiotic-free, non-cytotoxic lock solution that elicits rapid and broad-spectrum eradication of biofilm-laden microbes and which shows promise for the prevention and treatment of intravascular catheter infections.","Bhatt, S.; Mehta, P.; Chen, C.; Daines, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36306,Structure-guided disruption of pseudopilus tip inhibits Type II secretion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes the Type II secretion system (T2SS) to translocate a wide range of large, structured protein virulence factors through the periplasm to the extracellular environment for infection. In the T2SS, five pseudopilins assemble into the pseudopilus that acts as a piston to extrude exoproteins out of cells. Through structure determination of the pseudopilin complexes of XcpVWX and XcpVW and function analysis, we have confirmed that two minor pseudopilins, XcpV and XcpW, constitute a core complex indispensable to the pseudopilus tip. The absence of either XcpV or -W resulted in the non-functional T2SS. Our small-angle X-ray scattering experiment for the first time revealed the architecture of the entire pseudopilus tip and established the working model. Based on the interaction interface of complexes, we have developed inhibitory peptides. The structure-based peptides not only disrupted of the XcpVW core complex and the entire pseudopilus tip in vitro but also inhibited the T2SS in vivo. More importantly, these peptides effectively reduced the virulence of P. aeruginosa towards Caenorhabditis elegans.","Jia, Z.; Zhang, Y.; Faucher, F.; Zhang, W.; Wang, S.; Neville, N.; Poole, K.; Zheng, J.",2018-04-17,Microbiology,10.1101/303123,1,Zongchao  Jia,Queen's University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/303123v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/303123v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007343
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36387,Network analysis reveals differential metabolic functionality in antibiotic-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Metabolic adaptations accompanying the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria remain poorly understood. To interrogate this relationship, we profiled the growth of lab-evolved antibiotic-resistant lineages of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa across 190 unique carbon sources. We semi-automatically calculated growth dynamics (maximum growth density, growth rate, and time to mid-exponential phase) of over 2,800 growth curves. These data revealed that the evolution of antibiotic resistance resulted in systems-level changes to growth dynamics and metabolic phenotype. Drug-resistant lineages predominantly displayed decreased growth relative to the ancestral lineage; however, resistant lineages occasionally displayed enhanced growth on certain carbon sources, indicating that adaption to drug can provide a growth advantage in certain environments. A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction (GENRE) of P. aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14 was paired with whole-genome sequencing data of one of the drug-evolved lineages to predict genes contributing to observed changes in metabolism. Finally, we experimentally validated in silico predictions to identify genes mutated in resistant P. aeruginosa affecting loss of catabolic function. Our results build upon previous mechanistic knowledge of drug-induced metabolic adaptation and provide a framework for the identification of metabolic limitations in antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Robust drug-driven changes in bacterial metabolism have the potential to be exploited to select against antibiotic-resistant populations in chronic infections.","Dunphy, L. J.; Yen, P.; Papin, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36786,Autotransporter secretion exploits the bacterial actin-homologue,"Bacterial infection of humans, animals and plants relies heavily on secreted proteases that degrade host defences or activate bacterial toxins. The largest family of proteins secreted by Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, the Autotransporters (ATs), includes key proteolytic virulence factors. There remains uncertainty about the mechanistic steps of the pathway ATs share to exit bacteria, and how it is energetically driven. This study set out to shed light on the AT secretion pathway with the ultimate aim of uncovering novel antimicrobial targets that would be unlikely to trigger the development of resistance mechanisms in bacteria. To do this, two AT virulence factors with distinct proteolytic functions, EspC (secreted from Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli) and AaaA (tethered to the extracellular surface of Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were chosen. EspC and AaaA were fluorescently labelled using two separate methods to establish the localization patterns of ATs as they are secreted from a bacterial cell. Super resolution microscopy revealed that localization of ATs occurs via a helical route along the bacterial cytoskeleton. In addition to requiring the conserved C-terminal {beta}-barrel translocator domain of the AT, we present the first evidence that secretion is dependent on a dynamic interaction with a structure reliant upon the actin homologue MreB and the Sec translocon. These findings provide a step forward in the mechanistic understanding of the secretion of this widely distributed family of proteins that have pivotal roles in bacterial pathogenesis and conserved structural properties that could serve as novel broad-range antimicrobial targets.\n\nSignificanceSecreted bacterial proteases facilitate the infection of human, animal and plant hosts by degrading host defences or activating bacterial toxins. The autotransporter family is the largest family of proteins secreted from Gram-negative bacteria, and includes proteolytic virulence factors crucial to bacterial infection. Precisely how autotransporters migrate from the inside to the outside of the cell, and how this movement is energetically driven is a mystery. We demonstrate a spiral pathway of autotransporter secretion, presenting evidence that it involves a dynamic interaction with the actin homologue MreB that comprises the bacterial cytoskeleton. Our findings open the way to unravelling the mechanism of autotransporter secretion and offer the possibility to identify novel antimicrobial targets unlikely to trigger the development of antimicrobial resistance.","Ashawesh, M.; Markus, R.; Penfold, C.; Hardie, K.",2018-04-27,Microbiology,10.1101/305441,2,Kim  Hardie,University of Nottingham,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/305441v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/305441v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36815,Pseudomonas aeruginosa Can Inhibit Growth of Streptococcal Species via Siderophore Production,"Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes patients to accumulate thick, dehydrated mucus in the lung and develop chronic, polymicrobial infections due to reduced mucociliary clearance. These chronic polymicrobial infections and subsequent decline in lung function are significant factors in the morbidity and mortality of CF. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp. are among the most prevalent organisms in the CF lung; the presence of P. aeruginosa correlates with lung function decline and the Streptococcus milleri group (SMG), a subgroup of the viridans streptococci, is associated with exacerbations in patients with CF. Here we characterize the interspecies interactions that occur between these two genera. We demonstrated that multiple P. aeruginosa laboratory strains and clinical CF isolates promote the growth of multiple SMG strains and oral streptococci in an in vitro coculture system. We investigated the mechanism by which P. aeruginosa enhances growth of streptococci by screening for mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14 unable to enhance Streptococcus growth, and we identified the P. aeruginosa pqsL::TnM mutant, which failed to promote growth of S. constellatus and S. sanguinis. Characterization of the P. aeruginosa {Delta}pqsL mutant revealed that this strain cannot promote Streptococcus growth. Our genetic data and growth studies support a model whereby the P. aeruginosa {Delta}pqsL mutant overproduces siderophores, and thus likely outcompetes Streptococcus sanguinis for limited iron. We propose a model whereby competition for iron represents one important means of interaction between P. aeruginosa and Streptococcus spp.\n\nImportanceCystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections are increasingly recognized for their polymicrobial nature. These polymicrobial infections may alter the biology of the organisms involved in CF-related infections, leading to changes in growth, virulence and/or antibiotic tolerance, and could thereby affect patient health and response to treatment. In this study, we demonstrate interactions between P. aeruginosa and streptococci using a coculture model, and show that one interaction between these microbes is likely competition for iron. Thus, these data indicate that one CF pathogen may influence the growth of another and add to our limited knowledge of polymicrobial interactions in the CF airway.","Scott, J.; Li, K.; Filkins, L.; Zhu, B.; Kuchma, S.; Schwartzman, J.; O'toole, G.",2019-01-04,Microbiology,10.1101/307488,2,Jessie  Scott,Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/307488v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/307488v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/JB.00014-19
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,36885,Identification of a novel subfamily of bacterial AAT-fold basic amino acid decarboxylases and functional characterization of its first representative: Pseudomonas aeruginosa LdcA,"Polyamines are small amino-acid derived polycations capable of binding negatively charged macromolecules. Bacterial polyamines are structurally and functionally diverse, and are mainly produced biosynthetically by PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases referred to as LAOdcs (Lysine-Arginine-Ornithine decarboxylases). In a phylogenetically limited group of bacteria, LAOdcs are also induced in response to acid stress. Here, we performed an exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of the AAT-fold LAOdcs which showcased the ancestral nature of their short forms in Cyanobacteria and Firmicutes, and emergence of distinct subfamilies of long LAOdcs in Proteobacteria. We identified a novel subfamily of lysine decarboxylases, LdcA, ancestral in Betaproteobacteria and Pseudomortadaceae {Gammaproteobacteria). We analyzed the expression of LdcA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and uncovered its role, intimately linked to cadaverine production, in promoting growth and reducing persistence of this multidrug resistant human pathogen during carbenicillin treatment. Finally, we documented a certain redundancy in the function of the three main polyamines - cadaverine, putrescine and spermidine - in P. aeruginosa by demonstrating the link between their intracellular level, as well as the capacity of putrescine and spermidine to complement the growth phenotype of the IdcA mutant.","Carriel, D.; Garcia, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,37056,Broad-spectrum adaptive antibiotic resistance associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa mucin-dependent surfing motility,"Surfing motility is a novel form of surface adaptation exhibited by the nosocomial pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the presence of the glycoprotein mucin that is found in high abundance at mucosal surfaces especially the lungs of cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis patients. Here we investigated the adaptive antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa under conditions in which surfing occurs compared to cells undergoing swimming. P. aeruginosa surfing cells were significantly more resistant to several classes of antibiotics including aminoglycosides, carbapenems, polymyxins, and fluroquinolones. This was confirmed by incorporation of antibiotics into growth medium, which revealed a concentration-dependent inhibition of surfing motility that occurred at concentrations much higher than those needed to inhibit swimming. To investigate the basis of resistance, RNA-Seq was performed and revealed that surfing influenced the expression of numerous genes. Included amongst genes dysregulated under surfing conditions were multiple genes from the Pseudomonas resistome, which are known to affect antibiotic resistance when mutated. Screening transposon mutants in these surfing-dysregulated resistome genes revealed that several of these mutants exhibited changes in susceptibility to one or more antibiotics under surfing conditions, consistent with a contribution to the observed adaptive resistance. In particular, several mutants in resistome genes, including armR, recG, atpB, clpS, nuoB, and certain hypothetical genes such as PA5130, PA3576 and PA4292, showed contributions to broad-spectrum resistance under surfing conditions and could be complemented by their respective cloned genes. Therefore, we propose that surfing adaption led to extensive multidrug adaptive resistance as a result of the collective dysregulation of diverse genes.","Sun, E.; Gill, E. E.; Falsafi, R.; Yeung, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,37098,Multi-omics approach identifies novel pathogen-derived prognostic biomarkers in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream infection,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen that causes health-care associated blood stream infections (BSI). Although P. aeruginosa BSI are associated with high mortality rates, the clinical relevance of pathogen-derived prognostic biomarker to identify patients at risk for unfavorable outcome remains largely unexplored. We found novel pathogen-derived prognostic biomarker candidates by applying a multi-omics approach on a multicenter sepsis patient cohort. Multi-level Cox regression was used to investigate the relation between patient characteristics and pathogen features (2298 accessory genes, 1078 core protein levels, 107 parsimony-informative variations in reported virulence factors) with 30-day mortality. Our analysis revealed that presence of the helP gene encoding a putative DEAD-box helicase was independently associated with a fatal outcome (hazard ratio 2.01, p = 0.05). helP is located within a region related to the pathogenicity island PAPI-1 in close proximity to a pil gene cluster, which has been associated with horizontal gene transfer. Besides helP, elevated protein levels of the bacterial flagellum protein FliL (hazard ratio 3.44, p < 0.001) and of a bacterioferritin-like protein (hazard ratio 1.74, p = 0.003) increased the risk of death, while high protein levels of a putative aminotransferase were associated with an improved outcome (hazard ratio 0.12, p < 0.001). The prognostic potential of biomarker candidates and clinical factors was confirmed with different machine learning approaches using training and hold-out datasets. The helP genotype appeared the most attractive biomarker for clinical risk stratification due to its relevant predictive power and ease of detection.","Willmann, M.; Goettig, S.; Bezdan, D.; Macek, B.; Velic, A.; Marschal, M.; Vogel, W.; Flesch, I.; Markert, U.; Schmidt, A.; Kuebler, P.; Haug, M.; Javed, M.; Jentzsch, B.; Oberhettinger, P.; Schuetz, M.; Bohn, E.; Sonnabend, M.; Klein, K.; Autenrieth, I.; Ossowski, S.; Schwarz, S.; Peter, S.",2018-04-28,Microbiology,10.1101/309898,1,Matthias  Willmann,University of Tuebingen,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/309898v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/309898v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,37604,Combinatorial quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa allows for novel cheating strategies,"In the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing (QS) is a social trait that is exploitable by non-cooperating cheats. Previously it has been shown that by linking QS to the production of both public and private goods, cheats can be prevented from invading populations of cooperators and this has been termed  a metabolic incentive to cooperate. We hypothesized P. aeruginosa could evolve novel cheating strategies to circumvent private goods metabolism by rewiring its combinatorial response to two QS signals (3O-C12-HSL and C4-HSL). We performed a selection experiment that cycled P. aeruginosa between public and private goods growth media and evolved an isolate which rewired its control of cooperative protease expression from a synergistic (AND-gate) response to dual signal input, to a 3O-C12-HSL only response. We show that this isolate circumvents metabolic incentives to cooperate and acts as a combinatorial signaling cheat, with a higher fitness in competition with its ancestor. Our results show three important principles; first, combinatorial QS allows for diverse social strategies to emerge; second, that restrictions levied by private goods are not sufficient to explain the maintenance of cooperation in natural populations and third that modifying combinatorial QS responses could result in important physiological outcomes in bacterial populations.","Gurney, J.; Azimi, S.; Brown, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,37521,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa complement of lactate dehydrogenases enables use of D- and L-lactate and metabolic crossfeeding,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most common cause of chronic, biofilm-based lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Sputum from patients with CF has been shown to contain oxic and hypoxic subzones as well as millimolar concentrations of lactate. Here, we describe the physiological roles and expression patterns of P. aeruginosa lactate dehydrogenases in the contexts of different growth regimes. P. aeruginosa produces four enzymes annotated as lactate dehydrogenases, three of which are known to contribute to anaerobic or aerobic metabolism in liquid cultures. These three are LdhA, which reduces pyruvate to D-lactate during anaerobic survival, and LldE and LldD, which oxidize D-lactate and L-lactate, respectively, during aerobic growth. We demonstrate that the fourth enzyme, LldA, performs redundant L-lactate oxidation during growth in aerobic cultures in both a defined MOPS-based medium and synthetic CF sputum medium. However, LldA differs from LldD in that its expression is induced specifically by the L-enantiomer of lactate. We also show that all four enzymes perform functions in colony biofilms that are similar to their functions in liquid cultures. Finally, we provide evidence that the enzymes LdhA and LldE have the potential to support metabolic cross-feeding in biofilms, where LdhA can catalyze the production of D-lactate in the anaerobic zone that is then used as a substrate in the aerobic zone. Together, these observations further our understanding of the metabolic pathways that can contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival during CF lung infection.\n\nIMPORTANCELactate is thought to serve as a carbon and energy source during chronic infections. Sites of bacterial colonization can contain two enantiomers of lactate: the L-form, generally produced by the host, and the D-form, which is usually produced by bacteria including the pulmonary pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we characterize P. aeruginosas set of four enzymes that it can use to interconvert pyruvate and lactate, the functions of which depend on the availability of oxygen and specific enantiomers of lactate. We also show that anaerobic pyruvate fermentation triggers production of the aerobic D-lactate dehydrogenase in both liquid cultures and biofilms, thereby enabling metabolic cross-feeding of lactate over time and space between subpopulations of cells. These metabolic pathways could contribute to P. aeruginosa growth and survival in the lung.","Lin, Y.-C.; Cornell, W. C.; Price-Whelan, A.; Dietrich, L. E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,37805,RsmV a small non-coding regulatory RNA in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that sequesters RsmA and RsmF from target mRNAs,"The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa has distinct genetic programs that favor either acute or chronic virulence gene expression. Acute virulence is associated with twitching and swimming motility, expression of a type III secretion system (T3SS), and the absence of alginate, Psl, or Pel polysaccharide production. Traits associated with chronic infection include growth as a biofilm, reduced motility, and expression of a type VI secretion system (T6SS). The Rsm post-transcriptional regulatory system plays an important role in the inverse control of phenotypes associated with acute and chronic virulence. RsmA and RsmF are RNA-binding proteins that interact with target mRNAs to control gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Previous work found that RsmA activity is controlled by at least three small, non-coding regulatory RNAs (RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ). In this study, we took an in-silico approach to identify additional sRNAs that might function in the sequestration of RsmA and/or RsmF and identified RsmV, a 192 nt transcript with four predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites. RsmV is capable of sequestering RsmA and RsmF in vivo to activate translation of tssA1, a component of the T6SS, and to inhibit T3SS gene expression. Each of the predicted RsmA/RsmF consensus binding sites contribute to RsmV activity. Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays show that RsmF binds RsmV with >10-fold higher affinity than RsmY and RsmZ. Gene expression studies revealed that the temporal expression pattern of RsmV differs from RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ. These findings suggest that each sRNA may play distinct roles in controlling RsmA and RsmF activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe role of RsmF in post-transcriptional control of gene expression remains enigmatic. While numerous rsmA-dependent phenotypes are more pronounced in an rsmAF double mutant, deletion of rsmF alone has only modest effects. Understanding mechanisms that control RsmF activity will provide insight into additional roles for RsmF. In the current study we identify RsmV as an sRNA that controls RsmA and RsmF activity, and show that RsmV, RsmW, RsmY, and RsmZ are differentially expressed during growth.","Janssen, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38060,"Three enzymes and one substrate; regulation of flux through the glyoxylate shunt in the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","The glyoxylate shunt bypasses the oxidative decarboxylation steps of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, thereby conserving carbon skeletons for biosynthesis. The branchpoint between the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate shunt is therefore widely considered to be one of the most important junctions in the whole of microbial metabolism. In Escherichia coli, AceK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of the TCA cycle enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD), is necessary to redirect flux through the first enzyme of the glyoxylate shunt, isocitrate lyase (ICL). In contrast, Mycobacterial species lack AceK and employ a phosphorylation-insensitive isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) at the branchpoint. Flux partitioning here is controlled \""rheostatically\"" through cross-activation of IDH by the product of ICL activity, glyoxylate. However, the opportunistic human pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, expresses IDH, ICD, ICL and AceK. Here, we present the structure, kinetics and regulation of each branchpoint enzyme. We show that flux partitioning is coordinated through reciprocal regulation of the enzymes involved, beautifully linking carbon flux with the availability of key gluconeogenic precursors in a way that cannot be extrapolated from an understanding of the branchpoint enzymes in other organisms.","Crousilles, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38111,Alginate-regulating genes are identified in the clinical cystic fibrosis isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA2192,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that leads to a buildup of mucus in the lungs ideal for bacterial colonization. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa enters the CF lung, it undergoes a conversion from nonmucoid to mucoid; colonization by a mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa greatly increases mortality. The mucoid phenotype is due to the production of alginate. The regulator of alginate production is the AlgT/U sigma factor. The observed phenotypic conversion is due to a mutation in the mucA gene coding for an anti-sigma factor, MucA, which sequesters AlgT/U. This mucoid phenotype is unstable when the strains are removed from the lung as they acquire second-site mutations. This in vitro reversion phenomenon is utilized to identify novel genes regulating alginate production. Previously, second-site mutations were mapped to algT/U, algO, and mucP, demonstrating their role in alginate regulation. Most of these studies were performed using a non-CF isolate. It was hypothesized that second site mutations in a clinical strain would be mapped to the same genes. In this study, a clinical, hyper-mucoid P. aeruginosa strain PA2192 was used to study the reversion phenomenon. This study found that PA2192 has a novel mucA mutation which was named them mucA180 allele. Twelve colonies were sub-cultured for two weeks without aeration at room temperature in order to obtain nonmucoid suppressors of alginate production (sap). Only 41 sap mutants were stable for more than 48 hours -- a reversion frequency of 3.9% as compared to ~90% in laboratory strains showing that PA2192 has a stable mucoid phenotype. This phenotype was restored in 28 of the 41 sap mutants when complemented with plasmids harboring algT/U. Four of the sap mutants are complemented by algO. Sequence analyses of the algT/U mutants have found no mutations in the coding region or promoter leading to the hypothesis that there is another, as yet unidentified mechanism of alginate regulation in this clinical strain.","Colbert, B.; Kumari, H.; Pinon, A.; Frey, L.; Pandey, S.; Mathee, K.",2018-05-10,Microbiology,10.1101/319004,1,Kalai  Mathee,"Department of Human and Molecular Genetics, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/319004v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/319004v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38117,Glycosylation-associated dysregulation of pyocyanin production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Implications for quorum sensing regulation,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an important opportunistic pathogen associated with high mortality in pneumonia, sepsis, and cystic fibrosis. Lending to its ability to cause severe disease and death is its arsenal of virulence factors and host evasion tactics. In addition to various other regulatory systems, many of P. aeruginosas virulence factors are regulated by a population density dependent regulatory network known as quorum sensing (QS). Many regulatory systems are impacted by post-translational modifications of proteins. An underexplored physiological aspect of P. aeruginosa is its ability to glycosylate proteins and the subsequent impact of glycosylation on P. aeruginosa physiology and behavior. The goal of this study was to determine whether P. aeruginosa QS is regulated by glycosylation. Here we demonstrate that disruption of glycosylation dysregulates QS phenotypes, notably pyocyanin production, in P. aeruginosa PAO1. In this study, it was initially observed that deletion of the P. aeruginosa neuraminidase, PaNA, caused an increased production of pyocyanin in LB-Lennox broth compared to wildtype bacteria at identical population densities. To confirm that the increased pyocyanin production was due to QS, we performed induction experiments using 10% cell-free media harvested from overnight cultures. To determine whether the QS phenotype observed is specific to pseudaminic acid, the target of PaNA, or if it is a reflection of global changes in glycosylation, we measured QS in a library of mutant bacteria generated in an MPAO1 background containing transposon insertions in various glycosyl-associated enzymes. The pattern of dysregulated QS held true in these mutant strains as well. Overall these data indicate that in P. aeruginosa, glycosylation is an important determinant of QS.","Mcclinton, A.

We evaluated the morphology, chemical structure and wettability before and after UV photocrosslinking of the produced scaffolds. Results showed that the developed scaffolds presented hydrophilic properties after PEG and GelMA incorporation. Our developed scaffolds were thus able to significantly reduce gram-positive, negative, and MRSA bacteria. Furthermore, we performed a series of study for better mechanistic understanding of the scaffolds bactericidal activity through protein adsorption study and analysis of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In summary, we have demonstrated the design and generation of electrospun fibers with improved hydrophilicity and efficient bactericidal activity without the association of any antibiotics.","De-Paula, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38560,Bacterial plasma membrane is the main cellular target of silver nanoparticles in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNP) are widely used in consumer products, mostly due to their excellent antimicrobial properties. One of the well-established antibacterial mechanisms of AgNP is their efficient contact with bacteria and dissolution on cell membranes. To our knowledge, the primary mechanism of cell wall damage and the event(s) initiating bactericidal action of AgNP are not yet elucidated.\n\nIn this study we used a combination of different assays to reveal the effect of AgNP on i) bacterial envelope in general, ii) outer membrane (OM) and iii) on plasma membrane (PM). We showed that bacterial PM was the main target of AgNP in Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AgNP depolarized bacterial PM, induced the leakage of the intracellular K+, inhibited respiration and caused the depletion of the intracellular ATP. In contrast, AgNP had no significant effect on the bacterial OM. Most of the adverse effects on bacterial envelope and PM occurred within the seconds and in the concentration range of 7-160 M AgNP, depending on the bacteria and assay used, while irreversible inhibition of bacterial growth (minimal bactericidal concentration after 1-h exposure of bacteria to AgNP) occurred at 40 M AgNP for P. aeruginosa and at 320 M AgNP for E. coli.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis showed that AgNP were binding to P. aeruginosa but not to E. coli cells and were found inside the P. aeruginosa cells. Taking into account that AgNP did not damage OM, we speculate that AgNP entered P. aeruginosa via specific mechanism, e.g., transport through porins.","Bondarenko, O.; Mariliis Sihtmäe, M.; Kuzmiciova, J.; Rageliene, L.; Kahru, A.; Daugelavicius, R.",2018-05-15,Microbiology,10.1101/322727,1,Olesja  Bondarenko,National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/322727v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/322727v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38548,The multidrug resistance efflux pump MexCD-OprJ is a switcher of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing response,"Most antibiotic resistance genes acquired by human pathogens originate from environmental microorganisms. Therefore, understanding the additional functions of these genes, other than conferring antibiotic resistance, is relevant from an ecological point of view. We examined the effect that overexpression of the MexCD-OprJ multidrug efflux pump has in the physiology of the environmental opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overexpression of this intrinsic resistance determinant shuts down the P. aeruginosa quorum sensing (QS) response. Impaired QS response is due to the extrusion of 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ), the precursor of the Pseudomonas Quinolone Signal (PQS), leading to low PQS intracellular levels and reduced production of QS signal molecules. The P. aeruginosa QS response induces the expression of hundreds of genes, which can be costly unless such activation becomes beneficial for the bacterial population. While it is known that the QS response is modulated by population density, information on additional signals/cues that may alert the cells about the benefits of mounting the response is still scarce. It is possible that MexCD-OprJ plays a role in this particular aspect; our results indicate that, upon overexpression, MexCD-OprJ can act as a switcher in the QS population response. If MexCD-OprJ alleviate the cost associated to trigger the QS response when un-needed, it could be possible that MexCD-OprJ overproducer strains might be eventually selected even in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure, acting as antibiotic resistant cheaters in heterogeneous P. aeruginosa populations. This possibility may have potential implications for the treatment of P. aeruginosa chronic infections.","Alcalde-Rico, M.; Olivares Pacheco, J.; Alvarez-Ortega, C.; Camara, M.; Martinez, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38704,The Pseudomonas aeruginosa PilSR two-component system regulates both twitching and swimming motilities,"Motility is an important virulence trait for many bacterial pathogens, allowing them to position themselves in appropriate locations at appropriate times. Motility structures - pili and flagella - are also involved in sensing surface contact, which modulates pathogenicity. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the PilS-PilR two-component system (TCS) regulates expression of the type IV pilus (T4P) major subunit PilA, while biosynthesis of the single polar flagellum is regulated by a hierarchical system that includes the FleSR TCS. Previous studies in Geobacter sulfurreducens and Dichelobacter nodosus implicated PilR in regulation of non-T4P-related genes, including some involved in flagellar biosynthesis. Here we used RNAseq analysis to identify genes in addition to pilA with changes in expression in the absence of pilR. Among these were 10 genes inversely dysregulated by loss of pilA versus pilR, even though both pilA and pilR mutants lack T4P and pilus-related phenotypes. The products of those genes - many of which were hypothetical - may be important for virulence and surface-associated behaviours, as mutants had altered swarming motility, biofilm formation, type VI secretion, and pathogenicity in a nematode model. Further, the PilSR TCS positively regulated transcription of fleSR, and thus many genes in the FleSR regulon. As a result, pilSR deletion mutants had defects in swimming motility that were independent of the loss of PilA. Together these data suggest that in addition to controlling T4P expression, PilSR have a broader role in the regulation of P. aeruginosa motility and surface sensing behaviours.","Kilmury, S. L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,38893,Evolutionary highways to persistent bacterial infection,"Persistent infections require bacteria to evolve from their naive colonization state by optimizing fitness in the host. This optimization involves coordinated adaptation of multiple traits, obscuring evolutionary trends and complicating infection management. Accordingly, we screen 8 infection-relevant phenotypes of 443 longitudinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from 39 young cystic fibrosis patients over 10 years. Using statistical modeling, we map evolutionary trajectories and identify trait correlations accounting for patient-specific influences. By integrating previous genetic analyses of 474 isolates, we provide a window into early adaptation to the host, finding: 1) a 2-3 year timeline of rapid adaptation after colonization, 2) variant \""naive\"" and \""adapted\"" states reflecting discordance between phenotypic and genetic adaptation, 3) adaptive trajectories leading to persistent infection via 3 distinct evolutionary modes, and 4) new associations between phenotypes and pathoadaptive mutations. Ultimately, we effectively deconvolute complex trait adaptation, offering a framework for evolutionary studies and precision medicine in clinical microbiology.","Bartell, J. A.; Sommer, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,39175,Privatisation rescues function following loss of cooperation,"A single cheating mutant can lead to the invasion and eventual eradication of cooperation from a population. Consequently, cheat invasion is often considered as \""game over\"" in empirical and theoretical studies of cooperator-cheat dynamics, especially when cooperation is necessary for fulfilling an essential function. But is cheat invasion necessarily \""game over\"" in nature? By following a population of bacteria through loss of cooperation and beyond, we observed that individuals evolved to replace cooperation with a selfish, or \""private\"" behaviour. Specifically, we show that when cheating caused the loss of cooperative iron acquisition in a collection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients, a private uptake system that only benefits the focal individual was upregulated. This observation highlights the importance of social dynamics of natural populations and emphasizes the potential impact of past social interaction on the evolution of private traits.","Andersen, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,39021,Pseudomonas aeruginosa displays a dormancy phenotype during long-term survival in water.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of long-term survival in water, which may serve as a reservoir for infection. Although viable cell counts of PAO1 incubated in water remain stable throughout 8 weeks, LIVE/DEAD(R) staining indicated a high proportion of cells stained with propidium iodide (PI). The proportion of PI-stained cells increased by 4 weeks, then decreased again by 8 weeks, suggesting an adaptive response. This was also evident in an observed shift in cell morphology from a rod to a coccoid shape after 8 weeks. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to recover PI-stained cells, which were plated and shown to be viable, indicating that PI-stained cells were membrane-compromised but still cultivable. PAO1 mid-log cells in water were labeled with the dsDNA-binding dye PicoGreen(R) to monitor viability as well as DNA integrity, which demonstrated that the population remains viable and transitions towards increased dsDNA staining. Metabolic activity was found to decrease significantly in water by 4 weeks. The PAO1 outer membrane became less permeable and more resistant to polymyxin B damage in water, and the profile of total membrane lipids changed over time. None of the individual mutants within a library of ~2500 mapped, mini-Tn5-lux transposon mutants were found to have decreased survival in water. Among the ~1400 transcriptional lux fusions, gene expression in water revealed that the majority of genes were repressed, but subsets of genes were induced at particular time points. In summary, these results indicate that P. aeruginosa is dormant in water and this adaptation involves a complex pattern of gene regulation and changes to the cell to promote long-term survival and antibiotic tolerance. The approach of P. aeruginosa incubated in water may be useful to study antibiotic tolerance and the mechanisms of dormancy and survival in nutrient limiting conditions.","Lewenza, S.; Abboud, J.

We present an investigation based on linear free energy relationships (LFERs) and kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) of PAS and active site mutants that suggest a key role for leaving group (LG) stabilization. In LFERs wild type PAS has a much less negative Br0nsted coefficient ({beta}leaving groupobs-Enz = -0.33) than the uncatalyzed reaction ({beta}leavingroupobs = -1.81). This situation is diminished when cationic active site groups are exchanged for alanine. The considerable degree of bond breaking during the TS is evidenced by an 18Obridge KIE of 1.0088. LFER and KIE data for several active site mutants point to leaving group stabilization by active-site lysine K375, in cooperation with histidine H211. 15N KIEs combined with an increased sensitivity to leaving group ability of the sulfatase activity in neat D2O ({Delta}{beta}leaving groupH-D = +0.06) suggest that the mechanism for S-Obridge bond fission shifts, with decreasing leaving group ability, from charge compensation via Lewis acid interactions towards direct proton donation. 18Ononbridge KIEs indicate that the TS for PAS-catalyzed sulfate monoester hydrolysis has a significantly more associative character compared to the uncatalyzed reaction, while PAS-catalyzed phosphate monoester hydrolysis does not show this shift. This difference in enzyme-catalyzed TSs appears to be the major factor favoring specificity toward sulfate over phosphate in this promiscuous hydrolase, since other features are either too similar (uncatalyzed TS) or inherently favor phosphate (charge).","Van Loo, B.; Berry, R.; Boonyuen, U.; Mohamed, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,39462,Partitioning protein ParP directly links chemotaxis to biofilm dispersal in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"The recent characterization of partitioning proteins in the localization of chemotaxis signal transduction systems was proposed to have broad implications for polarly-flagellated non-enterobacteriaceae gamma-proteobacteria. These studies showed that the loss of either partitioning protein resulted in equivalent reductions in swimming motility and chemotaxis protein localization and inheritance. However, the role of these chemotaxis partitioning proteins outside of Vibrio spp. remains untested. Our studies on the chemotaxis partitioning proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed an unexpected role for the partitioning protein ParP. While the P. aeruginosa ParC and ParP homologs are needed for wild type swimming motility, the loss of ParP results in a greater swimming defect compared to the parC mutant. Our studies revealed that the Par-like proteins directly interact with each other and the chemotaxis system, and ParP interacts with DipA. Deletion of dipA results in a similar defect in swimming motility as the parP mutant. ParP has an interdependence for polar cluster formation, but not localization, with both CheA and DipA, and CheA cluster formation is partially dependent on ParP. Due to the direct interactions and interdependence of cluster formation of ParP and DipA, and the similar phenotypes of the parP and dipA mutants, further investigation into the role of ParP in biofilm dispersion is warranted.\n\nImportanceImpaired chemotaxis protein cluster formation or inheritance reduces chemotaxis which can have an impact on of the virulence of a bacterium. In some gamma-proteobacteria there are systems in place to ensure that chemotaxis proteins, like chromosomes and plasmids, are localized for optimal chemotaxis and that daughter cells inherit their own clusters for use after cell division. Par-like proteins have been implicated in the partitioning and localization of chemotaxis proteins and the chemotactic ability of Vibrio spp. and Rhodobacter sphaeroides [1-3]. We propose that Par-like proteins can do more than localize chemotaxis proteins to the poles of the cells. In P. aeruginosa, they bring together other key proteins involved in regulating flagellar-based motility, and we propose they function as a critical link between biofilm dispersal and motility.","Reinhardt, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,39800,Bidirectional alterations in antibiotics susceptibility in Staphylococcus aureus - Pseudomonas aeruginosa dual-species biofilm,"While in biofilms bacteria are embedded into an extracellular matrix which forms inaccessible barrier for antimicrobials thereby drastically increasing the concentrations of antibiotics required for treatment. Here we show that the susceptibility of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to antibiotics in mixed biofilms significantly differs from monoculture biofilms depending on both conditions and chosen antimicrobial agents. While S. aureus could completely avoid vancomycin, ampicillin and ceftriaxone by embedding into the biofilm of P. aeruginosa, the very same consortium was characterized by 10-fold increase in susceptibility to broad-spectrum antimicrobials like ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides compared to monocultures. These data clearly indicate that efficient treatment of biofilm-associated mixed infections requires antimicrobials active against both pathogens, since the interbacterial antagonism would enhance the efficacy of treatment. Moreover, similar increase in antibiotics efficacy was observed when P. aeruginosa suspension was added to the mature S. aureus biofilm, compared to S. aureus monoculture, and vice versa. These findings open promising perspectives to increase the antimicrobial treatment efficacy of the wounds infected with nosocomial pathogens by the transplantation of the skin residential microflora.","Kayumov, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,40512,Oxygen Restriction Generates Difficult-To-Culture Pathogens,"Induction of a non-culturable state has been demonstrated for many bacteria. In a clinical perspective, the lack of growth due to these non-culturable bacteria can have major consequences for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. Here we show how anoxic conditioning (restriction of molecular oxygen, O2) generates difficult-to-culture (DTC) bacteria during biofilm growth. A significant subpopulation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa entered a DTC state after anoxic conditioning, ranging from five to 90 % of the total culturable population, in both planktonic and biofilm models. Anoxic conditioning also generated DTC subpopulations of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Growth of the DTC populations were achieved by substituting O2 with 10 mM NO3- as an alternative electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration or, in the case of P. aeruginosa, by adding sodium pyruvate or catalase as scavengers against reactive oxygen species (ROS) during aerobic respiration. An increase in normoxic plating due to addition of catalase suggests the molecule hydrogen peroxide as a possible mechanism for induction of DTC P. aeruginosa. Anoxic conditioning also generated a true viable but non-culturable (VBNC) population of P. aeruginosa that was not resurrected by substituting O2 with NO3- during anaerobic respiration. Moreover, bacterial detection in clinical samples was improved significantly by supplementing 10 mM NO3- to LB plates and incubating under anoxic conditions. These results demonstrate that habituation to an infectious anoxic micro-environment complicates diagnostic culturing of bacteria, especially in the case of chronic infections where oxygen is restricted due to the host immune response.

ImportanceDiagnostics of bacteria from chronic infections by standard culture-based methods is challenging. Bacteria in a non-culturable state may contribute to the lack of culturing from these infections. Many stressors are known to induce a non-culturable state, among others the absence of molecular oxygen, which is evident in chronic infections due to high rates of oxygen consumption by the host response. In this study, we have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis can enter a difficult-to-culture state after oxygen restriction. Regrowth was not possible using conventional normoxic plating where oxygen served as electron acceptor. Instead, regrowth was enabled during anoxic conditions with added nitrate as alternative electron acceptor. Our findings show that bacteria can habituate to their environment and that it has to be taken into consideration especially when culturing clinical samples e.g. from chronic infections.","Kvich, L.; Fritz, B.; Crone, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,40578,Blocking the alternative sigma factor RpoN reduces virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis patients and increases antibiotic sensitivity in a laboratory strain,"Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are increasing in the health care setting, and there are few antimicrobial agents available to treat infections caused by these bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen in burn patients and individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), and a leading cause of nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa is inherently resistant to many antibiotics and can develop or acquire resistance to others, limiting options for treatment. P. aeruginosa has virulence factors that are regulated by sigma factors in response to the tissue microenvironment. The alternative sigma factor, RpoN ({sigma}54), regulates many virulence genes and is linked to antibiotic resistance. Recently, we described a cis-acting peptide, RpoN*, which acts as a \""molecular roadblock\"", binding RpoN consensus promoters at the -24 site and blocking transcription. RpoN* reduces virulence of P. aeruginosa laboratory strains both in vitro and in vivo, but its effects in clinical isolates was not known. We investigated the effects of RpoN* on phenotypically varied P. aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients. RpoN* expression reduced motility, biofilm formation, and pathogenesis in a P. aeruginosa - C. elegans infection model. RpoN* expression increased susceptibility to several beta-lactam based antibiotics in the lab strain P. aeruginosa PA19660 Xen5. Here, we show that using a cis-acting peptide to block RpoN consensus promoters has potential clinical implications in reducing virulence and enhancing the activity of antibiotics.","Lloyd, M.

For this cross-sectional study, 24 clinical isolates (included pus, urine, wound, and blood) were collected from two diagnostic centers in Chennai from May 2015 to February 2016. Biofilm formation was assessed using microtiter dish biofilm formation assay and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) were determined for planktonic and biofilm cells (MBC assay). Further, PCR amplification of biofilm-specific antibiotic resistance genes PA0756-0757, PA5033 and PA2070 were performed. Biofilm formation was found to be moderate/strong in 16 strains. MBC for planktonic cells showed that 4, 7, 10 and 14 strains were susceptible to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem and colistin respectively. In MBC assay for biofilm cells (MBC-B), all the 16 biofilm producing strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin whereas nine and four were resistant to meropenem, and colistin respectively. The biofilm-specific antibiotic-resistant genes PA0756-0757 was found in 10 strains, 6 strains with PA5033 and 9 strains with PA2070 that were found to be resistant phenotypically.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,41035,Rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa disperse the Biofilms of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria,"Biofilm formation is an important problem for many industries. Desulfovibrio vulgaris is the representative sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) which causes metal corrosion in oil wells and drilling equipment, and the corrosion is related to its biofilm formation. Biofilms are extremely difficult to remove since the cells are cemented in a polymer matrix. In an effort to eliminate SRB biofilms, we examined the ability of supernatants from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 to disperse SRB biofilms. We found that the P. aeruginosa supernatants dispersed more than 98% of the biofilm. To determine the genetic basis of this SRB biofilm dispersal, we examined a series of P. aeruginosa mutants and found that mutants rhlA, rhlB, rhlI, and rhlR, defective in rhamnolipids production, had significantly reduced levels of SRB biofilm dispersal. Corroborating these results, purified rhamnolipids dispersed SRB biofilms, and rhamnolipids were detected in the P. aeruginosa supernatants. Hence, P. aeruginosa supernatants disperse SRB biofilms via rhamnolipids. In addition, the supernatants of P. aeruginosa dispersed the SRB biofilms more readily than protease in M9 glucose minimum medium and were also effective against biofilms of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis.","Wood, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,41225,Stress-responsive and metabolic gene regulation are altered in low S-adenosylmethionine,"S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is the methyl donor that modifies proteins such as histones, nucleic acids and produces phosphatidylcholine. Thus variations in SAM levels could affect processes from lipogenesis to epigenetic gene regulation. SAM is hypothesized to link metabolism and chromatin modification, however, its role in acute gene regulation is poorly understood. We recently found that Caenorhabditis elegans with reduced SAM had deficiencies in bacterial-induced H3K4 trimethylation at selected pathogen-response genes, decreasing their expression and limiting survival on the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This led us to the hypothesis that SAM may be generally required stress-responsive transcription. Here we show that C. elegans with low SAM fail to activate genome-wide transcriptional programs when exposed to bacterial or xenotoxic stress. However, heat shock responses were unaffected. We also investigated the role of two H3K4 methyltransferases that use SAM, set-2/SET1, and set-16/MLL and found that set-2/SET1 has a specific requirement in bacterial stress responses, whereas set-16/MLL was required for survival in all three stresses. These results define a role for SAM and H3K4 methyltransferases in the acute genome-wide remodeling of gene expression in response to stress. Finally, we find that the ability to modify metabolic gene expression correlates with enhanced survival in stress conditions.","Ding, W.; Higgins, D. P.; Yadav, D. K.; Pukkila-Worley, R.; Walker, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,41909,Population dynamics and transcriptomic responses of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a complex laboratory microbial community,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the dominant species when it co-exists with many other bacterial species in diverse environments. To understand its physiology and interactions with co-existing bacterial species in different conditions, we established physiologically reproducible eighteen-species communities, and found that P. aeruginosa became the dominant species in mixed-species biofilm community but not in the planktonic community. P. aeruginosa H1 type VI secretion system was highly induced in the mixed-species biofilm community compare to its mono-species biofilm, which was further demonstrated to play a key role for P. aeruginosa to gain fitness over other bacterial species. In addition, the type IV pili and Psl exopolysaccharide were shown to be required for P. aeruginosa to compete with other bacterial species in the biofilm community. Our study showed that the physiology of P. aeruginosa is strongly affected by interspecies interactions, and both biofilm determinants and H1 type VI secretion system contribute to P. aeruginosa fitness over other species in complex biofilm communities.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa usually coexists with different bacterial species in natural environment. However, systematic comparative characterization of P. aeruginosa in complex microbial communities with its mono-species communities is lacking. We constructed mixed-species planktonic and biofilm communities consisting P. aeruginosa and seventeen other bacterial species to study the physiology and interaction of P. aeruginosa in complex multiple-species community. A single molecule detection platform, NanoString nCounter(R) 16S rRNA array, was used to shown that P. aeruginosa can become the dominant species in the biofilm communities while not in the planktonic communities. Comparative transcriptomic analysis and fluorescence-based quantification further revealed that P. aeruginosa H1 type VI secretion system and biofilm determinants are both required for its fitness in mixed-species biofilm communities.","Cheng, Y.; Yam, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,42194,Increased production of the extracellular polysaccharide Psl can give a growth advantage to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in low-iron conditions,"In infections, biofilm formation is associated with a number of fitness advantages, such as resistance to antibiotics and to clearance by the immune system. Biofilm formation has also been linked to fitness advantages in environments other than in vivo infections; primarily, biofilms are thought to help constituent organisms evade predation and to promote intercellular signaling. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilm infections in lungs, wounds, and on implants and medical devices. However, the tendency toward biofilm formation originated in this bacteriums native environment, primarily plants and soil. Such environments are polymicrobial and often resource-limited. Other researchers have recently shown that the P. aeruginosa extracellular polysaccharide Psl can bind iron. For the lab strain PA01, Psl is also the dominant adhesive and cohesive \""glue\"" holding together multicellular aggregates and biofilms. Here, we perform quantitative time-lapse confocal microscopy and image analysis of early biofilm growth by PA01. We find that aggregates of P. aeruginosa have a growth advantage over single cells of P. aeruginosa in the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in low-iron environments. Our results suggest the growth advantage of aggregates is linked to their high Psl content and to the production of an active factor by S. aureus. We posit that the ability of Psl to promote iron acquisition may have been linked to the evolutionary development of the strong biofilm-forming tendencies of P. aeruginosa.","Hutchison, J.; Kaushik, K.; Rodesney, C.; Lilieholm, T.; Bakhtiari, L.; Gordon, V.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,42309,The unsolved problem of otitis media in indigenous populations: A systematic review of upper respiratory and middle ear microbiota in indigenous children,"BackgroundOtitis media (OM) imposes a great burden of disease in indigenous populations around the world, despite a variety of treatment and prevention programs. Improved understanding of the pathogenesis of OM in indigenous populations is required to advance treatment and reduce prevalence. We conducted a systematic review of the literature exploring upper airway and middle ear microbiota in relation to OM in indigenous children.\n\nMethodsPapers targeting microbiota in relation to OM in children <18 years indigenous to Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Greenland were sought. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Informit databases were searched using key words. Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and then full-text papers against inclusion criteria according to PRISMA guidelines.\n\nResultsTwenty-five papers considering indigenous Australian, Alaskan and Greenlandic children were included. There were high rates of nasopharyngeal colonization with the three main otopathogens (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) in indigenous children with OM. Middle ear samples had lower rates of otopathogen detection, although detection rates increased when molecular methods were used. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were commonly detected in middle ear discharge of children with chronic suppurative OM. There was significant heterogeneity between studies, particularly in microbiological methods, which were largely limited to culture-based detection of the main otopathogens.\n\nConclusionsThere are high rates of otopathogen colonization in indigenous children with OM. Chronic suppurative OM appears to be associated with a different microbial profile. Beyond the main otopathogens, the data are limited. Further research is required to explore the entire upper respiratory tract/ middle ear microbiota in relation to OM, with the inclusion of healthy indigenous peers as controls.","Coleman, A.; Wood, A.; Bialasiewicz, S.; Ware, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43447,Genomic inversion drives small colony variant formation and increased virulence in P. aeruginosa,"Phenotypic change is a hallmark of bacterial adaptation during chronic infection. In the case of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, well-characterised phenotypic variants include mucoid and small colony variants (SCVs). It has previously been shown that SCVs can be reproducibly isolated from the murine lung following the establishment of chronic infection with mucoid P. aeruginosa strain NH57388A. Here we show, using a combination of singlemolecule real-time (PacBio) and Illumina sequencing that the genetic switch for conversion to the SCV phenotype is a large genomic inversion through recombination between homologous regions of two rRNA operons. This phenotypic conversion is associated with large-scale transcriptional changes distributed throughout the genome. This global rewiring of the cellular transcriptomic output results in changes to normally differentially regulated genes that modulate resistance to oxidative stress, central metabolism and virulence. These changes are of clinical relevance since the appearance of SCVs during chronic infection is associated with declining lung function.","Irvine, S.; Bunk, B.; Bayes, H.; Spröer, C.; Connolly, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,42724,Mutation-driven evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of either ceftazidime or ceftazidime/avibactam,"Ceftazidime/avibactam is a combination of beta-lactam/beta-lactamases inhibitor, which use is restricted to some clinical cases including cystic fibrosis patients infected with multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in which mutation is the main driver of resistance. This study aims to predict the mechanisms of mutation-driven resistance that are selected for when P. aeruginosa is challenged with either ceftazidime or ceftazidime/avibactam. For this purpose, P. aeruginosa PA14 was submitted to experimental evolution in the absence of antibiotics and in the presence of increasing concentrations of ceftazidime or ceftazidime/avibactam for 30 consecutive days. Final populations were analysed by whole-genome sequencing. All evolved populations reached similar levels of ceftazidime resistance. Besides, all of them were more susceptible to amikacin and produced pyomelanin. A first event in the evolution was the selection of large chromosomal deletions containing hmgA (involved in pyomelanin production), galU (involved in {beta}-lactams resistance) and mexXY-oprM (involved in aminoglycoside resistance). Besides mutations in mpl and dacB that regulate {beta}-lactamase expression, mutations related to MexAB-OprM overexpression were prevalent. Ceftazidime/avibactam challenge selected mutants in the putative efflux pump PA14_45890-45910 and in a two-component system (PA14_45870-45880), likely regulating its expression. All populations produce pyomelanin and were more susceptible to aminoglycosides likely due to the selection of large chromosomal deletions. Since pyomelanin-producing mutants, presenting similar deletions are regularly isolated from infections, the potential aminoglycosides hyper-susceptiblity and reduced {beta}-lactams susceptibility of pyomelanin-producing P. aeruginosa should be taken into consideration for treating infections by these isolates.","Sanz-Garcia, F.; Hernando-Amado, S.; Martinez, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,42970,Disentangling bacterial invasiveness from lethality in an experimental host-pathogen system,"Quantifying virulence remains a central problem in human health, pest control, disease ecology, and evolutionary biology. Bacterial virulence is typically quantified by the LT50 (i.e. the time taken to kill 50% of infected hosts), however, such an indicator cannot account for the full complexity of the infection process, such as distinguishing between the pathogens ability to colonize vs. kill the hosts. Indeed, the pathogen needs to breach the primary defenses in order to colonize, find a suitable environment to replicate, and finally express the virulence factors that cause disease. Here, we show that two virulence attributes, namely pathogen lethality and invasiveness, can be disentangled from the survival curves of a laboratory population of Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes exposed to three bacterial pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Salmonella enterica. We first show that the host population eventually experiences a constant mortality rate, which quantifies the lethality of the pathogen. We then show that the time necessary to reach this constant-mortality rate regime depends on the pathogen growth rate and colonization rate, and thus determines the pathogen invasiveness. Our framework reveals that Serratia marcescens is particularly good at the initial colonization of the host, whereas Salmonella enterica is a poor colonizer yet just as lethal once established. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, on the other hand, is both a good colonizer and highly lethal after becoming established. The ability to quantitatively characterize the ability of different pathogens to perform each of these steps has implications for treatment and prevention of disease and for the evolution and ecology of pathogens.","Biancalani, T.; Gore, J.",2018-07-04,Ecology,10.1101/361584,1,Jeff  Gore,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/361584v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/361584v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.15252/msb.20188707
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43325,Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibits Rhizopus microsporus germination through sequestration of free environmental iron,"Rhizopus spp are the most common etiological agents of mucormycosis, causing over 90% mortality in disseminated infection. Key to pathogenesis is the ability of fungal spores to swell, germinate, and penetrate surrounding tissues. Antibiotic treatment in at-risk patients increases the probability of the patient developing mucormycosis, suggesting that bacteria have the potential to control the growth of the fungus. However, research into polymicrobial relationships involving Rhizopus spp has not been extensively explored. Here we show that co-culturing Rhizopus microsporus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa results in the inhibition of spore germination. This inhibition was mediated via the secretion of bacterial siderophores, confirming the essential role of iron for fungal growth. Addition of P. aeruginosa siderophores to R. microsporus spores in the zebrafish larval model of infection resulted in inhibition of fungal germination and reduced host mortality. Therefore, during infection antibacterial treatment may relieve bacterial imposed nutrient restriction resulting in secondary fungal infections.","Kousser, C.; Clark, C.; Voelz, K.; Hall, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,44058,"γ-proteobacteria eject their polar flagella under nutrient depletion, retaining flagellar motor relic structures","Bacteria switch only intermittently to motile planktonic lifestyles under favourable conditions.

We show that these bacteria eject their flagella at the base of the flagellar hook when nutrients are depleted, leaving a relic of a former flagellar motor in the outer membrane. Subtomogram averages of the full motor and relic reveal that this is an active process, as a plug protein appears in the relic, likely to prevent leakage across their outer membrane. We show that this is a widespread phenomenon demonstrated by the appearance of relic structures in varied {gamma}-proteobacteria including Plesiomonas shigelloides, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio fischeri, Shewanella putrefaciens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.","Ferreira, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43617,Triflic acid treatment enables LC-MS/MS analysis of insoluble bacterial biomass,"The lysis and extraction of soluble bacterial proteins from cells is a common practice for proteomics analyses, but insoluble bacterial biomasses are often left behind. Here, we show that with triflic acid treatment, the insoluble bacterial biomass of Gram- and Gram+ bacteria can be rendered soluble. We use LC-MS/MS shotgun proteomics to show that bacterial proteins in the soluble and insoluble post-lysis fractions differ significantly. Additionally, in the case of Gram- Pseudomonas aeruginosa, triflic acid treatment enables the enrichment of cell envelope-associated proteins. Finally, we apply triflic acid to a human microbiome sample to show that this treatment is robust and enables the identification of a new, complementary subset of proteins from a complex microbial mixture.","Wang, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43827,The structural complexity of the Gammaproteobacteria flagellar motor is related to the type of its torque-generating stators,"The bacterial flagellar motor is a cell-envelope-embedded macromolecular machine that functions as a propeller to move the cell. Rather than being an invariant machine, the flagellar motor exhibits significant variability between species, allowing bacteria to adapt to, and thrive in, a wide range of environments. For instance, different torque-generating stator modules allow motors to operate in conditions with different pH and sodium concentrations and some motors are adapted to drive motility in high-viscosity environments. How such diversity evolved is unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography to determine the in situ macromolecular structures of the flagellar motors of three Gammaproteobacteria species: Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shewanella oneidensis MR-1, providing the first views of intact motors with dual stator systems. Complementing our imaging with bioinformatics analysis, we find a correlation between the stator system of the motor and its structural complexity. Motors with a single H+-driven stator system have only the core P- and L-rings in their periplasm; those with dual H+-driven stator systems have an extra component elaborating their P-ring; and motors with Na+- (or dual Na+-H+)- driven stator systems have additional rings surrounding both their P- and L-rings. Our results suggest an evolution of structural complexity that may have enabled pathogenic bacteria like L. pneumophila and P. aeruginosa to colonize higher-viscosity environments in animal hosts.","Kaplan, M.; Ghosal, D.; Subramanian, P.; Oikonomou, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43828,Stable sub-complexes observed in situ suggest a modular assembly pathway of the bacterial flagellar motor,"The self-assembly of cellular macromolecular machines such as the bacterial flagellar motor requires the spatio-temporal synchronization of gene expression, protein localization and association of a dozen or more unique components. In Salmonella and Escherichia coli, a sequential, outward assembly mechanism has been proposed for the flagellar motor starting from the inner membrane, with each subsequent component stabilizing the last. Here, using electron cryo-tomography of intact Legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shewanella oneidensis cells, we observe stable outer-membrane-embedded sub-complexes of the flagellar motor. These sub-complexes consist of the periplasmic embellished P- and L-rings, in the absence of other flagellar components, and bend the membrane inward dramatically. Additionally, we also observe independent inner-membrane sub-complexes consisting of the C- and MS-rings and export apparatus. These results suggest an alternate model for flagellar motor assembly in which outer- and inner-membrane-associated sub-complexes form independently and subsequently join, enabling later steps of flagellar production to proceed.","Kaplan, M.; Subramanian, P.; Ghosal, D.; Oikonomou, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,43865,Accelerated detection of Gram negative bacteria in blood culture by enhanced acoustic flow cytometry (AFC) following peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH),"Bacteraemia is a risk factor for subsequent clinical deterioration and death. Current reliance on culture-based methods for detection of bacteraemia delays identification and assessment of this risk until after the optimal period for positively impacting treatment decisions has passed. Therefore, a method for rapid detection and identification of bacterial infection in the peripheral bloodstream in acutely ill patients is crucial for improved patient survival through earlier targeted antibiotic treatment. The turnaround time for current clinical laboratory methods ranges from 12 to 48 hours, emphasizing the need for a faster diagnostic test. Here we describe a novel assay for accelerated detection of bacterial infection in blood culture (BC) using peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization enhanced acoustic flow cytometry (PNA-FISH-AFC). For assay development, we used simulated blood cultures (BCs) spiked with one of three bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa at a low concentration of 10 CFU/mL. Under current clinical settings, it takes a minimum of 12 hours incubation to reach positivity on the BacTEC system, corresponding to a bacterial concentration of 107-109 CFU/mL optimal for further analyses. In contrast, our PNA-FISH-AFC assay detected 103 - 104 CFU/mL bacteria in BC following a much shorter incubation of 5 to 10 hours in culture. Using either PCR-based FilmArray(R) assay or MALDI-TOF for bacterial detection, it took 7-10 and 12-24 hours of incubation, respectively, to reach the positive result. These findings indicate a potential time advantage of PNA-FISH-AFC assay over currently used laboratory techniques for rapid bacterial detection in BC with significantly improved turnaround time.","Huang, X.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,44008,A nucleus-like compartment shields bacteriophage DNA from CRISPR-Cas and restriction nucleases,"All viruses require strategies to inhibit or evade the immunity pathways of cells they infect. The viruses that infect bacteria, bacteriophages (phages), must avoid nucleic-acid targeting immune pathways such as CRISPR-Cas and restriction endonucleases to replicate efficiently1. Here, we show that a jumbo phage infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa, phage {Phi}KZ, is resistant to many immune systems in vivo, including CRISPR-Cas3 (Type I-C), Cas9 (Type II-A), Cas12 (Cpf1, Type V-A), and Type I restriction-modification (R-M) systems. We propose that {Phi}KZ utilizes a nucleus-like shell to protect its DNA from attack. Supporting this, we demonstrate that Cas9 is able to cleave {Phi}KZ DNA in vitro, but not in vivo and that Cas9 is physically occluded from the shell assembled by the phage during infection. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Achilles heel for this phage is the mRNA, as translation occurs outside of the shell, rendering the phage sensitive to the RNA targeting CRISPR-Cas enzyme, Cas13a (C2c2, Type VI-A). Collectively, we propose that the nucleus-like shell assembled by jumbo phages enables potent, broad spectrum evasion of DNA-targeting nucleases.","Mendoza, S. D.; Berry, J. D.; Nieweglowska, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,44215,A global genomic approach uncovers novel components for twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extremely successful pathogen able to cause both acute and chronic infections in a range of hosts, utilizing a diverse arsenal of cell-associated and secreted virulence factors. A major cell-associated virulence factor, the Type IV pilus (T4P), is required for epithelial cell adherence and mediates a form of surface translocation termed twitching motility, which is necessary to establish a mature biofilm and actively expand these biofilms. P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion is a coordinated, multicellular behaviour, allowing cells to rapidly colonize surfaces, including implanted medical devices. Although at least 44 proteins are known to be involved in the biogenesis, assembly and regulation of the T4P, with additional regulatory components and pathways implicated, it is unclear how these components and pathways interact to control these processes. In the current study, we used a global genomics-based random-mutagenesis technique, transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), coupled with a physical segregation approach, to identify all genes implicated in twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion in P. aeruginosa. Our approach allowed identification of both known and novel genes, providing new insight into the complex molecular network that regulates this process in P. aeruginosa. Additionally, our data suggests a differential effect on twitching motility by flagellum components based upon their cellular location. Overall the success of our TraDIS approach supports the use of this global genomic technique for investigating virulence genes in bacterial pathogens.","Nolan, L. M.; Whitchurch, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,44609,"Emergence of Multidrug-Resistant Uropathogens harboring ESBL, Carbapenem, Aminoglycosides and AmpC resistant genes from Northern India","Extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria acts as a serious threat, and its co-existence with other antibiotic resistant gene makes the clinical scenario worse nowadays. Therefore in this study, we investigated the occurrence of ESBL genes coexisting with carbapenem, AmpC and aminoglycoside resistance gene in uropathogens. Out of 1516 urine samples, 454 showed significant bacteriuria with a prevalence rate of 29.94 %. Escherichia coli (n=340) were found to be the most predominant uropathogen followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=92), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=10) and Proteus mirabilis (n=9). Among the total uropathogens, sixty-three ESBL-producers were identified which included blaCTX-M-15 (n=32), followed by blaCTX-M-15 + blaOXA-2 (n=15), blaCTX-M-15 + blaOXA-2 + blaTEM (n=6), blaOXA-2 (n=5), bla OXA-2 + bla SHV-76 (n=1), bla TEM+SHV-76 (n= 1) and bla TEM (n=1). All ESBL genes were found on plasmid incompatibility types: HI1, I1, FIA+FIB, FIA and Y and were horizontally transferable. Among 63 ESBL-producers, 59 isolates harboured carbapenem-resistant genes which included blaNDM-5 (n=48), blaNDM-5 + blaOXA-48 (n=5), blaNDM-5 + blaIMP (n=5) and blaNDM-5 + blaIMP + blaVIM (n=1). The ESBL producing uropathogens also harbored 16S rRNA methylase genes which included rmtB (n=9), rmtA (n=4), rmtC (n=1) and ArmA (n=1) followed by AmpC genes which includes CIT (n=8) and DHA-1 (n=1) genes. Imipenem and gentamicin were found to be more effective.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,44793,Evaluation of InSeq to Identify Genes Essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 Corn Root Colonization,"The reciprocal interaction between rhizosphere bacteria and their plant hosts results in a complex battery of genetic and physiological responses. In this study, we used insertion sequencing (INSeq) to reveal the genetic determinants responsible for the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 during root colonization. We generated a random transposon mutant library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PGPR2 comprising 39,500 unique insertions and identified genes required for growth in culture and on corn roots. A total of 108 genes were identified as contributing to the fitness of strain PGPR2 on roots. The importance in root colonization of four genes identified in the TnSeq screen was verified by constructing deletion mutants in the genes and testing them for the ability to colonize corn roots singly or in competition with the wild type. All four mutants were affected in corn root colonization, displaying 5-to 100-fold reductions in populations in single inoculations, and all were outcompeted by the wild type by almost 100-fold after seven days on corn roots in mixed inoculations of the wild type and mutant. The genes identified in the screen had homology to genes involved in amino acid catabolism, stress adaptation, detoxification, signal transduction, and transport. INSeq technology proved a successful tool to identify fitness factors in P. aeruginosa PGPR2 for root colonization.","Sivakumar, R.; Ranjani, J.; Vishnu, U. S.; Jayashree, S.; Lozano, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,46997,Increased rates of genomic mutation in a biofilm co-culture model of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus,"Biofilms are major contributors to disease chronicity and are typically multi-species in nature. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in a variety of chronic diseases but current in vitro dual-species biofilms models involving these pathogens are limited by short co-culture times (24 to 48 hours). Here, we describe the establishment of a stable (240 hour) co-culture biofilm model of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus that is reproducible and more representative of chronic disease.\n\nThe ability of two P. aeruginosa strains, (PAO1 and a cystic fibrosis isolate, PA21), to form co-culture biofilms with S. aureus was investigated. Co-culture was stable for longer periods using P. aeruginosa PA21 and S. aureus viability within the model improved in the presence of exogenous hemin. Biofilm co-culture was associated with increased tolerance of P. aeruginosa to tobramycin and increased susceptibility of S. aureus to tobramycin and a novel antimicrobial, HT61, previously shown to be more effective against non-dividing cultures of Staphylococcal spp. Biofilm growth was also associated with increased short-term mutation rates; 10-fold for P. aeruginosa and 500-fold for S. aureus.\n\nBy describing a reproducible 240 hour co-culture biofilm model of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, we have shown that interspecies interactions between these organisms may influence short-term mutation rates and evolution, which could be of importance in understanding the adaptive processes that lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance.","Frapwell, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,46020,Longitudinal Surveys Show that Urethral Catheters Harbor Recurrent Polymicrobial Biofilms with Cooperative and Competitive Behaviors Among Cohabitating Pathogens,"The analysis of catheter biofilms (CBs) from patients with neurogenic bladder disorders revealed persistent colonization by polymicrobial communities. The recurrence of bacterial species in the CBs of sequentially replaced catheters suggests urothelial reservoirs responsible for recolonization of the catheter surface. Proteomic data for CB samples were indicative of chronic inflammation in the patients urinary tracts via neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration and epithelial cell exfoliation. These host defense pathways, effective in killing pathogens during uncomplicated urinary tract infection, failed to eliminate CBs. Intermittent antibiotic drug treatment had different outcomes: either replacement of drug-susceptible by drug-tolerant bacteria or transient microbial biomass reduction followed by resurgence of the previously colonizing bacteria. Proteins that sequester iron and zinc such as lactotransferrin, lipocalin-2 and calprotectin were abundant in the patients CBs and urine sediments. Indicative of a host-pathogen battle for bivalent metal ions, acquisition and transport systems for such ions were highly expressed by many organisms residing in CBs. Species part of the Enterococcaceae and Aerococcaceae families, generally not well-characterized in their ability to synthesize siderophores, frequently cohabitated biofilms dominated by siderophore-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In support of metal acquisition cooperativity, we noticed positive abundance correlations for a Proteus mirabilis yersiniabactin-type siderophore system and two Enterococcus faecalis ABC transporters. Distinct bacterial strains highly expressed known or putative cytotoxins that appeared to compromise the survival of co-resident bacteria, e.g. a P. mirabilis hemolysin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa type 6 secretion and pyoverdin biosynthesis systems.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,46127,Killing from the inside: Intracellular role of T3SS in the fate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa within macrophages revealed by mgtC and oprF mutants,"While considered solely an extracellular pathogen, increasing evidence indicates that Pseudomonas aeruginosa encounters intracellular environment in diverse mammalian cell types, including macrophages. In the present study, we have deciphered the intramacrophage fate of wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain by live and electron microscopy. P. aeruginosa first resided in phagosomal vacuoles and subsequently could be detected in the cytoplasm, indicating phagosomal escape of the pathogen, a finding also supported by vacuolar rupture assay. The intracellular bacteria could eventually induce cell lysis. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently identified to be important for survival of P. aeruginosa in macrophages, were found to be involved in bacterial escape from the phagosome as well as cell lysis caused by intracellular bacteria. Strikingly, type III secretion system (T3SS) genes of P. aeruginosa were down-regulated within macrophages in both mgtC and oprF mutants. Concordantly, cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) level was increased in both mutants, providing a clue for negative regulation of T3SS inside macrophages. Consistent with the phenotypes and gene expression pattern of mgtC and oprF mutants, a T3SS mutant ({Delta}pscN) exhibited defect in phagosomal escape and macrophage lysis driven by internalized bacteria. Importantly, these effects appeared to be largely dependent on the ExoS effector, in contrast with the known T3SS-dependent, but ExoS independent, cytotoxicity caused by extracellular P. aeruginosa towards macrophages. Hence, our work highlights T3SS and ExoS, whose expression is modulated by MgtC and OprF, as key players in the intramacrophage life of P. aeruginosa, allowing internalized bacteria to evade macrophages.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ability of professional phagocytes to ingest and kill microorganisms is central to host defense and Pseudomonas aeruginosa has developed mechanisms to avoid being killed by phagocytes. While considered an extracellular pathogen, P. aeruginosa has been reported to be engulfed by macrophages in animal models. Here, we visualized the fate of P. aeruginosa within cultured macrophages, revealing macrophage lysis driven by intracellular P. aeruginosa. Two bacterial factors, MgtC and OprF, recently discovered to be involved in the intramacrophage survival of P. aeruginosa, appeared to play role in this cytotoxicity caused by intracellular bacteria. We provided evidence that type III secretion system (T3SS) gene expression is lowered intracellularly in mgtC and oprF mutants. We further showed that intramacrophage P. aeruginosa uses its T3SS, specifically the ExoS effector, to promote phagosomal escape and cell lysis. We thus describe a transient intramacrophage stage of P. aeruginosa that could contribute to bacterial dissemination.","Blanc-Potard, A.-B.; Garai, P.; Berry, L.; Moussouni, M.; Bleves, S.",2018-08-10,Microbiology,10.1101/389718,1,Anne-Béatrice  Blanc-Potard,CNRS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/389718v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/389718v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.ppat.1007812

Most CEGs of the MPFG class were encoded within class I integrons, which co-harbour genes conferring resistance to other antibiotics. The majority of the integrons werelocated within Tn3-like and composite transposons. A conserved attachment site could bepredicted for the MPFGclass ICEs. MPFTclass ICEs carried the CEGs within compositetransposons which were not associated with integrons.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,46857,"Characterization of L-serine deaminases, SdaA (PA2448) and SdaB (PA5379), and their potential role in Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis","Regardless of the site of infectivity, all pathogens require high energetic influxes. This energy is required to counterattack the host immune system and in the absence the bacterial infections are easily cleared by the immune system. This study is an investigation into one highly bioenergetic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involving the amino acid L-serine and the enzyme L-serine deaminase (L-SD). P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen causing infections in patients with compromised immune systems as well as patients with cystic fibrosis. L-SD has been linked directly to the pathogenicity of several organisms including but not limited to Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium bovis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Yersinia pestis. We hypothesized that P. aeruginosa L-SD is likely to be critical for its virulence. The genome sequence analysis revealed the presence of two L-SD homologs encoded by sdaA and sdaB. We analyzed the ability of P. aeruginosa to utilize serine and the role of SdaA and SdaB in serine deamination by comparing mutant strains of sdaA (PAOsdaA) and sdaB (PAOsdaB) with their isogenic parent P. aeruginosa PAO1. We demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is unable to use serine as a sole carbon source. However, serine utilization is enhanced in the presence of glycine. Both SdaA and SdaB contribute to L-serine deamination, 34 % and 66 %, respectively. Glycine was also shown to increase the L-SD activity especially from SdaB. Glycine-dependent induction requires the inducer serine. The L-SD activity from both SdaA and SdaB is inhibited by the amino acid L-leucine. These results suggest that P. aeruginosa L-SD is quite different from the characterized E. coli L-SD that is glycine-independent but leucine-dependent for activation. Growth mutants able to use serine as sole carbon source were isolated. In addition, suicide vectors were constructed which allow for selective mutation of the sdaA and sdaB genes on any P. aeruginosa strain of interest. Future studies with a double mutant will reveal the importance of these genes for pathogenicity.","Mathee, K.; Leal, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,46982,Defining the core essential genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Genomics offered the promise of transforming antibiotic discovery by revealing many new essential genes as good targets, but the results fell short of the promise. It is becoming clear that a major limitation was that essential genes for a bacterial species were often defined based on a single or limited number of strains grown under a single or limited number of in vitro laboratory conditions. In fact, the essentiality of a gene can depend on both genetic background and growth condition. We thus developed a strategy for more rigorously defining the core essential genome of a bacterial species by studying many pathogen strains and growth conditions. We assessed how many strains must be examined to converge on a set of core essential genes for a species. We used transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) to define essential genes in nine strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on five different media and developed a novel statistical model, FiTnEss, to classify genes as essential versus non-essential across all strain-media combinations. We defined a set of 321 core essential genes, representing 6.6% of the genome. We determined that analysis of 4 strains was typically sufficient in P. aeruginosa to converge on a set of core essential genes likely to be essential across the species across a wide range of conditions relevant to in vivo infection, and thus to represent attractive targets for novel drug discovery.","Poulsen, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,48587,Potential application of phage therapy for prophylactic treatment against Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm Infections.,"The majority of the microbial activity in humans is in the form of biofilms, i.e., an exopolysaccharide-enclosed bacterial mass. Unlike planktonic cells and the cells on the surface of the biofilm, the biofilm-embedded cells are more resistant to the effects of the antibiotics and the host cellular defense mechanisms. A combination of biofilm growth and inherent resistance prevents effective antibiotic treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections including those in patients with cystic fibrosis. Antibiotic resistance has led to an increasing interest in alternative modalities of treatment. Thus, phages that multiply in situ and in the presence of susceptible hosts can be used as natural, self-limiting, and profoundly penetrating antibacterial agents. The objective of this study is to identify active phages against a collection of P. aeruginosa isolates (PCOR strains) including the prototype PAO1 and the isogenic constitutively alginate-producing PDO300 strains. These PCOR strains were tested against six phages (P105, P134, P140, P168, P175B, and P182). The analysis shows 69 % of the PCOR isolates are sensitive and the rest are resistant to all six phages. These phages were then tested for their ability to inhibit biofilm formation using a modified biofilm assay. The analysis demonstrated that the sensitive strains showed increased resistance, but none of the susceptible strains from the initial screening were resistant. Using the minimum biofilm eradication concentration (MBEC) assay for biofilm formation, the biofilm eradication ability of the phages was tested. The data showed that a higher volume of phage was required to eradicate preformed biofilms than the amount required to prevent colonization of planktonic cells. This data supports the idea of phage therapy more as a prophylactic treatment.","Gurkar, A.; Balasubramanian, D.; Manur, J.; Mathee, K.",2018-09-09,Microbiology,10.1101/404145,1,Kalai  Mathee,Florida International University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/404145v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/404145v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,47830,Rapid detection of cytochrome cd1-containing nitrite reductase encoding gene nirS with loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"The cytochrome cd1-containing nitrite reductase, nirS, plays an important role in biological denitrification. Consequently, investigating the presence and abundance of nirS is a commonly used approach to understand the distribution and potential activity of denitrifying bacteria, in addition to denitrifier communities. Herein, a new molecular biology technique termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was developed to rapidly detect nirS gene using those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to optimize the assay. The LAMP assay relied on a set of four primers that were designed to recognize six target sequence sites, resulting in high target specificity. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by the lack of amplification when using DNA from 15 other bacterial species lacking nirS gene. The limit of detection for the LAMP assay under optimized conditions was 1.87 pg/reaction of genomic DNA, which was an order of magnitude lower than that required by conventional PCR assays. Moreover, a cell-template based LAMP assay was also developed for detecting nirS gene that directly used bacterial cells as template rather than genomic DNA. Only 1 h was needed from the addition of bacterial cells to the reaction to the verification of amplification success, and bulky and sophisticated equipment were not needed. Further, the nirS gene of P. aeruginosa in spiked seawater samples could be detected with both the DNA-template based LAMP assay and the cell-template based LAMP assay, thereby demonstrating the practicality of in-field use of them. In summary, the LAMP assays described here represent a rapid, user-friendly, and cost-effective alternative to conventional PCR.","Qu, K.; Zhang, X.; Yang, Q.; Jiang, X.; Wang, X.; Li, Y.; Zhao, J.; Hao, Z.; Wang, P.",2018-08-31,Microbiology,10.1101/404392,1,Keming  Qu,"Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/404392v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/404392v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41598-020-73304-9
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,47845,Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA5oct jumbo phage impacts planktonic and biofilm population and reduces its host virulence,"In this work we analyzed the impact of jumbo phage PA5oct on the planktonic, cell line adhered, and biofilm population of P. aeruginosa. PA5oct has a broad host-range, able to infect up to 40% of our clinical P. aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis (CF) collection. In the airway surface liquid (ASL) model, the infection of PA5oct effectively reduced the bacterial population both adhered to epithelial cells, mucus entrapped, and dispersed. The explanation for its infectivity can also be linked to the sensitization of infected bacteria to the innate immune mechanisms and pro-inflammatory effect. Interferometry of a 72-hour old biofilm highlighted the contribution of PA5oct in biofilm matrix degradation. Interestingly, two virion-associated proteins, gp162 and gp205, have been found as putative enzymes that can degrade matrix exopolysaccharides. Two third of biofilm clones developed PA5oct phage-resistance and the cross-resistance to both LPS- and pili-dependent phages. Simultaneously, all clones resistant to phage PA5oct maintain the phage DNA within the population, strongly reducing bacterial virulence in vivo. These properties can be considered as key parameters for the application of this bacterial virus in phage therapy settings.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThe emergence of phage-resistant mutants is a key aspect of lytic phages-bacteria interaction and the main driver for the co-evolution between both organisms. However, this fundamental property also has implications for bacterial eradication in phage therapy settings. Here, we analyze the impact of PA5oct jumbo phage treatment of planktonic/cell line associated and sessile P. aeruginosa population in a preclinical evaluation of this phage for therapeutic applications. Besides its broad-spectrum activity and efficient bacteria reduction in both airway surface liquid (ASL) model, and biofilm matrix degradation, PA5oct appears to persist in most of phage-resistant clones. Indeed, a high percentage of resistance (20/30 clones) to PA5oct is accompanied by the presence of phage DNA within bacterial culture. Moreover, the maintenance of this phage in the bacterial population is correlated to reduced P. aeruginosa virulence, coupled with a sensitization to innate immune mechanisms, and a significantly reduced growth rate. We observed rather unusual consequences of PA5oct infection causing an increased inflammatory response of monocytes to P. aeruginosa. This, phenomenon combined with the loss or modification of the phage receptor makes most of the phage-resistant clones significantly less pathogenic in in vivo model. During phage therapy treatment, phage-resistance is considered as an adverse effect, but our results indicate that it leads to diminished bacterial virulence and increased clearance of the infected host. These findings provide new insights into the general knowledge of giant phages biology and the impact of their application in phage therapy.","Olszak, T.; Danis-Wlodarczyk, K.; Arabski, M.; Gula, G.; Maciejewska, B.; Wasik, S.; Lood, C.; Higgins, G.; Harvey, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,47783,Alternative oxidase induction protects Candida albicans from respiratory stress and promotes hyphal growth,"The human fungal pathogen Candida albicans possesses two genes expressing a cyanide-insensitive Alternative Oxidase (Aox) enzymes in addition to classical and parallel electron transfer chains (ETC). In this study, we examine the role of Aox in C. albicans under conditions of respiratory stress, which may be inflicted during its interaction with the human host or co-colonising bacteria. We find that the level of Aox expression is sufficient to modulate resistance to classical ETC inhibition under respiratory stress and are linked to gene expression changes that can promote both survival and pathogenicity. For example we demonstrate that Aox function is important for the regulation of filamentation in C. albicans and observe that cells lacking Aox function lose virulence in a zebrafish infection model. Our investigations also identify that pyocyanin, a phenazine produced by the co-colonising bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, inhibits Aox-based respiration in C. albicans. These results suggest that Aox plays important roles within respiratory stress response pathways which C. albicans may utilise both as a commensal organism and as a pathogen.","Duvenage, L.; Walker, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,48340,Innolysins: A novel approach to engineer endolysins to kill Gram-negative bacteria,"Bacteriophage-encoded endolysins degrading the essential peptidoglycan of bacteria are promising alternative antimicrobials to handle the global threat of antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, endolysins have limited use against Gram-negative bacteria, since their outer membrane prevents access to the peptidoglycan. Here we present Innolysins, a novel concept for engineering endolysins that allows the enzymes to pass through the outer membrane, hydrolyse the peptidoglycan and kill the target bacterium. Innolysins combine the enzymatic activity of endolysins with the binding capacity of phage receptor binding proteins (RBPs). As our proof of concept, we used phage T5 endolysin and receptor binding protein Pb5, which binds irreversibly to the phage receptor FhuA involved in ferrichrome transport in Escherichia coli. In total, we constructed twelve Innolysins fusing endolysin with Pb5 or the binding domain of Pb5 with or without flexible linkers in between. While the majority of the Innolysins maintained their muralytic activity, Innolysin#6 also showed bactericidal activity against E. coli reducing the number of bacteria by 1 log, thus overcoming the outer membrane barrier. Using an E. coli fhuA deletion mutant, we demonstrated that FhuA is required for bactericidal activity, supporting that the specific binding of Pb5 to its receptor on E. coli is needed for the endolysin to access the peptidoglycan. Accordingly, Innolysin#6 was able to kill other bacterial species that carry conserved FhuA homologs such as Shigella sonnei and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In summary, the Innolysin approach expands recent protein engineering strategies allowing customization of endolysins by exploiting phage RBPs to specifically target Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe extensive use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria responsible for infections causing more than 50,000 deaths per year across Europe and the US. In response, the World Health Organization has stressed an urgent need to discover new antimicrobials to control in particular Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, due to their extensive multi-drug resistance. However, the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria limits the access of many antibacterial agents to their targets. Here, we developed a new approach, Innolysins that enable endolysins to overcome the outer membrane by exploiting the binding specificity of phage receptor binding proteins. As proof of concept, we constructed Innolysins against E. coli using the endolysin and the receptor binding protein of phage T5. Given the rich diversity of phage receptor binding proteins and their different binding specificities, our proof of concept paves the route for creating an arsenal of pathogen specific alternative antimicrobials.","Zampara, A.; Sorensen, M.

We also examined the role of SL in the human THP-1 macrophage-like cell line. SL effectively promoted receptor-mediated endocytosis and phagocytosis. Furthermore, SL accelerated the recruitment of Rac1 to the cell membrane, leading to the generation of reactive oxygen species for the elimination of phagocytosed bacteria. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of SL in breast milk and suggest its potential application as a therapeutic agent to treat bacterial and viral infections.","Kim, J.; Kim, Y.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,48994,A multidrug resistant clinical P. aeruginosa isolate in the MLST550 clonal complex: uncoupled quorum sensing modulates the interplay of virulence and resistance,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent and pernicious pathogen equipped with both extraordinary capabilities to infect the host and to develop antimicrobials resistance (AMR). Monitoring the emergence of AMR high risk clones and understanding the interplay of their pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance is of paramount importance to avoid resistance dissemination and to control P. aeruginosa infections. In this study, we report the identification of a multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa strain PA154197 isolated from a blood stream infection in Hong Kong. PA154197 belongs to a distinctive MLST550 clonal complex shared by two international P. aeruginosa isolates VW0289 and AUS544. Comparative genome and transcriptome analysis with the reference strain PAO1 led to the identification of a variety of genetic variations in antibiotic resistance genes and the hyper-expression of three multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM, MexEF-OprN, and MexGHI-OpmD in PA154197. Unlike many resistant isolates displaying an attenuated virulence, PA154197 produces a significantly high level of the P. aeruginosa major virulence factor pyocyanin (PYO) and displays an uncompromised virulence compared to PAO1. Further analysis revealed that the secondary quorum sensing system Pqs which primarily controls the PYO production is hyper-active in PA154197 independent of the master QS systems Las and Rhl. Together, these investigations disclose a unique, uncoupled QS mediated pathoadaptation mechanism in clinical P. aeruginosa which may account for the high pathogenic potentials and antibiotics resistance in the MDR isolate PA154197.","Cao, H.; Xia, T.; Li, Y.; Xu, Z.; Bougouffa, S.; Lo, Y.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,48863,Reconciling high-throughput gene essentiality data with metabolic network reconstructions,"The identification of genes essential for bacterial growth and survival represents a promising strategy for the discovery of antimicrobial targets. Essential genes can be identified on a genome-scale using transposon mutagenesis approaches; however, variability between screens and challenges with interpretation of essentiality data hinder the identification of both condition-independent and condition-dependent essential genes. To illustrate the scope of these challenges, we perform a large-scale comparison of multiple published Pseudomonas aeruginosa gene essentiality datasets, revealing substantial differences between the screens. We then contextualize essentiality using genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions and demonstrate the utility of this approach in providing functional explanations for essentiality and reconciling differences between screens. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions also enable a high-throughput, quantitative analysis to assess the impact of media conditions on the identification of condition-independent essential genes. Our computational model-driven analysis provides mechanistic insight into essentiality and contributes novel insights for design of future gene essentiality screens and the identification of core metabolic processes.\n\nAuthor SummaryWith the rise of antibiotic resistance, there is a growing need to discover new therapeutic targets to treat bacterial infections. One attractive strategy is to target genes that are essential for growth and survival.

We performed a large-scale comparison of multiple gene essentiality screens of the microbial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We implemented a computational model-driven approach to provide functional explanations for essentiality and reconcile differences between screens.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,49332,Efficient transposon mutagenesis mediated by an IPTG-controlled conditional suicide plasmid,"BackgroundTransposon mutagenesis is highly valuable for bacterial genetic and genomic studies. The transposons are usually delivered into host cells through conjugation or electroporation of a suicide plasmid. However, many bacterial species cannot be efficiently conjugated or transformed for transposon saturation mutagenesis. For this reason, temperature-sensitive (ts) plasmids have also been developed for transposon mutagenesis, but prolonged incubation at high temperatures to induce ts plasmid loss can be harmful to the hosts and lead to enrichment of mutants with adaptive genetic changes. In addition, the ts phenotype of a plasmid is often strain- or species-specific, as it may become non-ts or suicidal in different bacterial species.\n\nResultsWe have engineered several conditional suicide plasmids that have a broad host range and whose loss is IPTG-controlled. One construct, which has the highest stability in the absence of IPTG induction, was then used as a curable vector to deliver hyperactive miniTn5 transposons for insertional mutagenesis. Our analyses show that these new tools can be used for efficient and regulatable transposon mutagenesis in Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baylyi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In P. aeruginosa PAO1, we have used this method to generate a Tn5 insertion library with an estimated diversity of ~108, which is ~2 logs larger than the best transposon insertional library of PAO1 and related Pseudomonas strains previously reported.\n\nConclusionWe have developed a number of IPTG-controlled conditional suicide plasmids. By exploiting one of them for transposon delivery, a highly efficient and broadly useful mutagenesis system has been developed. As the assay condition is mild, we believe that our methodology will have broad applications in microbiology research.","Guo, H.; Naorem, S. S.; Han, J.; Zhang, S. Y.; Zhang, J.; Graham, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,49486,Multiple Toll-Spätzle Pathways in Drosophila melanogaster Immunity,"The Drosophila melanogaster Toll-Spatzle pathway plays an important role in development and immunity. Drosophila genome encodes nine Toll receptors and six Spatzle (Spz) proteins, and only the canonical Toll-Spz (Toll-1-Spz-1) pathway has been well investigated. In this study, we compared the nine Drosophila Tolls and showed that similarly to Toll, Toll-7 also strongly activated drosomycin promoter. Importantly, we showed that both Toll and Toll-7 interacted with Spz, Spz-2 and Spz-5, and co-expression of Toll or Toll-7 with Spz, Spz-2 and Spz-5 activated the drosomycin promoter. Furthermore, Toll and Toll-7 both recognized vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) by binding to the VSV glycoprotein. Septic infection in Toll and Toll-7 mutant flies suggested that Toll and Toll-7 differentially affected defense responses in adult males and females after systemic infection by Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans or VSV.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,49601,The essential role of hypermutation in rapid adaptation to antibiotic stress,"A common outcome of antibiotic exposure in patients and in vitro is the evolution of a hypermutator phenotype that enables rapid adaptation by pathogens. While hypermutation is a robust mechanism for rapid adaptation, it requires trade-offs between the adaptive mutations and the more common \""hitchhiker\"" mutations that accumulate from the increased mutation rate. Using quantitative experimental evolution, we examined the role of hypermutation in driving adaptation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to colistin. Metagenomic deep sequencing revealed 2,657 mutations at > 5% frequency in 1,197 genes and 761 mutations in 29 end point isolates. By combining genomic information, phylogenetic analyses, and statistical tests, we showed that evolutionary trajectories leading to resistance could be reliably discerned. In addition to known alleles such as pmrB, hypermutation allowed identification of additional adaptive alleles with epistatic relationships. Although hypermutation provided a short-term fitness benefit, it was detrimental to overall fitness. Alarmingly, a small fraction of the colistin adapted population remained colistin susceptible and escaped hypermutation. In a clinical population, such cells could play a role in re-establishing infection upon withdrawal of colistin. We present here a framework for evaluating the complex evolutionary trajectories of hypermutators that applies to both current and emerging pathogen populations.\n\nImportance\n\nBacteria can increase mutation rates in response to stress as an evolutionary strategy to avoid extinction. However, the complex mutational landscape of hypermutators makes it difficult to distinguish truly adaptive mutations from hitchhikers that follow similar evolutionary trajectories. We provide a framework for evaluating the complex evolutionary trajectories of hypermutators that can be applied to both current and emerging pathogen populations. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa evolving to colistin as a model system, we examine the essential role of hypermutation in the evolution of resistance. Additionally, our results highlight the presence of a subset of cells that survive and remain susceptible during colistin exposure which can serve as a reservoir for re-infection upon withdrawal of the drug in clinical infections. This study provides a broad understanding of hypermutation during adaptation and describes a series of analyses that will be useful in identifying adaptive mutations in well annotated and novel bacterial mutator populations.","Mehta, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,49707,"The dormancy-specific regulator, SutA, is intrinsically disordered and modulates transcription initiation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Though bacteria in nature are often nutritionally limited and growing slowly, most of our understanding of core cellular processes such as transcription comes from studies in a handful of model organisms doubling rapidly under nutrient-replete conditions. We previously identified a small protein of unknown function, called SutA, in a global screen of proteins synthesized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa under growth arrest (Babin BM, et al. (2016) SutA is a bacterial transcription factor expressed during slow growth in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PNAS 113(5):E597-605). SutA binds RNA polymerase (RNAP), causing widespread changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. Here, using biochemical and structural methods, we examine how SutA interacts with RNAP and the functional consequences of these interactions. We show that SutA consists of a central -helix with unstructured N- and C-terminal tails, and binds to the {beta}1 domain of RNAP. It activates transcription from the P. aeruginosa rrn promoter by both the housekeeping sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}70) and the general stress response sigma factor holoenzyme (E{sigma}S) in vitro, and its N-terminal tail is required for activation in both holoenzyme contexts. However, we find that the interaction between SutA and each holoenzyme is distinct, with the SutA C-terminal tail and an acidic loop unique to {sigma}70 playing the determining roles in these differences. Our results add SutA to a growing list of transcription regulators that use their intrinsically disordered regions to remodel transcription complexes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCELittle is known about how bacteria regulate their activities during periods of dormancy, yet growth arrest dominates bacterial existence in most environments and is directly relevant to the problem of physiological antibiotic tolerance. Though much is known about transcription in the model organism, Escherichia coli, even there, our understanding of gene expression during dormancy is incomplete. Here we explore how transcription under growth arrest is modulated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by the small acidic protein, SutA. We show that SutA binds to RNA polymerase and controls transcription by a mechanism that is distinct from other known regulators. Our work underscores the potential for fundamental, mechanistic discovery in this important and understudied realm of bacterial physiology.","Bergkessel, M.; Babin, B. M.; Vandervelde, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,50556,Ethanol decreases Pseudomonas aeruginosa flagellar motility through a cyclic-di-GMP- and stator-dependent pathway,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently encounters microbes that produce bioactive metabolites including ethanol. At concentrations that do not affect growth, we found that ethanol reduces P. aeruginosa motility by 30% in a swim agar assay and this decrease is accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in levels of cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a second messenger that represses motility, in planktonic cells. A screen of mutants lacking genes involved in c-di-GMP metabolism identified SadC and GcbA as diguanylate cyclases involved in swim zone reduction by ethanol and ethanol-induced c-di-GMP production. The reduction of swimming in response to ethanol also required the stator set, MotAB, two PilZ-domain proteins (FlgZ and PilZ), PilY1-a proposed surface-sensing protein, and PilMNOP, which comprises the pilus alignment complex and these proteins have been previously implicated in the control of motility on agar surfaces. Microscopic analysis of the fraction of quiescent cells in swim medium showed that ethanol decreased the portion of motile cells in the wild type, but had opposite effects in the {triangleup}pilY1, {triangleup}pilMNOP, {triangleup}motAB, and {triangleup}pilZ{triangleup}flgZ mutants. Together, these data indicate ethanol induces a regulated change in motility in planktonic cells at concentrations similar to those produced by other microbes. We propose that this ethanol-responsiveness may contribute to the co-localization of P. aeruginosa with ethanol-producing microbes.","Lewis, K. A.; Baker, A. E.; Chen, A. I.; Harty, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,51044,Hfq-assisted RsmA regulation is central to Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm polysaccharide PEL expression,"Expression of biofilm-associated genes is controlled by multiple regulatory elements, allowing bacteria to appropriately switch between sessile and motile lifestyles. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the post-transcriptional regulator RsmA has been implicated in the control of various genes including those related to biofilms, but much of the evidence for these links is limited to transcriptomic and phenotypic studies. RsmA binds to target mRNAs to modulate translation by affecting ribosomal access and/or mRNA stability. Here we trace a global regulatory role of RsmA to the inhibition of Vfr - a transcription factor that controls a transcriptional regulator FleQ. FleQ directly controls biofilm-associated genes that encode the PEL polysaccharide biosynthesis machinery.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,52583,Supra-molecular organization of the pyoverdine bio-synthetic pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"The biosynthesis of the pyoverdine siderophore in Pseudomonas aeruginosa inlvolves multiple enzymes including Non-Ribosomal Peptide Synthetases (NRPS). We used in vitro single-molecule tracking and FRET-FLIM (Forster resonance energy transfer measured by fluorescence lifetime microscopy) to explore the spatial partitioning of the ornithine hydroxylase PvdA and to characterize its interactions with NRPS. The statistical description of thousands of single PvdA traces in cells using jump distance distribution analysis showed PvdA was mostly diffusing bound to large complex in the cytoplasm with a small exchangeable trapped fraction diffusing slower. FRET-FLIM clearly showed PvdA are physically interacting with the four NRPS PvdJ, PvdI, PvdL and PvdD of the pyoverdine pathway in the cellular context. Our data provide evidence for strongly organized multi-enzymatic biosynthetic complexes named siderosomes responsible for the siderophore biosynthesis. PvdA binding mode is strikingly different according to the NRPS it is interacting with suggesting PvdA binding site have co-evolved with the enzymatic active sites of NRPS.","Gasser, V.; Malrieu, M.; Forster, A.; Mely, Y.; Schalk, I.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,51818,Type III secretion system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects mucin gene expression via NF-κB and AKT signaling in human carcinoma epithelial cells and a pneumonia mouse model,"The type III secretion system (T3SS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been linked to severe disease and poor clinical outcomes in animal and human studies. Of the various T3SS effector genes, ExoS and ExoT showed mutually exclusive distributions, and these two genes showed varied virulence. We aimed to investigate whether the ExoS and ExoT effector proteins of P. aeruginosa affect the expression of the proinflammatory mediators Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 via the NF-{kappa}B and AKT signaling pathways. To understand the role of the T3SS, we used AExoS, AExoT, and T3SS transcriptional activator ExsA mutants (ExsA::{Omega}), as well as A549 cells stimulated with P. aeruginosa strain K (PAK). We investigated the effects of {Delta}ExoS, {Delta}ExoT, and ExsA::{Omega} on the development of pneumonia in a mouse model and on Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 production in A549 cells. {Delta}ExoS and {Delta}ExoT markedly decreased the neutrophil count in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, with a reduction in Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression {Delta}ExoS and{Delta}ExoT reduced NF-{kappa}B and AKT phosphorylation, together with Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression in PAK-infected mice and A549 cells. In conclusion, P. aeruginosa infection induced the expression of Mucus, and the P. aeruginosa T3SS appeared to be a key player in Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression, which is further controlled by NF-{kappa}B and AKT signaling. These findings might be useful to devise a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of chronic pulmonary infections by targeting ExoS and ExoT.\n\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram-negative bacterium causing serious infections. Many clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa have a specialized apparatus for injecting toxins into eukaryotic cells, namely, the type III secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is a syringe-like apparatus on the bacterial surface, with 4 effector toxins: ExoS, ExoT, ExoY, and ExoU. We investigated the effect of ExoS and ExoT of the T3SS of P. aeruginosa K strain (PAK). Mucus plays a vital role in protecting the lungs from environmental factors, but conversely, in muco-obstructive airway disease, mucus becomes pathologic. We showed that infection with ExoS and ExoT induced Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 expression in host cells. PAK clinical strains induce proinflammatory cytokine production through the T3SS, and this involves NF-{kappa}B and SP1/AKT activation in pneumonia mouse models. Mucus induction in response to ExoS and ExoT infection relied on NF-{kappa}B and SP1/AKT activation. Our findings highlight the roles of Muc7, Muc13, Muc15, and Muc19 in inducing proinflammatory cytokine expression during ExoS and ExoT exposure in PAK infections, paving the way for a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of pulmonary infections.","Park, J.-W.; Shin, I.-S.; Oh, S.-R.; Ha, U.-H.; Ahn, K.-S.",2018-10-12,Microbiology,10.1101/442061,1,Kyung-Seop  Ahn,Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/442061v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/442061v1.full.pdf,cc_by,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,52168,Two-component systems regulate swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14,"Swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a quorum-dependant motility over semi-solid surfaces. On soft agar, P. aeruginosa exhibits a dendritic swarm pattern, with multiple levels of branching. Swarm patterns vary considerably depending upon the experimental design. In the present study, we show that the swarm pattern is plastic and media dependent. We define several quantifiable, macroscale features of the swarm to study the plasticity observed across media. Further, through a targeted screen of 113 genes encoding two-component system (TCS) components, we show that 44 TCS genes regulate PA14 swarming in a contextual fashion. However, only four TCS genes are essential for swarming. Many swarming-defective TCS mutants are highly efficient in biofilm formation indicating an antagonistic relationship between swarming and biofilm states in P. aeruginosa.","Joge, S.; Kollaran, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,52799,Comparative mode of action of antimicrobial peptide melimine and its derivative Mel4 against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Melimine and Mel4 are chimeric cationic peptides with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, and recent investigations have shown that they are highly biocompatible with animal model and human clinical trials. The current study examined the mechanism of action of these two antimicrobial peptides against P. aeruginosa with a series of investigations. Antimicrobial activities were determined by MIC and MBC. Endotoxin neutralization was determined using the LAL assay, effect on the cytoplasmic membrane was evaluated using DiSC(3)-5 and Sytox green stains, and Syto-9 and PI dyes using flow cytometry. Release of cytoplasmic materials (ATP and DNA/RNA) were determined using ATP luminescence and increase in OD260nm. The ability to lyse bacteria was studied by measuring a decrease in OD620nm. The MIC of the peptides remained low against P. aeruginosa strains, which showed efficient neutralization of LPS, indicating their role in the anti-pseudomonas and LPS binding activities. Both AMPs rapidly (starting at 30 seconds) depolarized P. aeruginosa cytoplasmic membrane leading to reduction in viability. Melimine was responsible for more ATP release (75%) compared to Mel4 (36%) (P<0.001) following two minutes exposure. For both peptides, Sytox green entered cells after five minutes of incubation. Flow cytometry demonstrated that both the AMPs permeabilized the cell membrane at 30 minutes and followed by increasing permeability. Similar results were found with DNA/RNA release experiments. Overall, melimine showed higher ability of membrane disruption, cell lysis compared to Mel4 (P<0.001). Knowledge regarding mechanism of action of these two AMPs would be helpful in making them as anti-pseudomonas drug.","Yasir, M.; Dutta, D.; Willcox, M. D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53019,Insertion sequences drive the emergence of a highly adapted human pathogen,"Taxonomic outliers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa of environmental origin have recently emerged as infectious for humans. Here we present the first genome-wide analysis of an isolate that caused fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia. We demonstrate that, in two sequential clones, CLJ1 and CLJ3, recovered from a patient with chronic pulmonary disease, insertion of a mobile genetic element into the P. aeruginosa chromosome affected major virulence-associated phenotypes and led to increased resistance to antibiotics used to treat the patient. Comparative proteome and transcriptome analyses revealed that this insertion sequence, ISL3, disrupted genes encoding flagellar components, type IV pili, O-specific antigens, translesion polymerase and enzymes producing hydrogen cyanide. CLJ3 possessed seven fold more IS insertions than CLJ1, some modifying its susceptibility to antibiotics by disrupting the genes for the outer-membrane porin OprD and the regulator of {beta}-lactamase expression AmpD. In the Galleria mellonella larvae model, the two strains displayed different levels of virulence, with CLJ1 being highly pathogenic. This work reveals ISs as major players in enhancing the pathogenic potential of a P. aeruginosa taxonomic outlier by modulating both, the virulence and the resistance to antimicrobials, and explains the ability of this bacterium to adapt from the environment to a human host.","Sentausa, E.; Basso, P.; Berry, A.; Adrait, A.; Bellement, G.; Coute, Y.; Lory, S.; Elsen, S.; Attree, I.",2018-10-25,Microbiology,10.1101/452334,1,Ina  Attree,CNRS,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/452334v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/452334v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1099/mgen.0.000265
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53042,Universal antibiotic tolerance arising from antibiotic-triggered accumulation of redox metabolites,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that often infects open wounds or patients with cystic fibrosis. Once established, P. aeruginosa infections are notoriously difficult to eradicate. This difficulty is in part due to the ability of P. aeruginosa to tolerate antibiotic treatment at the individual-cell level or through collective behaviors. Here we describe a new mechanism by which P. aeruginosa tolerates antibiotic treatment by modulating its global cellular metabolism. In particular, treatment of P. aeruginosa with sublethal concentrations of antibiotics covering all major classes promoted accumulation of the redox-sensitive phenazine - pyocyanin (PYO). PYO in turn conferred general tolerance against diverse antibiotics for both P. aeruginosa and other Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We show that PYO promotes energy generation to enhance the activity of efflux pumps, leading to enhanced antibiotic tolerance. This property is shared by other redox-active phenazines produced by P. aeruginosa. Our discovery sheds new insights into the physiological functions of phenazines and has implications for designing effective antibiotic treatment protocols.\n\nAuthor SummaryAntibiotic tolerance can facilitate the evolution of resistance, and here we describe a previously unknown mechanism of collective antibiotic tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In particular, P. aeruginosa treated with sublethal concentrations of antibiotics covering all major classes promotes accumulation of pyocyanin (PYO), an important virulence factor. In turn, PYO confers general tolerance against diverse antibiotics for both P. aeruginosa and other bacteria.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53221,Structure reveals mechanism of CRISPR RNA-guided nuclease recruitment and anti-CRISPR viral mimicry,"Bacteria and archaea have evolved sophisticated adaptive immune systems that rely on CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided detection and nuclease-mediated elimination of invading nucleic acids. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the type I-F CRISPR RNA-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bound to a double-stranded DNA target. Comparison of this structure to previously determined structures of this complex reveals a I180-degree rotation of the C-terminal helical bundle on the \""large\"" Cas8f subunit. We show that the dsDNA-induced conformational change in Cas8f exposes a Cas2/3 \""nuclease recruitment helix\"" that is structurally homologous to a virally encoded anti-CRISPR protein (AcrIF3). Structural homology between Cas8f and AcrIF3 suggests that AcrIF3 is a mimic of the Cas8f \""nuclease recruitment helix\"", implying that cas genes may sometimes serve as genetic fodder for the evolution of anti-CRISPRs.","Rollins, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53535,Outpatient prescribing of four major antibiotic classes and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in US adults,"BackgroundThere is limited information on the relation between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance in the US.\n\nMethodsWe used multivariable logistic regression to relate state-specific rates of outpatient prescribing overall for fluoroquinolones, penicillins, macrolides, and cephalosporins between 2011-2014 to state-specific prevalence of resistance for select combinations of antibiotics/bacteria among catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in the CDC Patient Safety Atlas data between 2011-2014 for adults aged 65+y and 19-64y, adjusting for potential confounders.\n\nResultsRates of fluoroquinolone prescribing were positively associated with prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (both age groups), resistance to extended-spectrum (ES) cephalosporins in E. coli (aged 19-64y), and resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus aureus (aged 19-64y). Rates of penicillin prescribing were positively associated with prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli (aged 65+) and P. aeruginosa (both age groups), and resistance to ES cephalosporins in Klebsiella spp. (both age groups). Rates of cephalosporin prescribing were negatively associated with prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli and resistance to ES cephalosporins in Klebsiella spp. (both age groups). Average annual temperature was positively associated with prevalence of resistance to ES cephalosporins in E. coli and P. aeruginosa, and resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that prescribing of fluoroquinolones and penicillins to US adults is associated with prevalence of antibiotic resistance, including ESBLs and MRSA.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53711,Antibacterial activity of total flavonoids from Ilex rotunda Thunb. and different antibacterials on different multidrug-resistant bacteria alone or in combination,"The problem of bacterial resistance is becoming more and more serious, which has become an urgent problem to be solved in human and veterinary. One approach to control and delay bacterial resistance is combination therapy in which antibiotics are given together with other antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial agents. Studies have shown that flavonoids from Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) possess a high level of antibacterial activity against antibiotic resistant strains. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial effects of a combined therapy of total flavonoids from Ilex rotunda Thunb. and antibiotics against seven kinds of veterinary bacteria which were multidrug resistance bacteria. A microdilution checkerboard method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations of both types of antimicrobials, alone and in combination. The fractional inhibitory concentration index was calculated and used to classify observed collective antibacterial activity as synergistic, additive, indifferent or antagonistic.\n\nFrom the performed tests, the total flavonoids and antimicrobial agents were combined to inhibit different multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii. For these bacteria, total flavonoids from Ilex Rotunda Thunb. presented synergistic or additive with different antibiotics and had a certain antibacterial effect on the separated multidrug-resistant bacteria. The study shows total flavonoids from Ilex rotunda Thunb. have potential as adjuvants for the treatment of animal bacterial diseases.","Wu, Y.; Chai, B.; Wang, L.; Jiang, W.; Hu, M.; Zhao, Y.; Si, H.",2018-10-31,Microbiology,10.1101/457911,1,Hongbin  Si,Guangxi University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457911v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457911v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,53690,Stochastic bacterial population dynamics prevent the emergence of antibiotic resistance from single cells,"A better understanding of how antibiotic exposure impacts the evolution of resistance is crucial for designing more sustainable treatment strategies. The conventional approach to relating antibiotic dose to resistance evolution within a bacterial population is to measure the range of concentrations over which resistant strain(s) are selectively favoured over a sensitive strain - the ""mutant selection window"". Here, we instead investigate how antibiotic concentration impacts the initial establishment of resistance from single cells, mimicking the clonal expansion of a resistant lineage following mutation or horizontal gene transfer. Using two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains carrying distinct resistance plasmids, we show that single resistant cells have <5% probability of outgrowth at antibiotic concentrations as low as 1/8th of the resistant strains minimum inhibitory concentration. This low probability of establishment is due to detrimental effects of antibiotics on resistant cells, coupled with the inherently stochastic nature of cell division and death on the single-cell level, which leads to loss of many nascent resistant lineages. Our findings suggest that moderate doses of antibiotics, within the traditional mutant selection window, may be more effective at preventing de novo emergence of resistance than predicted by deterministic approaches.

Significance statementThe emergence of antibiotic resistance poses a critical threat to the efficacy of antibiotic treatments. A resistant bacterial population must originally arise from a single cell that mutates or acquires a resistance gene. This single cell may, by chance, fail to successfully reproduce before it dies, leading to loss of the nascent resistant lineage. Here we show that antibiotic concentrations that selectively favour resistance are nonetheless sufficient to reduce the chance of outgrowth from a single cell to a very low probability. Our findings suggest that lower antibiotic concentrations than previously thought may be sufficient to prevent, with high probability, emergence of resistance from single cells.","Alexander, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,54260,Architectural principles for Hfq/Crc-mediated regulation of gene expression,"The global regulator Hfq facilitates the action of regulatory RNAs in post-transcription gene regulation in many Gram-negative bacteria. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Hfq, in conjunction with the catabolite repression protein Crc, was shown to form a complex that directly inhibits translation of target transcripts during carbon catabolite repression. Here, we describe and validate high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the cooperative assembly of Hfq and Crc bound to a translation initiation site. The core assembly is formed through interactions of two cognate RNAs, two Hfq hexamers and a Crc pair. Additional Crc protomers can be recruited to form higher-order assemblies with demonstrated in vivo activity. The structures indicate a distinctive RNA conformation and a pattern of repeating motifs that confer regulatory function. This study not only reveals for the first time how Hfq cooperates with a partner protein to regulate translation but also provides a novel structural basis to explain how an RNA code can guide global regulators to interact cooperatively and regulate many different RNA targets.","Luisi, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,54887,Global transcriptional regulation of innate immunity in C. elegans,"The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has emerged as a genetically tractable animal host in which to study evolutionarily conserved mechanisms of innate immune signaling. We previously showed that the PMK-1 p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway regulates innate immunity of C. elegans through phosphorylation of the CREB/ATF bZIP transcription factor, ATF-7. Here, we have undertaken a genomic analysis of the transcriptional response of C. elegans to infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining genome-wide expression analysis by RNA-seq with ATF-7 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq). We observe that PMK-1-ATF-7 activity regulates a majority of all genes induced by pathogen infection, and observe ATF-7 occupancy in regulatory regions of pathogen-induced genes in a PMK-1-dependent manner. Moreover, functional analysis of a subset of these ATF-7-regulated pathogen-induced target genes supports a direct role for this transcriptional response in host defense. The genome-wide regulation through PMK-1- ATF-7 signaling reveals global control over the innate immune response to infection through a single transcriptional regulator in a simple animal host.\n\nAuthor SummaryInnate immunity is the first line of defense against invading microbes across metazoans. Caenorhabditis elegans lacks adaptive immunity and is therefore particularly dependent on mounting an innate immune response against pathogens. A major component of this response is the conserved PMK-1/p38 MAPK signaling cascade, the activation of which results in phosphorylation of the bZIP transcription factor ATF-7. Signaling via PMK-1 and ATF-7 causes broad transcriptional changes including the induction of many genes that are predicted to have antimicrobial activity including C-type lectins and lysozymes. In this study, we show that ATF-7 directly regulates the majority of innate immune response genes upon pathogen infection of C. elegans, and demonstrate that many ATF-7 targets function to promote pathogen resistance.","Fletcher, M.; Tillman, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,55485,Identifying the drivers of computationally detected correlated evolution among sites under antibiotic selection,"The ultimate causes of correlated evolution among sites in a genome remain difficult to tease apart. To address this problem directly, we performed a high-throughput search for correlated evolution among sites associated with resistance to a fluoroquinolone antibiotic using whole genome data from clinical strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, before validating our computational predictions experimentally. We show that for at least two sites, this correlation is underlain by epistasis. Our analysis also revealed eight additional pairs of synonymous substitutions displaying correlated evolution underlain by physical linkage, rather than selection associated with antibiotic resistance. Our results provide direct evidence that both epistasis and physical linkage among sites can drive the correlated evolution identified by high throughput computational tools. In other words, the observation of correlated evolution is not by itself sufficient evidence to guarantee that the sites in question are epistatic; such a claim requires additional evidence, ideally coming from direct estimates of epistasis, based on experimental evidence.","Dench, J.; Hinz, A.; Aris-Brosou, S.; Kassen, R.",2019-10-15,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/474536,4,Jonathan  Dench,University of Ottawa,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/474536v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/474536v4.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1111/eva.12900
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,55733,Refinement of metabolite detection in cystic fibrosis sputum reveals heme negatively correlates with lung function,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (1, 2). Our laboratory has studied a class of small molecules produced by P. aeruginosa known as phenazines, including pyocyanin and its biogenic precursor phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). As phenazines are known virulence factors (3), we and others have explored the possibility of using phenazine concentrations as a marker for disease progression (4-6). Previously, we reported that sputum concentrations of pyocyanin and PCA negatively correlate with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients (6). Our study used high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify phenazines by UV-vis absorbance after extraction from lung sputum. Since our initial study, methods for metabolite analysis have advanced considerably, aided in large part by usage of mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Because a more recent study employing LC-MS/MS revealed a surprising decoupling of P. aeruginosa metabolites in sputum and the detection of P. aeruginosa through culturing or microbiome profiles (4), we decided to check whether we could reproduce our previous findings by analyzing sputum samples from a different patient cohort with a new LC-MS instrument in our laboratory. Our new samples were provided by the Mountain West CF Consortium Sputum Biomarker study (7). In the course of performing our new analyses, comparison of our old HPLC data to our new LC-MS data led us to realize that the peak previously assigned to PCA instead originates from heme, and the peak assigned to pyocyanin originates from an as-yet unknown compound. This correction only affects the measurements of phenazines in sputum, and we are confident in the phenazine measurements from isolated cultures and the 16S rRNA gene sequencing data from that study (6). Here we outline the basis for our correction and present additional data showing that heme concentration negatively correlates with lung function in cystic fibrosis patients.","Glasser, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,55754,"Proteomic analysis of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa iron starvation response reveals PrrF sRNA-dependent regulation of amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis, motility, and zinc homeostasis","Iron is a critical nutrient for most microbial pathogens, and the innate immune system exploits this requirement by sequestering iron and other metals through a process termed nutritional immunity. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa provides a model system for understanding the microbial response to host iron depletion, as this organism exhibits a high requirement for iron as well as an exquisite ability to overcome iron deprivation during infection. Hallmarks of P. aeruginosas iron starvation response include the induction of multiple high affinity iron acquisition systems and an \""iron sparing response\"" that is post-transcriptionally mediated by the PrrF small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Here, we used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to conduct label-free proteomics of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response, revealing several iron-regulated processes that have not been previously described. Iron starvation induced multiple proteins involved in branched chain and aromatic amino acid catabolism, providing the capacity for iron-independent entry of carbons into the TCA cycle. Proteins involved in sulfur assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis were reduced upon iron starvation, while proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis were paradoxically increased, highlighting the central role of iron in P. aeruginosa metabolism. Iron starvation also resulted in changes in the expression of several zinc-responsive proteins, as well as the first experimental evidence for increased levels of twitching motility proteins upon iron starvation. Subsequent proteomics analyses demonstrated that the PrrF sRNAs were required for iron regulation of many of these newly-identified proteins, and we identified PrrF complementarity with mRNAs encoding key iron-regulated proteins involved in amino acid metabolism, iron-sulfur biogenesis, and zinc homeostasis. Combined, these results provide the most comprehensive view of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response to date and outline novel roles for the PrrF sRNAs in the P. aeruginosa iron sparing response and pathogenesis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIron is central for the metabolism of almost all microbial pathogens, and as such this element is sequestered by the host innate immune system to restrict microbial growth. Defining the response of microbial pathogens to iron starvation is therefore critical for understanding how pathogens colonize and propagate within the host. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes significant morbidity and mortality in compromised individuals, provides an excellent model for studying this response due to its high requirement for iron yet well-documented ability to overcome iron starvation. Here we used label-free proteomics to investigate the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response, revealing a broad landscape of metabolic and metal homeostasis changes that have not previously been described. We further provide evidence that many of these processes are regulated through the iron responsive PrrF small regulatory RNAs, which are integral to P. aeruginosa iron homeostasis and virulence. These results demonstrate the power of proteomics for defining stress responses of microbial pathogens, and they provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of the P. aeruginosa iron starvation response.","Nelson, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,55879,Psittacid Adenovirus-2 infection in the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogastor): A key threatening process or an example of a host-adapted virus?,"Psittacid Adenovirus-2 (PsAdv-2) was identified in captive orange-bellied parrots (Neophema chrysogastor) during a multifactorial cluster of mortalities at the Adelaide Zoo, South Australia, and an outbreak of Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicaemia at the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment captive breeding facility, Taroona, Tasmania. This was the first time that an adenovirus had been identified in orange-bellied parrots and is the first report of PsAdv-2 in Australia. To investigate the status of PsAdv-2 in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots, 102 healthy birds from five breeding facilities were examined for the presence of PsAdv-2 DNA in droppings and/or cloacal swabs using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Additionally, eight birds released to the wild for the 2016 breeding season were similarly tested when they were recaptured prior to migration to be held in captivity for the winter. PsAdv-2 was identified in all breeding facilities as well as the birds recaptured from the wild. Prevalence of shedding ranged from 29.7 to 76.5%, demonstrating that PsAdv-2 is endemic in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots and that wild parrots may have been exposed to the virus. PsAdv-2 DNA was detected in both cloacal swabs and faeces of the orange-bellied parrots, but testing both samples from the same birds suggested that testing faeces would be more sensitive than cloacal swabs. PsAdv-2 was not found in other psittacine species housed in nearby aviaries at the Adelaide Zoo. The source of the infection in the orange-bellied parrots remains undetermined. In this study, PsAdv-2 prevalence of shedding was higher in adult birds as compared to birds less than one year old. Preliminary data also suggested a correlation between adenovirus shedding prevalence within the breeding collection and chick survival.","Yang, N.; Mclelland, J.; Mclelland, D.; Clarke, J.; Woolford, L.; Eden, P.; Phalen, D.",2018-11-26,Epidemiology,10.1101/479360,1,David  Phalen,The University of Sydney,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/479360v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/479360v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0208674

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,56348,Flagellar stators stimulate c-di-GMP production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Flagellar motility is critical for surface attachment and biofilm formation in many bacteria. A key regulator of flagellar motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other microbes is cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). High levels of this second messenger repress motility and stimulate biofilm formation. C-di-GMP levels regulate motility in P. aeruginosa in part by influencing the localization of its two flagellar stator sets, MotAB and MotCD. Here we show that just as c-di-GMP can influence the stators, stators can impact c-di-GMP levels. We demonstrate that the swarming motility-driving stator MotC physically interacts with the transmembrane region of the diguanylate cyclase SadC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction is capable of stimulating SadC activity. We propose a model by which the MotCD stator set interacts with SadC to stimulate c-di-GMP production in conditions not permissive to motility. This regulation implies a positive feedback loop in which c-di-GMP signaling events cause MotCD stators to disengage from the motor; then disengaged stators stimulate c-di-GMP production to reinforce a biofilm mode of growth. Our studies help define the bidirectional interactions between c-di-GMP and the motility machinery.\n\nImportance.The ability of bacterial cells to control motility during early steps in biofilm formation is critical for the transition to a non-motile, biofilm lifestyle. Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the ability of c-di-GMP to control motility via a number of mechanisms, including through controlling transcription of motility-related genes and modulating motor function. Here we provide evidence that motor components can in turn impact c-di-GMP levels. We propose that communication between motor components and c-di-GMP synthesis machinery allows the cell to have a robust and sensitive switching mechanism to control motility during early events in biofilm formation.","Baker, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,56672,Experimental evolution of independent genetic pathways for resistance to Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenicity within the nematode Caenorhabditis remanei,"Pathogenic host-microbe interactions can result from continuous evolution of a hosts ability to resist infection and a pathogens ability to survive and replicate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile and opportunistic pathogen, ubiquitous in the environment, and capable of damaging plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates. Previous studies in nematodes suggest that the pathogenic effects of P. aeruginosa can result from multiple distinct pathways: a toxin-based effect that kills within a few hours and a generalized virulence that kills over the course of multiple days. Using experimental evolution in the highly polymorphic nematode Caenorhabditis remanei, we show that nematode resistance to the two modes of pathogenesis in P. aeruginosa evolves through genetically independent pathways. These results demonstrate that multiple virulence patterns in a pathogen can result in multiple responses in the host, and the genetic lines established here create resources for further exploration of the genetic basis for resistance to P. aeruginosa.","Archer, H.; Phillips, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,56926,"Prospects of using Avocado oil for attenuating quorum sensing regulated virulence, bio-filming formation and its antibacterial and antioxidant activities","ABSTRCTQuorum sensing inhibition (QSI) is considered as an attractive strategy for the development of anti-pathogenic agents, mainly for drug resistant bacteria. The anti-quorum sensing activity was investigated by biosensor bioassay using Chromobacterium violaceum CVO26 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Quorum sensing is a key regulator of virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa such as bio-film formation, motility, productions of proteases, hemolysin, and Pyocyanin production. Additionally, the GC/MS technique was employed to detect the essential components of avocado oil. Avocado oil inhibits quorum system-mediated virulence factor production such as violacein in C. Violaceum CVO26 and elastase, Pyocyanin production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Additionally, the use of sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of avocado oil significantly inhibits the quorum system-mediated biofilm formation, exopolysaccride production (EPS) and swarming motility. Furthermore, this study concerned the potent activity of avocado oil antibacterial and antioxidant agent. Moreover, a total of 23 components was identified in avocado oil by GC/MS.Avocado oil could be exploited as a natural source of anti-pathogenic, where the pathogenicity is mediated through quorum sensing, antibacterial as well as antioxidant agents.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/486928_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f44fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f9f371org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ddc15aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c136a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","Hanan, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,57135,In vivo microscopy reveals the impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa social interactions on host colonization,"Pathogenic bacteria engage in social interactions to colonize hosts, which include quorum-sensing-mediated communication and the secretion of virulence factors that can be shared as \""public goods\"" between individuals. While in-vitro studies demonstrated that cooperative individuals can be displaced by \""cheating\"" mutants freeriding on social acts, we know little about social interactions in infections. Here, we developed a live imaging system to track virulence factor expression and social strain interactions in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonizing the gut of Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that shareable siderophores and quorum-sensing systems are expressed during infections, affect host gut colonization, and benefit nonproducers. However, non-producers were unable to cheat and outcompete producers, probably due to the spatial segregation of strains within the gut. Our results shed new light on bacterial social interactions in infections and reveal potential limits of therapeutic approaches that aim to capitalize on social dynamics between strains for infection control.","Rezzoagli, C.; Granato, E.; Kuemmerli, R.",2019-03-20,Microbiology,10.1101/488262,3,Chiara  Rezzoagli,University of Zurich (Switzerland),https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/488262v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/488262v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41396-019-0442-8
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,57212,Dietary protein mediates terminal investment in egg quantity or quality following bacterial gut infection in Drosophila,"Organisms have evolved a range of behavioural and physiological responses which minimize the impact of infection on fitness. When future reproductive potential is threatened, for example, as a result of pathogenic infection, the terminal investment hypothesis predicts that individuals will respond by investing preferentially in current reproduction. Terminal investment involves reallocating resources to current reproductive effort, so it is likely to be influenced by the quantity and quality of resources acquired through diet. Dietary protein specifically has been shown to impact both immunity and reproductive output in a range of organisms, but its impact on terminal investment during infection is unclear. We tested the effect of dietary protein on terminal investment in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster following oral exposure to the opportunist bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Oral exposure to bacteria triggered an increase in reproductive investment, but we find that the nature of the terminal investment strategy depended on the level of dietary protein. Flies feeding on a high protein diet increased the number of eggs laid when exposed to P. aeruginosa, while flies fed an isocaloric, lower protein diet did not increase the number of eggs laid but instead showed an increase in egg-to-adult viability following infection. We discuss the importance of considering diet and natural routes of infection when measuring non-immunological defenses.","Hudson, A. L.; Moatt, J. P.; Vale, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,57399,Tracking Pseudomonas aeruginosa transmissions due to environmental contamination after discharge in ICUs using mathematical models,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an important cause of healthcare-associated infections, particularly in immunocompromised patients. Understanding how this multi-drug resistant pathogen is transmitted within intensive care units (ICUs) is crucial for devising and evaluating successful control strategies. While it is known that moist environments serve as natural reservoirs for P. aeruginosa, there is little quantitative evidence regarding the contribution of environmental contamination to its transmission within ICUs. Previous studies on other nosocomial pathogens rely on deploying specific values for environmental parameters derived from costly and laborious genotyping. Using solely longitudinal surveillance data, we estimated the relative importance of P. aeruginosa transmission routes by exploiting the fact that different routes cause different pattern of fluctuations in the prevalence.\n\nWe developed a mathematical model including endogenous colonization, cross-transmission and environmental contamination. Patients contribute to a pool of pathogens by shedding bacteria to the environment. Natural decay and cleaning of the environment lead to a reduction of that pool. By assigning the bacterial load shed during an ICU stay to cross-transmission, we were able to disentangle environmental contamination during and after a patients stay. Based on a data-augmented Markov Chain Monte Carlo method the relative importance of the considered acquisition routes is determined for two ICUs of the University hospital in Besancon (France). We used information about the admission and discharge days, screening days and screening results of the ICU patients.\n\nBoth cross-transmission and endogenous transmission play a significant role in the transmission process in both ICUs. In contrast, only about 1% of the total transmissions were due to environmental contamination after discharge.\n\nImproved cleaning of the environment after discharge would have only a limited impact regarding the prevention of P.A. infections in the two considered ICUs. Our model was developed for P. aeruginosa but can be easily applied to other pathogens as well.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the transmission dynamics of multi-drug resistant pathogens in intensive-care units is essential for designing successful infection control strategies. We developed a method that estimates the relative importance of several transmission routes of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), a bacterium intrinsically resistant to multiple antibiotics and known to be a major contributor to hospital-acquired infections. Our model includes three different routes: endogenous colonization, cross-transmission and environmental contamination. Since moist environments may serve as natural reservoirs for P. aeruginosa, we focused our study on environmental contamination. Patients contribute to a pool of pathogens by shedding bacteria to the environment. Natural decay and cleaning of the environment lead to a reduction of that pool. By assigning the bacterial load shed during an ICU stay to cross-transmission, we disentangled environmental contamination during and after a patients stay. Previous studies were able to assess the role of environmental contamination for specific hospitals using laborious and costly genotyping methods. In contrast, we only used surveillance screening data to estimate the relative contributions of the considered transmission routes. Our results can be used to tailor or assess the effect of interventions. Our model was developed for P. aeruginosa but can be easily applied to other pathogens as well.","Pham, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,57683,"Genome sequence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161, a PAO1 derivative with the ICEPae1161 integrative and conjugative element","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of nosocomial infections, especially in patients with cystic fibrosis and burn wounds. An attenuated PAO1 strain and its derivatives are widely used to study the biology of this bacterium, however recent studies indicated an ongoing evolution of the laboratory strains, highlighted by changes in the genomes of PAO1 sublines and derivatives used in different laboratories worldwide.\n\nHere we have sequenced the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1161 strain, a leu-, RifR, restriction-modification defective PAO1 derivative. This strain is described as the host of IncP-8 plasmid FP2, conferring the resistance to mercury and used in the past for preparation of genetic map of the P. aeruginosa chromosome. Comparison of PAO1161 genome sequence with PAO1-UW reference genome revealed an inversion of the large genome segment between rrnA and rrnB rRNA operons and more than 100 nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions-deletions, many of which were also found within the recently re-sequenced PAO1 sublines. The PAO1161 specific sequence variants include E108K mutation in PA3792 (leuA), which we showed is responsible for leucine auxotrophy, H531L in PA4270 (rpoB), likely conferring rifampicin resistance, as well as nonsense mutations in PA2735 encoding a DNA methyltransferase as well as a putative OLD family endonuclease PA1939. Additionally, PAO1161 genome poses a 12 kb RPG42 prophage and a 108 kbp insertion within tRNA-Lys, encompassing a putative mercury resistance and showing similarity to PAPI-1 like integrative conjugative elements (ICE). Our data indicate that the ICE can excise from the bacterial chromosome and can be transferred to Pseudomonas putida cells where it integrates in the genome at three specific sites and confers the cells with mercury resistance. Overall this data provide insight into the genome variation between P. aeruginosa laboratory strains.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,57956,The bacillithiol pathway is required for biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen that can cause infections that range from superficial skin and mucosal infections to life threatening disseminated infections. S. aureus can attach to medical devices and host tissues and form biofilms that allow the bacteria to evade the host immune system and provide protection from antimicrobial agents. To counter host-generated oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms that are part of the normal host responses to invading pathogens, S. aureus utilizes low molecular weight (LMW) thiols, such as bacillithiol (BSH). Additionally, S. aureus synthesizes its own nitric oxide (NO), which combined with its downstream metabolites may also protect the bacteria against specific host responses. We have previously shown that LMW thiols are required for biofilm formation in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Our data show that the bshC mutant, which is defective in the last step of the bacillithiol pathway and lacks BSH, is impaired in biofilm formation. We also identify a putative S-nitrosobacillithiol reductase (BSNOR), similar to a S-nitrosomycothiol reductase found in M. smegmatis, and show that the BSNOR mutant has reduced levels of BSH and decreased biofilm formation. Our studies also show that NO plays an important role in biofilm formation and that acidified sodium nitrite severely reduces biofilm thickness. These studies provide insight into the roles of oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms on biofilm formation and indicate that bacillithiol and nitric oxide are key players in normal biofilm formation in S. aureus.\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus aureus is the most frequent cause of biofilm-associated infections in hospital settings. The biofilm mode of growth allows the pathogen to escape the host immune response and is extremely difficult to combat, as biofilms are highly resistant to physical and chemical stressors. As outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains become more commonplace, it is essential to understand the pathways involved in biofilm formation in order to target this important virulence factor. Low molecular weight thiols enable S. aureus to combat oxidative and nitrosative stress mechanisms that are used by host cells to defend against infection. Our findings indicate that bacillithiol and nitric oxide, which are produced by S. aureus to combat these host generated stressors, are important for biofilm development, and that disruption of these pathways results in biofilm defects. In the long term, this work may lead to new solutions to eradicate S. aureus biofilms in the clinic.","Gulati, M.; Thomas, J. M.; Rawat, M.; Nobile, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,58016,Native CRISPR-Cas mediated in situ genome editing reveals the exquisite interplay of resistance mutations in clinical multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is imposing a global public health threat. Despite its importance, resistance characterization in the native background of clinically isolated resistant pathogens is frequently hindered by the lack of genome editing tools in these \""non-model\"" strains. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is both a prototypical multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen and a model species for understanding CRISPR-Cas functions. In this study, we report the successful development of the first native type I-F CRISPR-Cas mediated, one-step genome editing technique in a paradigmatic MDR strain PA154197. The technique is readily applicable in additional type I-F CRISPR-containing, clinical/environmental P. aeruginosa isolates. A two-step In-Del strategy is further developed to edit genomic locus lacking an effective PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) or within an essential gene, which together principally allows any type of non-lethal genomic manipulations in these strains. Exploiting these powerful techniques, a series of reverse mutations are constructed and the key resistant determinants of the MDR PA154197 are elucidated which include over-production of two multidrug efflux pumps MexAB-OprM and MexEF-OprN, and a typical fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance mutation T83I in the drug target gene gyrA. Characterizing antimicrobial susceptibilities in isogenic strains containing various combinations of single, double, or all three key resistance determinants reveal that i) extensive synergy exists between the target mutation and over-production of efflux pumps, and between the two over-produced tripartite efflux pumps to confer clinically significant FQ resistance; ii) while basal level MexAB-OprM confers resistance only to penicillins, its over-production leads to substantial resistance to all antipseudonmonal {beta}-lactams and additional resistance to FQs; iii) despite the acquisition and over-production of multiple resistant mutations, no obvious evolutionary trade-off of collateral sensitivity is developed in PA154197. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance development in clinical MDR P. aeruginosa strains and demonstrate the great potentials of native CRISPR systems in AMR research.","Xu, Z.; Li, M.; Li, Y.; Cao, H.; Woo, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,58130,Accessory genome contributes to the virulence and resistance of the ocular isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: A complete genome analysis,"Bacteria can acquire an accessory genome through the horizontal transfer of genetic elements from non-parental lineages. This leads to rapid genetic evolution allowing traits such as antibiotic resistance and virulence to spread through bacterial communities. The study of complete genomes of bacterial strains helps to understand the genomic traits associated with virulence and antibiotic resistance. We aimed to investigate the complete accessory genome of an ocular isolate of P. aeruginosa. We obtained the complete genome of the ocular isolate strain PA34 of P. aeruginosa utilising genome sequence reads from Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technology followed by PCR to close any identified gaps. In-depth genomic analysis was performed using various bioinformatics tools. The phenotypic properties of susceptibility to heavy metals and cytotoxicity were determined to confirm expression of certain traits. The complete genome of PA34 includes a chromosome of 6.8 Mbp and two plasmids of 95.4 Kbp (pMKPA34-1) and 26.8 Kbp (pMKPA34-2). PA34 had a large accessory genome of 1,213 genes and had 543 unique genes not present in other strains. These exclusive genes encoded features related to metal and antibiotic resistance, phage integrase and transposons. At least 24 GIs were predicated in the complete chromosome, of which two were integrated into novel sites. Eleven GIs carried virulence factors or replaced pathogenic genes. A bacteriophage carried the aminoglycoside resistance gene (aac(3)-IId). The two plasmids carried other six antibiotic resistance genes.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,58437,Mechanistic insights of the attenuation of quorum-sensing-dependent virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Molecular modeling of the interaction of taxifolin with transcriptional regulator LasR,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most dangerous superbugs and is responsible for both acute and chronic infection. Current therapies are not effective because of biofilms that increase antibiotic resistance. Bacterial virulence and biofilm formation are regulated through a system called quorum sensing, which includes transcriptional regulators LasR and RhIR. These regulators are activated by their own natural autoinducers. Targeting this system is a promising strategy to combat bacterial pathogenicity. Flavonoids are very well known for their antimicrobial activity and taxifolin is one of them. It is also known that flavonoids inhibit Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation, but the mechanism of action is unknown. In the present study, we tried to analyse the mode of interactions of LasR with taxifolin. We used a combination of molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning techniques, which includes principal component and cluster analysis to study the interaction of the LasR protein with taxifolin. We show that taxifolin has two binding modes. One binding mode is the interaction with ligand binding domain. The second mode is the interaction with the \""bridge\"", which is a cryptic binding site. It involves conserved amino acid interactions from multiple domains. Biochemical studies show hydroxyl group of ring A in flavonoids is necessary for inhibition. In our model the hydroxyl group ensures the formation of many hydrogen bonds during the second binding mode. Microsecond simulations also show the stability of the formed complex. This study may offer insights on how taxifolin inhibits LasR and the quorum sensing circuitry.","Grabski, H.; Tiratsuyan, S.",2018-12-19,Bioinformatics,10.1101/500157,1,Hovakim  Grabski,Russian-Armenian University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/500157v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/500157v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,58384,Learning of pathogenic bacteria in adult C. elegans bidirectionally regulates pathogen response in the progeny,"Parental experience can generate adaptive changes in the behavioral and physiological traits of the offspring1-3. However, the biological properties of this intergenerational regulation and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism are not well understood. Here, we show that the experience of learning to avoid pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans alters the behavioral response to the pathogen in the progeny through the endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. We previously show that the adult C. elegans learns to avoid the smell of pathogenic bacteria, such as the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14, after feeding on the pathogen for a few hours4,5. Here, we report that this learning experience can bidirectionally regulate the olfactory response to PA14 in the progeny that are never directly exposed to the pathogen. The olfactory preference for PA14 in these progeny is linearly correlated with the learned avoidance of PA14 in their mothers. If the mothers show strong learning of PA14, their progeny avoid PA14; intriguingly, if the mothers show weak learning of PA14, the progeny prefer PA14, suggesting that the PA14-trained mothers transmit both the negative and positive information of PA14 to their progeny. The intergenerational behavioral effect results from an altered behavioral decision regulated by an olfactory sensorimotor neural circuit. Learning to avoid the pathogen also influences the development of the progeny, which is regulated independently from the behavioral change. Animals mutated for the RRF-3/RNA-directed RNA polymerase, a master regulator for the synthesis of the small interfering RNAs that are maternally inherited or in the soma6,7, display the normal naive and learned response to PA14 but are defective in regulating the olfactory response to PA14 in their progeny. Our results characterize an intergenerational effect that allows the progeny to rapidly adapt to an environmental condition that is critical for survival.","Pereira, A.; Gracida, X.; Kagias, K.; Zhang, Y.",2019-01-10,Neuroscience,10.1101/500264,2,Yun  Zhang,"Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Center for Brain Science, Harvard University",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/500264v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/500264v2.full.pdf,cc_no,NA

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,60767,"Black sea cucumber (Holothuria atra Jaeger, 1833) protects Caenorhabditis elegans against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection","A strategy to circumvent the problem of multidrug resistant pathogen is consumption of functional food rich in anti-infectives targeting bacterial virulence or host immunity. The black sea cucumber (Holothuria atra) is a tropical marine sea cucumer species traditionally consumed as remedy for many ailments. There is a paucity of knowledge the anti-infectives capacity of H. atra and the underlying mechanisms involved. The objectives of this study were to utilize the Caenorhabditis elegans-P. aeruginosa infection model to assess the anti-infective properties of H. atra. We first showed the capacity of a H. atra extract and fraction in promoting survival of C. elegans during a customarily lethal P. aeruginosa infection. The same chemical entities also attenuate the production of several P. aeruginosa virulence factors and biofilm. Treatment of infected transgenic lys-7::GFP worms with H. atra fraction restored the repressed expression of lys-7, a defense enzyme, indicating improved host immunity. QTOF-LCMS analysis revealed the presence of aspidospermatidine, an indole alkaloid and inosine. Collectively, our finding shows that H. atra confers survival advantage in C. elegans against P. aeruginosa infection through inhibition of pathogen virulence and eventually, the restitution of host lys-7 expression.","Lee, W.-T.; Tan, B.-K.; Eng, S.-A.; Yuen, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,60930,Ethanol stimulates trehalose production through a SpoT-DksA-AlgU dependent pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently resides among ethanol-producing microbes, making its response to these microbially-produced concentrations of ethanol relevant to understanding its biology. Our ranscriptome analysis found that the genes involved in trehalose metabolism were induced by low concentrations of ethanol, and levels of intracellular trehalose increased significantly upon growth with ethanol. The increase in trehalose was dependent on the TreYZ pathway, but not other trehalose metabolic enzymes TreS or TreA. The sigma factor AlgU (AlgT), a homolog of RpoE in other species, was required for increased expression of the treZ gene and trehalose levels, but induction was not controlled by the well-characterized proteolysis of its antisigma factor MucA. Growth with ethanol led to increased SpoT-dependent (p)ppGpp accumulation, which stimulates AlgU-dependent transcription of treZ and other AlgU-regulated genes through DksA, a (p)ppGpp and RNA polymerase binding protein. Ethanol stimulation of trehalose also required acylhomoserine lactone (AHL)-mediated quorum sensing, as induction was not observed in a {Delta}lasR{Delta}rhlR strain. A network analysis using a model, eADAGE, built from publicly available P. aeruginosa transcriptome datasets (1) provided strong support for our model that treZ and co-regulated genes are controlled by both AlgU and AHL-mediated QS (QS). Consistent with (p)ppGpp and AHL-mediated quorum sensing regulation, ethanol, even when added at the time of culture inoculation, stimulated treZ transcript levels and trehalose production in cells from post-exponential phase cultures but not from exponential phase cultures. These data highlight the integration of growth and cell density cues in the P. aeruginosa transcriptional response to ethanol.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is often found with bacteria and fungi that produce fermentation products including ethanol. At concentrations similar to those produced by environmental microbes, we found that ethanol stimulated expression of trehalose biosynthetic genes and cellular levels of trehalose, a disaccharide that protects against environmental stresses. The induction of trehalose by ethanol required the alternative sigma factor AlgU through DksA and SpoT-dependent (p)ppGpp. Trehalose accumulation also required AHL quorum sensing and only occurred in post-exponential phase cultures. This work highlights how cells integrate cell-density and growth cues in their responses to products made by other microbes and a reveals a new role for (p)ppGpp in the regulation of AlgU activity.","Harty, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,60923,Identification of flavone and its derivatives as potential inhibitors of transcriptional regulator LasR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using virtual screening,"Antibiotic resistance is a global problem nowadays and in 2017 the World Health Organization published the list of bacteria for which treatment are urgently needed, where Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of critical priority. Current therapies lack efficacy because this organism creates biofilms conferring increased resistance to antibiotics and host immune responses. The strategy is to ""not kill, but disarm"" the pathogen and resistance will be developed slowly. It has been shown that LasI/LasR system is the main component of the quorum sensing system in P. aeruginosa. LasR is activated by the interaction with its native autoinducer. A lot flavones and their derivatives are used as antibacterial drug compounds. The purpose is to search compounds that will inhibit LasR. This leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of virulence factors thus the bacteria will be vulnerable and not virulent. We performed virtual screening using multiple docking programs for obtaining consensus predictions. The results of virtual screening suggest benzamides which are synthetical derivatives of flavones as potential inhibitors of transcriptional regulator LasR. These are consistent with recently published experimental data, which demonstrate the high antibacterial activity of benzamides. The compounds interact with the ligand binding domain of LasR with higher binding affinity than with DNA binding domain. Among the selected compounds, by conformational analysis, it was found that there are compounds that bind to the same amino acids of ligand binding domain as the native autoinducer. This could indicate the possibility of competitive interaction of these compounds. A number of compounds that bind to other conservative amino acids ligand binding domain have also been discovered, which will be of interest for further study. Selected compounds meet the criteria necessary for their consideration as drugs and can serve as a basis for conducting further in vitro / in vivo experiments. It could be used for the development of modern anti-infective therapy based on the quorum sensing system of P. aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,61109,Clustering and rapid long-range motility behavior of bacteria by type IV pili,"Many organisms coordinate to move and colonize over surfaces. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibit such surface motility as a precursor step to forming biofilms. Here we show a group surface motility where small groups of P. aeruginosa use their type IV pili (TFP) appendages over long-distances. Small cell clusters employ their TFP to move multiple cell lengths in fractions of a second and form new multicellular groups. Given the length scale and speed of displacement, cells appear to \""snap\"" to a new position and then resume their previous behavior. The same long range TFP action also leads to rapid community contraction of sparsely arranged cell clusters. Cluster development and snapping motility does not require exogenous DNA or extracellular polysaccharides.","Madukoma, C. S.; Morales-Soto, N.; Mattingly, A. E.; Lee, S. W.; Shrout, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,61999,Heterogeneity in surface sensing produces a division of labor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations,"The second messenger signaling molecule cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) drives the transition from planktonic to biofilm growth in many bacterial species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has two surface sensing systems that produce c-di-GMP in response to surface adherence. The current thinking in the field is that once cells attach to a surface, they uniformly respond with elevated c-di-GMP. Here, we describe how the Wsp system generates heterogeneity in surface sensing, resulting in two physiologically distinct subpopulations of cells. One subpopulation has elevated c-di-GMP and produces biofilm matrix, serving as the founders of initial microcolonies. The other subpopulation has low c-di-GMP and engages in surface motility, allowing for exploration of the surface. We also show that this heterogeneity strongly correlates to surface behavior for descendent cells. Together, our results suggest that after surface attachment, P. aeruginosa engages in a division of labor that persists across generations, accelerating early biofilm formation and surface exploration.","Armbruster, C.

We have established a methodology for label-free imaging and tracking of individual cells simultaneously at both the solid-liquid interface and within the bulk, utilizing imaging modes of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) in 3D, differential interference contrast (DIC) and total internal reflectance microscopy (TIRM) in 2D as well as analysis protocols using a bespoke software package. We illustrate the power of this method by making detailed single cell measurements of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the first minutes of their interaction with a glass surface, focusing on the role of the flagella stators, motAB and motCD. Using this new method we have determined their relative contributions to bulk and near surface motion for populations of cells at the single cell level.","Hook, A. L.; Flewellen, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,64043,Phage efficacy in infecting dual-strain biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacterial viruses, or phage, play a key role in shaping natural microbial communities. Yet much research on bacterial-phage interactions has been conducted in liquid cultures involving single bacterial strains. Critically, phage often have a very narrow host range meaning they can only ever target a subset of strains in a community. Here we explore how strain diversity affects the success of lytic phage in structured communities. In particular, we infect a susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PAO1 with lytic phage Pseudomonas 352 in the presence versus absence of an insensitive P. aeruginosa strain PA14, in liquid culture versus colonies growing on agar. We find that competition between the two bacterial strains reduces the likelihood of the susceptible strain evolving resistance to the phage. This result holds in liquid culture and in colonies. However, while in liquid the phage eliminate the whole sensitive population, colonies contain refuges wherein bacteria can remain sensitive yet escape phage infection. These refuges form mainly due to reduced growth in colony centers. We find little evidence that the presence of the insensitive strain provides any additional protection against phage. Our study reveals that living in a spatially structured population can protect bacteria against phage infection, while the presence of competing strains may instead reduce the likelihood of evolving resistance to phage, if encountered.","Testa, S.; Berger, S.; Piccardi, P.; Oechslin, F.; Resch, G.; Mitri, S.",2019-02-15,Microbiology,10.1101/551754,1,Sara  Mitri,University of Lausanne,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551754v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551754v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1038/s42003-019-0633-x
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,63922,A T6SS trans-kingdom effector is required for the delivery of a novel antibacterial toxin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has evolved multiple strategies to disarm and take advantage of its host. For this purpose this opportunist pathogen has particularly developed protein secretion in the surrounding medium or injection into host cells. Among this, the Type VI Secretion System (T6SS) is utilized to deliver effectors into eukaryotic host as well as target bacteria. It assembles into a contractile bacteriophage tail-like structure that functions like a crossbow, injecting an arrow loaded with effectors into the target cell. The repertoire of T6SS antibacterial effectors of P. aeruginosa is remarkably broad to promote environmental adaptation and survival in various bacterial communities, and presumably in the eukaryotic host too.

Here we report the discovery a novel pair of antibacterial effector and immunity of P. aeruginosa, Tle3 and Tli3. Tli3 neutralizes the toxicity of Tle3 in the periplasm to protect from fratricide intoxication. The characterization of the secretion mechanism of Tle3 indicates that it requires a cytoplasmic adaptor, Tla3, to be targeted and loaded onto the VgrG2b spike and thus delivered by the H2-T6SS machinery. Tla3 is different from the other adaptors discovered so far, and defines a novel family among T6SS.

Interestingly this led us to discover that VgrG2b that we previously characterized as an anti-eukaryotic effector possesses an antibacterial activity as well, as it is toxic towards Escherichia coli. VgrG2b is thus a novel trans-kingdom effector targeting both bacteria and eukaryotes. VgrG2b represents an interesting target for fighting against P. aeruginosa in the environment and in the context of host infection.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,65215,Bacterial persisters in long-term infection: emergence and fitness in a complex host environment,"Despite intensive antibiotic treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, Pseudomonas aeruginosa often persists in patient airways for decades, and can do so without the development of antibiotic resistance. Using a high-throughput screening assay of survival after treatment with high concentrations of ciprofloxacin, we have determined the prevalence of high-persister variants (Hip) in a large patient cohort. In a screen of 467 longitudinal clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from 40 CF patients, we classified 25.7% as Hip. Hip were identified in 26 patients, but only a few bacterial lineages were dominated by Hip. Instead, the emergence of Hip increased over time, suggesting that CF airways treated with ciprofloxacin select for Hip with an increased fitness in this environment. We generally observed diverse genetic changes in the Hip isolate population (as many co-occurring routes to increased fitness exist), but interestingly elevated mutation counts in the RpoN gene of 18 Hip isolates suggest that this sigma factor plays a role in shaping levels of antibiotic tolerance. To probe the impact of the Hip phenotype in a CF-similar environment, we tested the fitness properties of otherwise genotypically and phenotypically similar low-persister (Lop) and Hip isolates in co-culture using a specialized flow-cell biofilm system mimicking pharmacokinetic/-dynamic antibiotic dosing. Hip survived ciprofloxacin treatment far better than Lop isolates. The results of this investigation provide novel insights into persister dynamics and fitness contributions to survival in the CF lung, and show that the Hip phenotype of antibiotic susceptible bacteria plays an important role in long-term infections.

SignificanceAntibiotic resistance is emphasized as a rapidly increasing health threat, but antibiotic tolerance via the occurrence of persister cells in antibiotic-treated bacterial populations is clinically and publicly neglected. In 40 CF patients representing a well-established human infection model - long-term lung infections by Pseudomonas aeruginosa - we show the emergence and accumulation of persister variants in a clinical population heavily reliant on antibiotic therapy. We observe that the high-persister (Hip) phenotype is independent of resistance and likely the consequence of numerous genetic alterations, complicating surveillance and inhibition in the clinic. Furthermore, we find Hip are selected for over time, survive better than  normal bacteria, and can outcompete them in CF-similar conditions, ultimately affecting 65% of patients in an early disease cohort.","Bartell, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,65766,Modulation of Flagellar Rotation in Surface-Attached Bacteria: A Circuit for Rapid Surface-Sensing,"Attachment is a necessary first step in bacterial commitment to surface-associated behaviors that include colonization, biofilm formation, and host-directed virulence. The Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa can initially attach to surfaces via its single polar flagellum. Although many bacteria quickly detach, some become irreversibly attached and express surface-associated structures, such as Type IV pili, and behaviors, including twitching motility and biofilm initiation. P. aeruginosa that lack the GTPase FlhF assemble a randomly placed flagellum that is motile; however, we observed that these mutant bacteria show defects in biofilm formation comparable to those seen for non-motile, aflagellate bacteria. This phenotype was associated with altered behavior of {Delta}flhF bacteria immediately following surface-attachment. Forward and reverse genetic screens led to the discovery that FlhF interacts with FimV to control flagellar rotation at a surface, and implicated cAMP signaling in this pathway. Although cAMP controls many transcriptional programs in P. aeruginosa, the known targets of this second messenger were not required to modulate flagellar rotation in surface-attached bacteria. Instead, alterations in switching behavior of the motor appear to result from previously undescribed effects of cAMP on switch complex proteins and/or the motor-stators associated with them.\n\nAuthor SummaryAttachment to a surface often triggers programs of gene expression that alter the behavior, virulence and fitness of bacteria. Initial contact is usually mediated by surface exposed adhesins, such as flagella or pili/fimbriae, and there is much interest in how these structures might sense and respond to surface attachment. The human bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa usually contacts surfaces via its polar flagellum, the rotary motor that also powers bacterial swimming. We observed that wild-type bacteria quickly stopped rotating their flagellum after surface attachment, but that a mutant lacking the flagellar-associated protein FlhF did not. Using a combination of genetic approaches, we demonstrated that FlhF interacts with a component of the flagellar rotor (FliG) and with a polar scaffolding protein that positively regulates cAMP production (FimV) to stop flagellar rotation and thereby favor bacterial persistence at a surface.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,65934,Thiostrepton hijacks pyoverdine receptors to inhibit growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a biofilm-forming opportunistic pathogen and intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics. In a high-throughput screen for molecules that modulate biofilm formation, we discovered that the thiopeptide antibiotic, thiostrepton (TS) - considered inactive against Gram-negative bacteria - stimulated P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in a dose-dependent manner. This phenotype is characteristic of exposure to antimicrobial compounds at sub-inhibitory concentrations, suggesting that TS was active against P. aeruginosa. Supporting this observation, TS inhibited growth of a panel of 96 multidrug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa clinical isolates at low micromolar concentrations. TS also had activity against Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. Expression of Tsr - a 23S rRNA-modifying methyltransferase - in trans conferred TS resistance, confirming that the drug acted via its canonical mode of action, inhibition of ribosome function. Deletion of oligopeptide permease systems used by other peptide antibiotics for uptake failed confer TS resistance. TS susceptibility was inversely proportional to iron availability, suggesting that TS exploits uptake pathways whose expression is increased under iron starvation. Consistent with this finding, TS activity against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was potentiated by FDA-approved iron chelators deferiprone and deferasirox. Screening of P. aeruginosa mutants for TS resistance revealed that it exploits pyoverdine receptors FpvA and FpvB to cross the outer membrane. Our data show that the biofilm stimulation phenotype can reveal cryptic sub-inhibitory antibiotic activity, and that TS has activity against select multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens under iron-limited growth conditions, similar to those encountered at sites of infection.","Ranieri, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,66391,Evolutionary stability of collateral sensitivity to antibiotics in the model pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Evolution is at the core of the impending antibiotic crisis. Sustainable therapy must thus account for the adaptive potential of pathogens. One option is to exploit evolutionary trade-offs, like collateral sensitivity, where evolved resistance to one antibiotic causes hypersensitivity to another one. To date, the evolutionary stability and thus clinical utility of this trade-off is unclear. We performed a critical experimental test on this key requirement, using evolution experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa combined with genomic and genetic analyses, and identified three main outcomes: (i) bacteria commonly failed to counter hypersensitivity and went extinct; (ii) hypersensitivity sometimes converted into multidrug resistance; and (iii) resistance gains occasionally caused re-sensitization to the previous drug, thereby maintaining the trade-off. Drug order affected the evolutionary outcome, most likely due to variation in fitness costs and epistasis among adaptive mutations. Our finding of robust genetic trade-offs and drug-order effects can guide design of evolution-informed antibiotic therapy.","Barbosa, C.; Roemhild, R.; Rosenstiel, P.; Schulenburg, H.",2019-03-09,Evolutionary Biology,10.1101/570663,1,Hinrich  Schulenburg,University of Kiel,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/570663v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/570663v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.7554/eLife.51481

We evaluated the resistance mechanisms of P. aeruginosa against POL7080, a species-specific, first-in-class antibiotic in phase 3 clinical trials targeting the lipopolysaccharide transport protein LptD. We found resistance mutations in the two-component regulator pmrB. Genome-wide transcriptomics and confocal microscopy studies together suggest that POL7080 is vulnerable to the same resistance mechanisms described previously for polymyxins, including colistin, that involve lipid A modifications to mitigate antibiotic cell surface binding.","Romano, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,66891,Ibuprofen-mediated potential inhibition of biofilm development and quorum sensing in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the leading causes of opportunistic and hospital-acquired infections worldwide. The infection with P. aeruginosa is frequently linked with clinical treatment difficulties given drug resistance and abuse of antibiotics. Ibuprofen, a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has been previously reported to exert antimicrobial activity, although the specific mechanism of its action requires additional investigation. Given the regulation effects on quorum sensing (QS), we hypothesized that inhibition of P. aeruginosa with ibuprofen is linked with the QS systems. First, we assessed the action of ibuprofen in P. aeruginosa by measuring CFU. The antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen was evaluated by crystal violent staining and acridine orange staining at various drug concentrations (0, 50, 75, and 100 g/mL). Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on different QS virulence factors, such as pyocyanin, elastase, protease, and rhamnolipids, was assessed revealing a concentration-dependent decrease (P<0.05). The effect of ibuprofen was confirmed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL production. In addition, qRT-PCR results identified significant suppression of Las and Rhl gene expression after 18 hours of treatment with ibuprofen (P<0.05), with the most significant suppression observed at the concentration of 75 g/mL. Functional complementation with exogenous 3-oxo-C12-HSL and C4-HSL suggested that C4-HSL can recover the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Molecular docking of ibuprofen with QS-associated proteins revealed high binding affinity. In summary, the results suggest that ibuprofen is a candidate drug for the treatment of clinical infections with P. aeruginosa.","Dai, L.; Wu, T.-Q.; Wang, Z.-H.; Yuan, R.; Ding, Y.; Zhang, W.-C.; Chu, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,67076,Host metabolic reprogramming of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by phage-based quorum sensing modulation,"The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) is a multifunctional quorum sensing molecule of key importance to the P. aeruginosa metabolism. We here describe that the lytic Pseudomonas bacterial virus LUZ19 targets this population-density-dependent signaling system by expressing quorum sensing-associated acyltransferase (Qst) during early infection. Qst interacts with a key biosynthesis pathway enzyme PqsD, resulting in decreased metabolites levels of PQS and its precursor 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone. The lack of a functional PqsD enzyme impairs the normal LUZ19 infection but is restored by external supplementation of 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone, showing that LUZ19 exploits PQS to successfully achieve its infection. A functional interaction network, which includes enzymes of the central carbon metabolism (CoaC/ThiD) and a novel non-ribosomal peptide synthetase pathway (PA1217), suggests a broader functional context for Qst, which blocks P. aeruginosa cell division. Qst represents an exquisite example of intricate reprogramming of the bacterium, which may be exploited towards antibiotic target discovery for this bacterial pathogen.","Hendrix, H.; Kogadeeva, M.; Zimmermann, M.; Sauer, U.; De Smet, J.; Muchez, L.; Lissens, M.; Staes, I.; Voet, M.; Wagemans, J.; Ceyssens, P.-J.; Noben, J.-P.; Aertsen, A.; Lavigne, R.",2019-03-16,Microbiology,10.1101/577908,1,Hanne  Hendrix,KU Leuven,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/577908v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/577908v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110372
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,67950,Bacterial biodiversity drives the evolution of CRISPR-based phage resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Approximately half of all bacterial species encode CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems1, which provide immunological memory by inserting short DNA sequences from phage and other parasitic DNA elements into CRISPR loci on the host genome2. Whereas CRISPR loci evolve rapidly in natural environments3, bacterial species typically evolve phage resistance by the mutation or loss of phage receptors under laboratory conditions4,5. Here, we report how this discrepancy may in part be explained by differences in the biotic complexity of in vitro and natural environments6,7. Specifically, using the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its phage DMS3vir, we show that coexistence with other human pathogens amplifies the fitness trade-offs associated with phage receptor mutation, and therefore tips the balance in favour of CRISPR-based resistance evolution. We also demonstrate that this has important knock-on effects for P. aeruginosa virulence, which became attenuated only if the bacteria evolved surface-based resistance. Our data reveal that the biotic complexity of microbial communities in natural environments is an important driver of the evolution of CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity, with key implications for bacterial fitness and virulence.","Alseth, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,67985,Vesicle-associated Pseudomonas aeruginosa leucine aminopeptidase modulates bacterial biofilms grown on host cellular substrates,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, secretes a variety of virulence-associated proteases. These enzymes have been shown to contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and biofilm formation in the chronic colonization of CF patient lungs, as well as playing a role in infections of the cornea, burn wounds and chronic wounds. Our lab has previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is not only secreted solubly, it also associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known for their contribution to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. With this in mind, we hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background leads to increased early biofilm formation. We additionally found that only native vesicle-bound PaAP, as opposed to its soluble forms, could reconstitute the original PaAP-mediated inhibition phenotype, and that the PaAP-containing vesicles could disperse preformed biofilm microcolonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae, another lung pathogen. These data provide the basis for future work into the mechanism behind PaAP-OMV mediated bacterial microcolony dispersal and the application of these findings to clinical anti-biofilm research.","Esoda, C.; Kuehn, M.",2019-03-24,Microbiology,10.1101/587279,1,Meta  Kuehn,Duke University Medical Center,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587279v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587279v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,68182,Two forms of phosphomannomutase in gammaproteobacteria: The overlooked membrane-bound form of AlgC is required for twitching motility of Lysobacter enzymogenes,"Lysobacter enzymogenes, a member of Xanthomonadaceae, is a promising tool to control crop-destroying fungal pathogens. One of its key antifungal virulence factors is the type IV pili that are required for twitching motility. Transposon mutagenesis of L. enzymogenes revealed that production of type IV pili required the presence of the Le2152 gene, which encodes an AlgC-type phosphomannomutase/phosphoglucomutase (PMM). However, in addition to the cytoplasmic PMM domain, the Le2152 gene product contains a ca. 200-aa N-terminal periplasmic domain that is anchored in the membrane by two transmembrane segments and belongs to the dCache superfamily of periplasmic sensor domains. Sequence analysis identified similar membrane-anchored PMMs, encoded in conserved coaBC-dut-algC gene clusters, in a variety of gammaproteobacteria, either as the sole PMM gene in the entire genome or in addition to the gene encoding the stand-alone enzymatic domain. Previously overlooked N-terminal periplasmic sensor domains were detected in the well-characterized PMMs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas campestris, albeit not in the enzymes from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida or Azotobacter vinelandii. It appears that after the initial cloning of the enzymatically active soluble part of P. aeruginosa AlgC in 1991, all subsequent studies utilized N-terminally truncated open reading frames. The N-terminal dCache sensor domain of AlgC is predicted to modulate the PMM activity of the cytoplasmic domain in response to as yet unidentified environmental signal(s). AlgC-like membrane-bound PMMs appear to comprise yet another environmental signaling system that regulates production of type IV pili and potentially other systems in certain gammaproteobacteria.","Qian, G.; Fei, S.; Galperin, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,68738,Transposable temperate phages promote the evolution of divergent social strategies in Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations,"Transposable temperate phages randomly insert into bacterial genomes, providing increased supply and altered spectra of mutations available to selection, thus opening alternative evolutionary trajectories. Transposable phages accelerate bacterial adaptation to new environments, but their effect on adaptation to the social environment is unclear. Here we show, using experimental evolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in iron-limited and iron-rich environments causing differential expression of siderophore cooperation, that transposable phages promoted divergence into extreme siderophore production phenotypes in iron-limited populations. Iron-limited populations with transposable phages evolved siderophore over-producing clones alongside siderophore non-producing cheats. Low siderophore production was associated with parallel mutations in pvd genes, encoding pyoverdine biosynthesis, and pqs genes, encoding quinolone signaling, while high siderophore production was associated with parallel mutations in phenazine-associated gene clusters. Notably, some of these parallel mutations were caused by phage insertional inactivation. These data suggest that transposable phages, which are widespread in microbial communities, can mediate the evolutionary divergence of social strategies.","O'brien, S.; Kummerli, R.; Paterson, S.; Winstanley, C.; Brockhurst, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,69418,Specific Disruption of Established P. aeruginosa Biofilms Using Polymer-Attacking Enzymes,"Biofilms are communities of bacteria embedded in an extracellular matrix of self-produced polymeric substances. This polymer matrix lends the bacteria protection against a wide array of chemical and mechanical stresses that they may experience in their environment, which might be a location in the human body in the case of a biofilm infection, or a surface immersed in fluid in an industrial setting. Breaking down the matrix network renders biofilms more susceptible to physical disruption and to treatments. Different species of bacteria, and different strains within the same species, produce different types of matrix polymers - this suggests that targeting specific polymers for disruption may be more effective than non-specific approaches to disrupting biofilm matrices. In this study, we treated Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms with enzymes that are specific to different matrix polymers. We used bulk rheology to measure the resulting alteration in biofilm mechanics, and scanning electron microscopy to visualize the alteration in the matrix network upon treatment. Different lab strains of P. aeruginosa form biofilms that can be dominated by one of three main extracellular polysaccharides: Psl, alginate, and Pel, which binds electrostatically to extracellular DNA in the matrix. We applied enzymes to biofilms dominated by different extracellular polysaccharides and found that, for biofilms grown in vitro, the effect of enzymatic treatment is maximized when the enzyme is specific to a dominant matrix polymer - for such a case, specifically-matched enzymatic treatment tends to: reduce yield strain and yield stress; reduce or eliminate long-range structure and shorten or eliminate connecting network fibers in the biofilm as seen under scanning electron microscopy; and increase the rate of biofilm drying, most likely due to increased diffusivity as a result of network compromise. However, for ex vivo biofilms grown in murine wounds, we find that generic glycoside hydrolases have more profound disruptive effects than specifically-matched enzymes, even though they had no measurable effect for biofilms grown in vitro. This highlights the importance of the environment in which the biofilms are grown, the need to take this into account when developing treatments for biofilms, and the possibility that effective approaches to eradicating biofilms in environmental or industrial settings may need to be very different from effective treatments of infection.","Kovach, K.; Fleming, D.; Rumbaugh, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,69500,Seed treatment with chitosan synergizes plant growth promoting ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-P17 in sorghum (Sorhum bicolor L.),"Inoculation of crop plants with PGPR has in a large number of investigations resulted in increased plant growth and yield both in the greenhouse and in the field. This plant growth promoting effect of bacteria could be due to net result of synergistic effect of various pgpr traits that they exert in the rhizosphere region of the plant. Four (04) bacterial strain of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. viz. P1, P17, P22 and P28 were identified previously for their plant growth promoting nature and abiotic stress tolerance and selected further to assess their chitinolytic activity and growth promotion on sorghum in combination with chitosans of low and high degree of acetylation. It was found that P1 has no chitin degrading nature and rest of the three strains have this property. When studied for their ability to grow in presence of chitosans of DA 1.6, 11, 35 and 56% all the strains showed growth in presence of chitosans. Seed bacterization of sorghum seeds with 04 bacterial strains in the presence and absence of chitosans (both low and high DA) and assessment of plant growth promotion after 15 days of sowing showed that P17+DA 56% chitosan combination showed higher growth of seedlings in plant growth chamber with highest root length of 25.9 cm, highest shoot length of 32.1 cm and dry mass of 132.7 mg/ plant. In P17+DA 56% chitosan treated seedlings various defence enzymes and PR-proteins were found to be present in highest quantities as compared to P1 and un-inoculated controls. Since this strain showed highest growth promotion of sorghum seedlings chitin-chitosan modifying enzyme (CCME) of this strain was partially characterized using different proteomic tools and techniques. CCME of P17 had one active polypeptide with a Pi in the range of 3.0-4.0. The digestion pattern of acetylated and deacetylated chitosans showed that P17 enzyme has endochitinase activity. Substrate specificity assay showed that the enzyme had more specificity towards highly acetylated chitosans. Two dimensional PAGE and MS analysis of the protein revealed similarities of this enzyme with protein of Pseudomonas aeruginosa chitinase PA01 strain of GenBank.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,69567,Synergistic interactions of quercetin with antibiotics against biofilm associated clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in vitro,"Development of extreme resistance to multiple antibiotics is the major concern in infections due to biofilm forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The existing antibiotics have become ineffective against biofilm associated infections and hence, in this study, the combinatorial efficacy of antibiotics with a quorum sensing inhibitor (quercetin) was tested against biofilm forming P. aeruginosa isolates. The effect of drug combinations was studied by the checkerboard method. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated for determining the synergistic effect. Additionally, biofilm cell viability, time-kill and live-dead assays were performed to study the combinatorial effect. MIC of quercetin against all the P. aeruginosa strains was 500 g/mL. However, quercetin at 125 g/mL showed synergistic effect with [1/2] x MIC or [1/4] x MIC of all the antibiotics against all the strains. Quercetin (125 g/mL) with [1/2] MIC of levofloxacin and tobramycin combinations were highly effective with [&ge;]80% killing of biofilm associated cells. Increasing the concentration to 250 g/mL with [1/2] x MIC antibiotics could completely inhibit the biofilm cell viability in quercetin combination with amikacin and tobramycin. The findings show that quercetin combinations can enhance the treatment outcome against P. aeruginosa infection and this approach may reduce antibiotic overuse and selection pressure.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/601336_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca26dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bbcc0forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5216b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@150c53d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG","Vipin, C.; Mujeeburahiman, M.; Saptami, K.; Arun, A.; Rekha, P.",2019-04-07,Microbiology,10.1101/601336,1,Pd  Rekha,Yenepoya University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601336v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601336v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,69953,Chemical biofilm dislodgement with chelating and reducing agents in comparison to sonication: implications for the diagnosis of implant associated infection,"Sonication of removed devices improved the microbiological diagnosis of infection. Recently, chemical agents have been investigated for dislodgement of biofilms, including the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). We compared the efficacy of chemical methods (EDTA and DTT) to sonication for biofilm dislodgement. Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 35984) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 53278) biofilms were grown on porous glass beads for 3 days. After biofilm formation, beads were exposed to 0.9% saline, sonication and/or chemical agents. Quantitative and qualitative biofilm analyses were performed by colony counting (CFU/ml), isothermal microcalorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. The colony counts after treatment with EDTA and DTT were similar to those after exposure to 0.9% saline (6.3, 6.1 and 6.0 log CFU/ml, respectively) for S. epidermidis biofilms, and (5.1, 5.2 and 5.0 log CFU/ml, respectively) for P. aeruginosa biofilm. Sonication detected higher CFU counts (7.5 log CFU/ml) for S. epidermidis; (p<0.05) and 6.5 log for P. aeruginosa biofilm (p <0.05). Concordant results were detected with isothermal microcalorimetry and scanning electron microscopy. In conclusion, the CFU count after treatment of S. epidermidis or P. aeruginosa biofilms with EDTA and DTT was similar to those observed after 0.9% saline used as control. In contrast, sonication was superior to chemical methods for biofilm dislodgment and detection of microorganisms in sonication fluid. In conclusion, our study showed that sonication is superior to chemical method to dislodge bacterial biofilm from artificial surface and should be considered as standard diagnostic method for biofilm detection in implant-associated infections.","Karbysheva, S.; Butini, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70121,Interspecies signaling generates exploratory motility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Microbes often live in multispecies communities where interactions among community members impact both the individual constituents and the surrounding environment. Here, we developed a system to visualize interspecies behaviors at initial encounters. By imaging two prevalent pathogens known to be coisolated from chronic illnesses, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, we observed P. aeruginosa can modify surface motility in response to secreted factors from S. aureus. Upon sensing S. aureus, P. aeruginosa transitioned from collective to single-cell motility with an associated increase in speed and directedness - a behavior we refer to as  exploratory motility. Through modulation of cAMP, explorer cells moved preferentially towards S. aureus and invaded S. aureus colonies through the action of the type IV pili. These studies reveal previously undescribed motility behaviors and lend insight into how P. aeruginosa senses and responds to other species. Identifying strategies to harness these interactions may open avenues for new antimicrobial strategies.","Limoli, D. H.; Donegan, N. P.; Warren, E. A.; Cheung, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70382,Taxonomic variability over functional stability in the microbiome of Cystic Fibrosis patients chronically infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Although the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome has been characterized in several studies, little is still known about the functions harboured by those bacteria, and how they change with disease status and antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the taxonomic and functional temporal dynamics of airways microbiome in a cohort of CF patients. Multiple sputum samples were collected over 15 months from 22 patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection, for a total of 79 samples. DNA extracted from samples was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing either strain-level taxonomic profiling and assessment of the functional metagenomic repertoire. High inter-patient taxonomic heterogeneity was found with short-term compositional changes during exacerbations and following antibiotic treatment. Each patient exhibited distinct sputum microbial communities at the taxonomic level, and strain-specific colonization of traditional CF pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, and emerging pathogens. Sputum microbiome was found to be extraordinarily resilient following antibiotic treatment, with rapid recovery of taxa and metagenome-associated gene functions. In particular, a large core set of genes, including antibiotic resistance genes, were shared across patients despite observed differences in clinical status or antibiotic treatment, and constantly detected in the lung microbiome of all subjects independently from known antibiotic exposure, suggesting an overall microbiome-associated functions stability despite taxonomic fluctuations of the communities.

IMPORTANCEWhile the dynamics of CF sputum microbial composition were highly patient-specific, the overall sputum metagenome composition was stable, showing a high resilience along time and antibiotic exposure. The high degree of redundancy in the CF lung microbiome could testifies ecological aspects connected to the disease that were never considered so far, as the large core-set of genes shared between patients despite observed differences in clinical status or antibiotic treatment. Investigations on the actual functionality (e.g. by metatranscriptomics) of the identified core-set of genes could provide clues on genetic function of the microbiome to be targeted in future therapeutic treatments.","Bacci, G.; Taccetti, G.; Dolce, D.; Armanini, F.; Segata, N.; Di Cesare, F.; Lucidi, V.; Fiscarelli, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70461,Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons modulate pathogen specific responses via HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor and FSHR-1 GPCR axes of immunity,"Pattern recognition receptors allow animals to sense microbe associated molecular patterns and mount effective immune responses. It is not clear how Caenorhabditis elegans recognizes pathogenic microbes in absence of classical pattern recognition pathways. Here, we asked if sensory neurons of C. elegans allow it to distinguish between pathogens. Exposure of C. elegans to a Gram positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis or to a Gram negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed predominantly pathogen-specific signatures. Using nematodes defective in sensory perception, we show that neuronal sensing is essential to mount pathogen specific immune response. OSM-6 expressing, ciliated neurons exert non-cell autonomous control of immune effector production via an OSM-6-FSHR-1 GPCR axis as well as an OSM-6-HLH-30/TFEB transcription factor axis during E. faecalis infection. OSM-6-FSHR-1 axis also controls immune response to P. aeruginosa. In all, this study delineates essential role of sensory perception in the regulation of pathogen-specific immunity in C. elegans.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/609610_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@33aa54org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f38464org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78c656org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1256266_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","Gupta, A.; Varma, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,71235,Genome annotation of Poly(lactic acid) degrading Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Sphingobacterium sp.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Sphinogobacterium sp. are well known for their ability to decontaminate many environmental pollutants like PAHs, dyes, pesticides and plastics. The present study reports the annotation of genomes from P. aeruginosa and Sphinogobacterium sp. that were isolated from compost, based on their ability to degrade poly(lactic acid), PLA, at mesophillic temperatures (~30{degrees}C). Draft genomes of both the strains were assembled from Illumina reads, annotated and viewed with an aim of gaining insight into the genetic elements involved in degradation of PLA. The draft-assembled genome of strain Sphinogobacterium strain S2 was 5,604,691 bp in length with 435 contigs (maximum length of 434,971 bp) and an average G+C content of 43.5%. The assembled genome of P. aeruginosa strain S3 was 6,631,638 bp long with 303 contigs (maximum contig length of 659,181 bp) and an average G+C content 66.17 %. A total of 5,385 (60% with annotation) and 6,437 (80% with annotation) protein-coding genes were predicted for strains S2 and S3 respectively. Catabolic genes for biodegradation of xenobiotic and aromatic compounds were identified on both draft genomes. Both strains were found to have the genes attributable to the establishment and regulation of biofilm, with more extensive annotation for this in S3. The genome of P. aeruginosa S3 had the complete cascade of genes involved in the transport and utilization of lactate while Sphinogobacterium strain S2 lacked lactate permease, consistent with its inability to grow on lactate. As a whole, our results reveal and predict the genetic elements providing both strains with the ability to degrade PLA at mesophilic temperature.","Satti, S. M.; Shah, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70664,Gene regulatory network inference and analysis of multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"BackgroundHealthcare-associated infections caused by bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are a major public health problem worldwide. Gene regulatory networks computationally represent interactions among regulatory genes and their targets, an important approach to understand bacterial behavior and to provide novel ways of overcoming scientific challenges, including the identification of potential therapeutic targets and the development of new drugs.\n\nObjectivesOur goal in this manuscript is to present a reconstruction of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa gene regulatory network and to analyze its topological properties.\n\nMethodsThe methodology was based on gene orthology inference by the reciprocal best hit method. We used the genome of P. aeruginosa CCBH4851 as the basis of the reconstruction process. This multidrug-resistant strain is representative of an endemic outbreak in Brazilian territory belonging to ST277.\n\nFindingsAs the main finding, we obtained a network with a larger number of regulatory genes, target genes and interactions compared to previous work. Topological analysis results are accordant to the complex network representation of biological processes.\n\nMain conclusionsThe network properties are consistent with P. aeruginosa biological features.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70668,Muropeptides Stimulate Growth Resumption from Stationary Phase in Escherichia coli,"When nutrients run out, bacteria enter a dormant metabolic state. This low or undetectable metabolic activity helps bacteria to preserve their scant reserves for future, but also diminishes their ability to trace the environment for new growth-promoting substrates. However, neighboring microbial growth is a sure indicator of favorable environment and thus, can serve as a cue for exiting the dormancy. Here we report that for Escherichia coli this cue is the basic peptidoglycan unit (i.e. muropeptide). We show that several forms of muropeptides can stimulate growth resumption of dormant E. coli cells, but the sugar - peptide bond is crucial for activity. We also demonstrate that muropeptides from several different species can induce growth resumption of E. coli and also Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These results, together with the previous identification of muropeptides as germination signal for bacterial spores, makes muropeptides rather universal cue for bacterial growth.","Joers, A.; Vind, K.; Hernandez, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70673,Defining Escherichia coli as a health-promoting microbe against intestinal Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Gut microbiota acts as a barrier against intestinal pathogens, but species-specific protection of the host from infection remains relatively unexplored. Taking a Kochs postulates approach in reverse to define health-promoting microbes we find that Escherichia coli naturally colonizes the gut of healthy mice, but it is depleted from the gut of antibiotic-treated mice, which become susceptible to intestinal colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and concomitant mortality. Reintroduction of fecal bacteria and E. coli establishes a high titer of E. coli in the host intestine and increases defence against P. aeruginosa colonization and mortality. Moreover, diet is relevant in this process because high sugars or dietary fat favours E. coli fermentation to lactic acid and P. aeruginosa growth inhibition. To the contrary, low sugars allow P. aeruginosa to produce the oxidative agent pyocyanin that inhibits E. coli growth. Our results provide an explanation as to why P. aeruginosa doesnt commonly infect the human gut, despite being a formidable microbe in lung and wound infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryHere we interrogate the conundrum as to why Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not a clinical problem in the intestine as opposed to other tissues. P. aeruginosa interacts with Neisseria, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Actinomyces species found in the human lung. These are predominantly gram-positive bacteria that induce P. aeruginosa virulence. Moreover, peptidoglycan, which is abundant in gram-positive bacteria, can directly trigger the virulence of P. aeriginosa. We reasoned that P. aeruginosa might be benign in the human gut due to the inhibitory action of benign gram-negative intestinal bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. Therefore, we dissected the antagonism between E. coli and P. aeruginosa and the effect of a conventional, a fat-, a carbohydrate-and a protein-based diet in intestinal dysbiosis. Our findings support the notion that an unbalanced diet or antibiotics induces gut dysbiosis by the elimination of commensal E. coli, in addition to lactic acid bacteria, imposing a gut environment conducive to P. aeruginosa infection. Moreover, commensal E. coli provides an explanation as to why P. aeruginosa doesnt commonly infect the human gut, despite being a formidable microbe in lung and wound infections.","Christofi, T.; Panayidou, S.; Dieronitou, I.; Michael, C.; Apidianakis, Y.",2019-04-17,Microbiology,10.1101/612606,1,Yiorgos  Apidianakis,UCY,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/612606v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/612606v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1038/s41598-019-51058-3
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,70864,Induction of Rare Conformation of Oligosaccharide by Binding to Calcium-dependent Bacterial Lectin: X-ray Crystallography and Modelling Study,"Pathogenic micro-organisms utilize protein receptors in adhesion to host tissues, a process that in some cases relies on the interaction between lectin and human glycoconjugates. Oligosaccharide epitopes are recognized through their three-dimensional structure and their flexibility is a key issue in specificity. In this paper, we analyse by X-ray crystallography the structures of the lectin LecB from two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in complex with Lewis x oligosaccharide present on cell surfaces of human tissues. An unusual conformation of the glycan was observed in all binding sites with a non-canonical syn orientation of the N-acetyl group of N-acetyl-glucosamine. A PDB-wide search revealed that such an orientation occurs only in 2% of protein/carbohydrate complexes. Theoretical chemistry calculations showed that the observed conformation is unstable in solution but stabilised by the lectin. A reliable description of LecB/Lewis x complex by force field-based methods had proven as especially challenging due to the special feature of the binding site, two closely apposed Ca2+ ions which induce strong charge delocalisation. By comparing various force-field parametrisations, we design general protocols which will be useful in near future for designing carbohydrate-based ligands (glycodrugs) against other calcium-dependent protein receptors.","Lepsik, M.; Sommer, R.; Kuhaudomlarp, S.; Lelimousin, M.; Paci, E.; Varrot, A.; Titz, A.; Imberty, A.",2019-04-18,Biophysics,10.1101/612689,1,Martin  Lepsik,"Univ.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is implicated in a wide range of human infections that almost complicated and become life threating especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Conventional microbiological methods take more than 3 days to obtain accurate results. Pyocyanin is a distinctive electroactive biomarker for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we have developed a rapid diagnostic (polyaniline) PANI gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) modified indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode that showed 100% sensitivity for pyocyanin in culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates and high selectivity for pyocyanin at low concentration when measured in the presence of other substances like ascorbic acid, uric acid, and glucose as interferences. The constructed electrode was characterized using scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The determined linear range for pyocyanin detection was from 238 {micro}M to 1.9 {micro}M with a detection limit of 500 nM. Compared to the screen-printed electrode used before, the constructed electrode showed a 4-fold enhanced performance.","Elkhawaga, A. A.; Khalifa, M. M.; El-Badawy, O. H. B.; Hassan, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,71446,Modulating pathogenesis with Mobile-CRISPRi,"Pathogens express a set of proteins required for establishing and maintaining an infection, termed virulence life-style genes (VLGs). Due to their outsized importance in pathogenesis, VLG products are attractive targets for the next generation of antimicrobials. However, precise manipulation of VLG expression in the context of infection is technically challenging, limiting our ability to understand the roles of VLGs in pathogenesis and accordingly design effective inhibitors. We previously developed a suite of gene knockdown tools that are transferred by conjugation and stably integrate into pathogen genomes that we call \""Mobile-CRISPRi\"". Here we show the efficacy of Mobile-CRISPRi in controlling VLG expression in a murine infection model. We optimize Mobile-CRISPRi in Pseudomonas aeruginosa for use in a murine model of pneumonia by tuning the expression of CRISPRi components to avoid non-specific toxicity. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that knockdown of a VLG encoding the type III secretion system (T3SS) activator ExsA blocks effector protein secretion in culture and attenuates virulence in mice. We anticipate that Mobile-CRISPRi will be a valuable tool to probe the function of VLGs across many bacterial species and pathogenesis models.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance is a growing threat to global health. To optimize the use of our existing antibiotics and identify new targets for future inhibitors, understanding the fundamental drivers of bacterial growth in the context of the host immune response is paramount. Historically these genetic drivers have been difficult to manipulate, as they are requisite for pathogen survival. Here, we provide the first application of Mobile-CRISPRi to study virulence life-style genes in mouse models of lung infection through partial gene perturbation. We envision the use of Mobile-CRISPRi in future pathogenesis models and antibiotic target discovery efforts.","Rosenberg, O.; Qu, J.-X.; Prasad, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,71731,Crystal structures of the outer membrane transporter FoxA provide novel insights into TonB-mediated siderophore uptake and signalling,"Many microbes and fungi acquire the essential ion Fe3+ through the synthesis and secretion of high-affinity chelators termed siderophores. In Gram-negative bacteria, these ferric-siderophore complexes are actively taken up using highly specific TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) located in the outer bacterial membrane (OM). However, the detailed mechanism of how the inner-membrane protein TonB connects to the transporters in the OM as well as the interplay between siderophore- and TonB-binding to the transporter is still poorly understood. Here, we present three crystal structures of the TBDT FoxA from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (containing a signalling domain) in complex with the siderophore ferrioxamine B and TonB and combine them with a detailed analysis of binding constants. The structures show that both siderophore and TonB-binding is required to form a translocation-competent state of the FoxA transporter in a two-step TonB-binding mechanism. The complex structure also indicates how TonB-binding influences the orientation of the signalling domain.","Josts, I.; Veith, K.; Tidow, H.",2019-04-28,Molecular Biology,10.1101/621219,1,Henning  Tidow,University of Hamburg,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/621219v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/621219v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.7554/elife.48528

This study investigates the genomic and genetic basis of bacterial-driven variability in P. aeruginosa virulence towards C. elegans. Natural isolates of P. aeruginosa that exhibit diverse genomes display a broad range of virulence towards C. elegans. Using gene association and genetic analysis, we identified accessory genome elements that correlate with virulence, including both known and novel virulence determinants. Among the novel genes, we found a viral-like mobile element, the teg block, that impairs virulence and whose acquisition is restricted by CRISPR-Cas systems. Further genetic and genomic evidence suggests that spacer-targeted elements preferentially associate with lower virulence and suggest a positive, albeit indirect, role for host CRISPR-Cas systems in the restriction of accessory genome elements that may be detrimental to virulence.","Vasquez-Rifo, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,72007,Interspecies interactions in bacterial colonies are determined by physiological traits and the environment,"Interspecies interactions in bacterial biofilms have important impacts on the composition and function of communities in natural and engineered systems. To investigate these interactions, synthetic communities provide experimentally tractable systems. Agar-surface colonies are similar to biofilms and have been used for investigating the eco-evolutionary and biophysical forces that determine community composition and spatial distribution of bacteria. Prior work has focused on intraspecies interactions, using differently fluorescent tagged but identical or genetically modified strains of the same species. Here, we investigated how physiological differences determine the community composition and spatial distribution in synthetic communities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas protegens and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using quantitative microscopic imaging, we found that interspecies interactions in multispecies colonies are influenced by type IV pilus mediated motility, extracellular matrix secretion, environmental parameters and the specific species involved. These results indicate that the patterns observable in mixed species colonies can be used to understand the mechanisms that drive interspecies interactions, which are dependent on the interplay between specific species physiology and environmental conditions.","Booth, S.; Rice, S.",2020-04-15,Microbiology,10.1101/623017,2,Sean  Booth,University of Oxford,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/623017v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/623017v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1016/j.bioflm.2020.100035
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,72110,MULTICENTER STUDY OF THE BURDEN OF MULTIDRUG-RESISTANT BACTERIA IN THE ETIOLOGY OF INFECTED DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS,"BackgroundInfected diabetic foot ulcer (IDFU) is a public health issue and a leading cause of non-traumatic limb amputation. Very few published data on IDFU is available in most West African countries. The objective of this study was to investigate the etiological agents of IDFU and the challenge of antibacterial drug resistance in the management of infections.\n\nMethodsThis was a prospective cross-sectional hospital-based study involving three tertiary healthcare facilities. Consecutive eligible patients presenting in the facilities were recruited. Tissue biopsies and/or aspirates were collected and cultured on a set of selective and non-selective media and incubated in appropriate atmospheric conditions for 24 to 72 hours. Isolates were identified by established standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using modified Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Specific resistance determinants were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-based protocols. Data analysis was done with SPSS version 20.\n\nResultsNinety patients with clinical diagnosis of DFI were studied between July 2016 and April 2017. A total of 218 microorganisms were isolated, comprising 129 (59.2%) Gram-negative bacilli (GNB), 59 (27.1%) Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and 29 (13.2%) anaerobic bacteria. The top five facultative/aerobic bacteria encountered were: Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter spp. representing 41 (18.8%), 23 (10.5%), 20 (9.2%), 19 (8.7%) and 19 (8.7%) isolates, in that order, respectively. The commonest anaerobes were Bacteroides spp., and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius which accounted for 7 (24.1%) and 6 (20.7%), respectively. Of the 93 IDFU cases, 74 (80%) were infected by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria predominantly methicillin-resistant S. aureus, extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase-producing GNB, mainly of the CTX-M variety. Only 4 (3.1%) GNB were carbapenemase-producers encoded by blaVIM. Factors associated with presence of MDR bacteria were peripheral neuropathy (r= 4.05, P= 0.042) and duration of foot infection >1 month(r= 7.63, P= 0.015).\n\nConclusionsMDR facultative/aerobic bacteria are overrepresented amongst agents causing IDFU. A relatively low proportion of the etiological agents were anaerobic bacteria. This finding should help formulate empirical therapeutic options for managing IDFU. Furthermore, drastic reduction in inappropriate use of cocktail of antibiotics for IDFUs is advocated to combat infection by MDR bacteria in these patients.","Adeyemo, A. T.; Kolawole, B.; Rotimi, V.

Numerous bacteria employ lectins to efficiently bind to epithelia, thus facilitating tissue colonisation. Wounded skin is one of the preferred niches for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has developed diverse strategies to impair tissue repair processes and promote infection.\n\nHere, we analyse the effect of the P. aeruginosa fucose-binding lectin LecB on human keratinocytes and demonstrate that it triggers events in the host, upon binding to fucosylated residues on cell membrane receptors, that extend beyond its role as an adhesion molecule. We found that LecB associates with several growth factor receptors and dampens their signalling pathways, leading to the arrest of cell cycle. Additionally, we describe a novel LecB-triggered mechanism to downregulate host cell receptors by showing that LecB leads to insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 internalisation, without receptor activation, and subsequent missorting towards intracellular endosomal compartments.\n\nOverall, these data highlight that LecB is a multitask virulence factor that, through subversion of several host pathways, has a profound impact on keratinocyte proliferation and survival.","Landi, A.; Mari, M.; Wolf, T.; Kleiser, S.; Gretzmeier, C.; Wilhelm, I.; Kiritsi, D.; Thuenauer, R.; Geiger, R.; Nystroem, A.; Reggiori, F.; Claudinon, J.; Roemer, W.",2019-05-07,Cell Biology,10.1101/629972,1,Winfried  Roemer,"Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg, Freiburg",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629972v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629972v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.26508/lsa.201900422
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,72809,A megaplasmid family responsible for dissemination of multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas,"Multidrug resistance (MDR) represents a global threat to health. Although plasmids can play an important role in the dissemination of MDR, they have not been commonly linked to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance in the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We used whole genome sequencing to characterize a collection of P. aeruginosa clinical isolates from a hospital in Thailand. Using long-read sequence data we obtained complete sequences of two closely related megaplasmids (>420 kb) carrying large arrays of antibiotic resistance genes located in discrete, complex and dynamic resistance regions, and revealing evidence of extensive duplication and recombination events. A comprehensive pangenomic and phylogenomic analysis indicated that 1) these large plasmids comprise a family present in different members of the Pseudomonas genus and associated with multiple sources (geographical, clinical or environmental); 2) the megaplasmids encode diverse niche-adaptive accessory traits, including multidrug resistance; 3) the pangenome of the megaplasmid family is highly flexible and diverse, comprising a substantial core genome (average of 48% of plasmid genes), but with individual members carrying large numbers of unique genes. The history of the megaplasmid family, inferred from our analysis of the available database, suggests that members carrying multiple resistance genes date back to at least the 1970s.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the International Pseudomonas Genomics Consortium, funded by Cystic Fibrosis Canada [RCL]; and the Secretaria de Educacion, Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion (SECTEI), Mexico [AC].","Cazares, A.; Moore, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,73057,Quantitative visualization of gene expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggregates reveals peak expression of alginate in the hypoxic zone,"It is well appreciated that oxygen- and nutrient-limiting gradients characterize microenvironments within chronic infections that foster bacterial tolerance to treatment and the immune response. However, determining how bacteria respond to these microenvironments has been limited by a lack of tools to study bacterial functions at the relevant spatial scales in situ. Here we report the application of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) v3.0 to Pseudomonas aeruginosa aggregates as a step towards this end. As proof-of-principle, we visualize the expression of genes needed for the production of alginate (algD) and the dissimilatory nitrate reductase (narG). Using an inducible bacterial gene expression construct to calibrate the HCR signal, we were able to quantify algD and narG gene expression across microenvironmental gradients both within single aggregates and within aggregate populations using the Agar Block Biofilm Assay (ABBA). For the ABBA population, alginate gene expression was restricted to hypoxic regions within the environment (~40-200 M O2), as measured by an oxygen microelectrode. Within individual biofilm aggregates, cells proximal to the surface expressed alginate genes to a greater extent than interior cells. Lastly, mucoid biofilms consumed more oxygen than nonmucoid biofilms. These results establish that HCR has a sensitive dynamic range and can be used to resolve subtle differences in gene expression at spatial scales relevant to microbial assemblages. Because HCR v3.0 can be performed on diverse cell types, this methodological advance has the potential to enable quantitative studies of microbial gene expression in diverse contexts, including pathogen behavior in human chronic infections.\n\nImportanceThe visualization of microbial activities in natural environments is an important goal for numerous studies in microbial ecology, be the environment a sediment, soil, or infected human tissue. Here we report the application of the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) v3.0 to measure microbial gene expression in situ at single-cell resolution in aggregate biofilms. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a tunable gene expression system, we show that this methodology is quantitative. Leveraging HCR v3.0 to measure gene expression within a P. aeruginosa aggregate, we find that bacteria just below the aggregate surface are the primary cells expressing genes that protect the population against antibiotics and the immune system. This observation suggests that therapies targeting bacteria growing with small amounts of oxygen may be most effective against these hard-to-treat infections. More generally, HCR v3.0 has potential for broad application into microbial activities in situ at small spatial scales.","Jorth, P.; Spero, M.; Newman, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,73257,Quantitative Models of Phage-Antibiotics Combination Therapy,"The spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria is a global public health crisis. Bacteriophage therapy (or \""phage therapy\"") constitutes a potential alternative approach to treat MDR infections. However, the effective use of phage therapy may be limited when phage-resistant bacterial mutants evolve and proliferate during treatment. Here, we develop a nonlinear population dynamics model of combination therapy that accounts for the system-level interactions between bacteria, phage and antibiotics for in-vivo application given an immune response against bacteria. We simulate the combination therapy model for two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one which is phage-sensitive (and antibiotic resistant) and one which is antibiotic-sensitive (and phage-resistant). We find that combination therapy outperforms either phage or antibiotic alone, and that therapeutic effectiveness is enhanced given interaction with innate immune responses. Notably, therapeutic success can be achieved even at sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics, e.g., ciprofloxacin. These in-silico findings provide further support to the nascent application of combination therapy to treat MDR bacterial infections, while highlighting the role of innate immunity in shaping therapeutic outcomes.","Rodriguez-Gonzalez, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,73607,Cryo-EM structure of the MinCD copolymeric filament from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.1 A resolution,"Positioning of the division site in many bacterial species relies on the MinCDE system, which prevents the cytokinetic Z-ring from assembling anywhere but the mid-cell, through an oscillatory diffusion-reaction mechanism. MinD dimers bind to membranes and, via their partner MinC, inhibit the polymerisation of cell division protein FtsZ into the Z-ring. MinC and MinD form polymeric assemblies in solution and on cell membranes. Here, we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the copolymeric filaments of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MinCD. The filaments consist of three protofilaments made of alternating MinC and MinD dimers. The MinCD protofilaments are almost completely straight and assemble as single protofilaments on lipid membranes, which we also visualised by cryo-EM.","Szewczak-Harris, A.; Wagstaff, J.; Lowe, J.",2019-05-15,Molecular Biology,10.1101/638619,1,Jan  Lowe,MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/638619v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/638619v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1002/1873-3468.13471
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,73780,Carbon starvation induces the expression of PprB-regulated genes in Pesudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause severe infections in humans. This bacteria often adopt a biofilm lifestyle that is hard to treat. In several previous studies, the PprA-PprB two-component system (TCS), which controls the expression of type IVb pili, BapA adhesin, and CupE fimbriae, was shown to be involved in biofilm formation. However, signals or environmental conditions that can trigger the PprA-PprB TCS are still unknown, and the molecular mechanisms of PprB-mediated biofilm formation are poorly characterized. Here we report that carbon starvation stress (CCS) can induce the expression of pprB and genes in the PprB regulon. The stress response sigma factor RpoS, rather than the two-component sensor PprA, was determined to mediate the induction of pprB transcription. We also observed a strong negative regulation of PprB to the transcription of itself. Further experiments showed that PprB overexpression greatly enhanced cell-cell adhesion (CCA) and cell-surface adhesion (CSA) in P. aeruginosa. Specially, under the background of PprB overexpression, both of the BapA adhesin and CupE fimbriae displayed positive effect on CCA and CSA, while the type IVb pili showed an unexpected negative effect on CCA and no effect on CSA. In addition, expression of the PprB regulon genes displayed significant increases in 3-day colony biofilms, indicating a possible carbon limitation state in these biofilms. The CSS-RpoS-PprB-Bap/Flp/CupE/Tad pathway identified in this study provides a new perspective on the process of biofilm formation under carbon-limited environments.\n\nIMPORTANCETypically, determining the external signals that can trigger a regulatory system is crucial to understand the regulatory logic and inward function of that system. The PprA-PprB two-component system was reported to be involved in biofilm formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the signals that can trigger this system are unknown. In this study, we found that carbon starvation stress (CSS) can induce the transcription of pprB and genes in PprB regulon, through an RpoS dependent pathway. Increase of PprB expression leads to enhanced cell-cell and cell-surface adhesions in P. aeruginosa, both of which are dependent mainly on the Bap adhesin secretion system and partially on the CupE fimbriae. Our findings suggest that PprB reinforces the structure of biofilms under carbon-limited conditions, and the Bap secretion system and CupE fimbriae are two potential targets for biofilm treatment.","Jin, F.; Wang, C.; Chen, W.; Xia, A.; Zhang, R.; Huang, Y.; Yang, S.; Ni, L.",2019-05-17,Microbiology,10.1101/639112,1,Fan  Jin,University of Science and Technology of China,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/639112v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/639112v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1128/aem.01705-19
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,73789,Synergy pattern of short cationic antimicrobial peptides against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"With the rise of various multi-drug resistance pathogenic bacteria, worldwide health care is under pressure to respond. Conventional antibiotics are failing and the development of novel classes or alternative strategies is a major priority. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) can not only kill multi-drug resistant bacteria, but also can be used synergistically with conventional antibiotics. We selected 30 short AMPs from different origins and measured their synergy in combination with Polymyxin B, Piperacillin, Ceftazidime, Cefepime, Meropenem, Imipenem, Tetracycline, Erythromycin, Kanamycin, Tobramycin, Amikacin, Gentamycin, and Ciprofloxacin. In total 403 unique combinations were tested against a multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate (PA910). As a measure of the synergistic effects, fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) were determined using microdilution assays with FICs ranges between 0.25 and 2. A high number of combinations between peptides and Polymyxin B, Erythromycin and Tetracycline were found to be synergistic. Novel variants of Indolicidin also showed a high frequency in synergist interaction.","Ruden, S.; Rieder, A.; Schwartz, T.; Mikut, R.; Hilpert, K.",2019-05-17,Microbiology,10.1101/639286,1,Ralf  Mikut,Karlsruher Institut of Technologie,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/639286v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/639286v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02740
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,74060,Simple rules govern the diversity of bacterial nicotianamine-like metallophores,"In metal-scarce environments, some pathogenic bacteria produce opine-type metallophores mainly to face the hosts nutritional immunity. This is the case of staphylopine, pseudopaline and yersinopine, identified in Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Yersinia pestis respectively. These metallophores are synthesized by two (CntLM) or three enzymes (CntKLM), CntM catalyzing the last step of biosynthesis using diverse substrates (pyruvate or -ketoglutarate), pathway intermediates (xNA or yNA) and cofactors (NADH or NADPH), depending on the species. Here, we explored substrate specificity of CntM by combining bioinformatics and structural analysis with chemical synthesis and enzymatic studies. We found that NAD(P)H selectivity was mainly due to the amino acid at position 33 (S. aureus numbering) which ensures a preferential binding to NADPH when it is an arginine. Moreover, whereas CntM from P. aeruginosa preferentially uses yNA over xNA, the staphylococcal enzyme is not stereospecific. Most importantly, selectivity towards -ketoacids is largely governed by a single residue at position 150 of CntM (S. aureus numbering): an aspartate at this position ensures selectivity towards pyruvate whereas an alanine leads to the consumption of both pyruvate and -ketoglutarate. Modifying this residue in P. aeruginosa led to a complete reversal of selectivity. Thus, opine-type metallophore diversity is mainly mediated by the absence/presence of a cntK gene encoding a histidine racemase, and the presence of an aspartate/alanine at position 150 of CntM. These two simple rules predict the production of a fourth metallophore by Paenibacillus mucilaginosus, which was confirmed in vitro and called bacillopaline.","Laffont, C.; Brutesco, C.; Hajjar, C.; Cullia, G.; Fanelli, R.; Ouerdane, L.; Cavelier, F.; Arnoux, P.",2019-05-19,Biochemistry,10.1101/641969,1,Pascal  Arnoux,CEA,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/641969v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/641969v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1042/BCJ20190384
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,74632,Fighting antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa with machine learning-enabled molecular diagnostics,"The growing importance of antibiotic resistance on clinical outcomes and cost of care underscores the need for optimization of current diagnostics. For a number of bacterial species antimicrobial resistance can be unambiguously predicted based on their genome sequence. In this study, we sequenced the genomes and transcriptomes of 414 drug-resistant clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. By training machine learning classifiers on information about the presence or absence of genes, their sequence variation, and gene expression profiles, we generated predictive models and identified biomarkers of susceptibility or resistance to four commonly administered antimicrobial drugs. Using these data types alone or in combination resulted in high (0.8-0.9) or very high (>0.9) sensitivity and predictive values, where the relative contribution of the different categories of biomarkers strongly depended on the antibiotic. For all drugs except for ciprofloxacin, gene expression information substantially improved diagnostic performance. Our results pave the way for the development of a molecular resistance profiling tool that reliably predicts antimicrobial susceptibility based on genomic and transcriptomic markers. The implementation of a molecular susceptibility test system in routine clinical microbiology diagnostics holds promise to provide earlier and more detailed information on antibiotic resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens and thus could change how physicians treat bacterial infections.","Khaledi, A.; Weimann, A.; Schniederjans, M.; Asgari, E.; Kuo, T.-H.; Oliver, A.; Cabot, G.; Kola, A.; Gastmeier, P.; Hogardt, M.; Jonas, D.; Mofrad, M.; Bremges, A.; Mchardy, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,74362,Allelic polymorphism shapes community function in evolving Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that chronically infects the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) by forming antibiotic resistant biofilms. Emergence of phenotypically diverse isolates within CF P. aeruginosa populations has previously been reported, however, the impact of heterogeneity on social behaviors and community function is poorly understood. Here we describe how this heterogeneity impacts on behavioral traits by evolving the strain PAO1 in biofilms grown in a synthetic sputum medium for 50 days. We measured social trait production and antibiotic tolerance and used a metagenomic approach to analyze and assess genomic changes over the duration of the evolution experiment. We found that (i) evolutionary trajectories were reproducible in independently evolving populations; (ii) over 60% of genomic diversity occurred within the first 10 days of selection. We then focused on quorum sensing (QS), a well-studied P. aeruginosa trait that is commonly mutated in strains isolated from CF lungs. We found that at the population level (i) evolution in sputum medium selected for decreased production of QS and QS-dependent traits; (ii) there was a significant correlation between lasR mutant frequency, the loss of protease and the 3O-C12-HSL signal, and an increase in resistance to clinically relevant {beta}-lactam antibiotics, despite no previous antibiotic exposure. Overall, our findings provide insights into the effect of allelic polymorphism on community functions in diverse P. aeruginosa populations. Further, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa population and evolutionary dynamics can impact on traits important for virulence and can lead to increased tolerance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics.","Azimi, S.; Roberts, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,74809,Seawater salt-trapped Pseudomonas aeruginosa survives for years and gets primed for salinity tolerance,"BackgroundIn nature, microorganisms have to adapt to long-term stressful conditions often with growth limitations. However, little is known about the evolution of the adaptability of new bacteria to such environments. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, after natural evaporation of seawater, was shown to be trapped in laboratory-grown halite crystals and to remain viable after entrapment for years. However, how this bacterium persists and survives in such hypersaline conditions is not understood.\n\nResultsIn this study, we aimed to understand the basis of survival, and to characterise the physiological changes required to develop salt tolerance using P. aeruginosa as a model. Several clones of P. aeruginosa were rescued after fourteen years in naturally evaporated marine salt crystals. Incubation of samples in nutrient-rich broth allowed re-growth and subsequent plating yielded observable colonies. Whole genome sequencing of the P. aeruginosa isolates confirmed the recovery of the original strain. The re-grown strains, however, showed a new phenotype consisting of an enhanced growth in growing salt concentration compared to the ancestor strain. The intracellular accumulation of K+ was elicited by high concentration of Na+ in the external medium to maintain the homeostasis. Whole transcriptomic analysis by microarray indicated that seventy-eight genes had differential expression between the parental strain and derivative clones. Sixty-one transcripts were up-regulated, while seventeen were down-regulated. Based on a collection of single-gene knockout mutants and gene ontology analysis, we suggest that the adaptive response in P. aeruginosa to hyper-salinity relies on multiple gene product interactions.\n\nConclusionsThe individual gene contributions build up the observed phenotype, but do not ease the identification of salinity-related metabolic pathways. The long-term inclusion of P. aeruginosa in salt crystals primes the bacteria, mediating a readjustment of the bacterial physiology to growth in higher salt concentrations. Our findings provide a starting point to understand how P. aeruginosa, a relevant environmental and pathogenic bacterium, survives to long-term salt stress.","Elabed, H.; Gonzalez-Tortuero, E.; Ibacache-Quiroga, C.; Bakhrouf, A.; Johnston, P.; Gaddour, K.; Blazquez, J.; Rodriguez-Rojas, A.",2019-05-24,Microbiology,10.1101/649152,1,Alexandro  Rodriguez-Rojas,Freie Universitaet Berlin,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649152v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649152v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1186/s12866-019-1499-2
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,75108,Type-3 Secretion System-induced pyroptosis protects Pseudomonas against cell-autonomous immunity,"Inflammasome-induced pyroptosis comprises a key cell-autonomous immune process against intracellular bacteria, namely the generation of dying cell structures. These so-called pore-induced intracellular traps (PITs) entrap and weaken intracellular microbes. However, the immune importance of pyroptosis against extracellular pathogens remains unclear. Here, we report that Type-3 secretion system (T3SS)-expressing Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) escaped PIT immunity by inducing a NLRC4 inflammasome-dependent macrophage pyroptosis response in the extracellular environment. To the contrary, phagocytosis of Salmonella Typhimurium promoted NLRC4-dependent PIT formation and the subsequent bacterial caging. Remarkably, T3SS-deficient Pseudomonas were efficiently sequestered within PIT-dependent caging, which favored exposure to neutrophils. Conversely, both NLRC4 and caspase-11 deficient mice presented increased susceptibility to T3SS-deficient P. aeruginosa challenge, but not to T3SS-expressing P. aeruginosa. Overall, our results uncovered that P. aeruginosa uses its T3SS to overcome inflammasome-triggered pyroptosis, which is primarily effective against intracellular invaders.\n\nImportanceAlthough innate immune components confer host protection against infections, the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) exploits the inflammatory reaction to thrive. Specifically the NLRC4 inflammasome, a crucial immune complex, triggers an Interleukin (IL)-1{beta} and -18 deleterious host response to P. aeruginosa. Here, we provide evidence that, in addition to IL-1 cytokines, P. aeruginosa also exploits the NLRC4 inflammasome-induced pro-inflammatory cell death, namely pyroptosis, to avoid efficient uptake and killing by macrophages. Therefore, our study reveals that pyroptosis-driven immune effectiveness mainly depends on P. aeruginosa localization. This paves the way toward our comprehension of the mechanistic requirements for pyroptosis effectiveness upon microbial infections and may initiate targeted approaches in order to ameliorate the innate immune functions to infections.\n\nGraphical abstractMacrophages infected with T3SS-expressing P. aeruginosa die in a NLRC4-dependent manner, which allows bacterial escape from PIT-mediated cell-autonomous immunity and neutrophil efferocytosis. However, T3SS-deficient P. aeruginosa is detected by both NLRC4 and caspase-11 inflammasomes, which promotes bacterial trapping and subsequent efferocytosis of P. aeruginosa-containing-PITs by neutrophils.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/650333v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e05c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aca55forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d2853org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c275f9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG","Eren, E.; Planes, R.; Buyck, J.

We first identified ancestral forms still present in Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella oneidensis and Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum, characterizing their structures by electron cryotomography and finding evidence that they function in a stress response pathway. Using bioinformatics, we then traced the evolution of the system through {gamma}-Proteobacteria, pinpointing key evolutionary events that led to the machine now seen in E. coli.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,75441,Novel inducers of the expression of multidrug efflux pumps that trigger Pseudomonas aeruginosa transient antibiotic resistance,"The study of the acquisition of antibiotic resistance (AR) has mainly focused in inherited processes, namely mutations and acquisition of AR genes. However, inducible, non-inheritable AR has received less attention and most information in this field derives from the study of antibiotics as inducers of their associated resistance mechanisms. Less is known about non-antibiotic compounds or situations that can induce AR during infection. Multidrug resistance efflux pumps are a category of AR determinants characterized by the tightly regulation of their expression. Their contribution to acquired AR relies in their overexpression. Herein we analyzed potential inducers of the expression of the chromosomally-encoded Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinically-relevant efflux pumps, MexCD-OprJ and MexAB-OprM. For this purpose, we developed a set of luxCDABE-based P. aeruginosa biosensor strains, which allows the high-throughput analysis of compounds able of modifying the expression of these efflux pumps. Using these strains, we analyzed a set of 240 compounds present in Biolog Phenotype Microarrays. Several inducers of the expression of the genes that encode these efflux pumps were found. The study focused in dequalinium chloride, procaine and atropine, compounds that can be found in clinical settings. Using real-time PCR, we confirmed that these compounds indeed induce the expression of mexCD-oprJ. In addition, P. aeruginosa presents lower susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (a MexCD-OprJ substrate) when dequalinium chloride, procaine or atropine are present. This work emphasizes the need of studying compounds that can trigger transient AR during antibiotic treatment, a phenotype difficult to discover using classical susceptibility tests.","Laborda, P.; Alcalde-Rico, M.; Blanco, P.; Martinez, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,75777,Inference of bacterial small RNA regulatory networks and integration with transcription factor driven regulatory networks,"Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) are key regulators of bacterial gene expression. Through complementary base pairing, sRNAs affect messenger RNA stability and translation efficiency. Here, we describe a network inference approach designed to identify sRNA-mediated regulation of transcript levels. We use existing transcriptional datasets and prior knowledge to infer sRNA regulons using our network inference tool, the Inferelator. This approach produces genome-wide gene regulatory networks that include contributions by both transcription factors and sRNAs. We show the benefits of estimating and incorporating sRNA activities into network inference pipelines. We comprehensively assess the accuracy of inferred sRNA regulons using available experimental data. We uncover 30 novel experimentally supported sRNA-mRNA interactions in Escherichia coli, outperforming previous network-based efforts. Our findings expand the role of sRNAs in the regulation of chemotaxis, oxidation-reduction processes, galactose intake, and generation of pyruvate. Additionally, our pipeline complements sequence-based sRNA-mRNA interaction prediction methods by adding a data-driven filtering step. Finally, we show the general applicability of our approach by identifying novel, experimentally supported, sRNA-mRNA interactions in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. Overall, our strategy generates novel insights into the functional implications of sRNA regulation in multiple bacterial species.\n\nIMPORTANCEIndividual bacterial genomes can have dozens of small non-coding RNAs with largely unexplored regulatory functions. Although bacterial sRNAs influence a wide range of biological processes, including antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity, our current understanding of sRNA-mediated regulation is far from complete. Most of the available information is restricted to a few well-studied bacterial species; and even in those species, only partial sets of sRNA targets have been characterized in detail. To close this information gap, we developed a computational strategy that takes advantage of available transcriptional data and knowledge about validated and putative sRNA-mRNA interactions. Our approach facilitates the identification of experimentally supported novel interactions while filtering out false positives. Due to its data-driven nature, our method emerges as an ideal strategy to identify biologically relevant interactions among lists of candidate sRNA-target pairs predicted in silico from sequence analysis or derived from sRNA-mRNA binding experiments.","Arrieta-Ortiz, M.

In this study, we used bioinformatic tools to identify the endolysins ElyA1 and ElyA2 (GH108-PG3 family) present in the genome of bacteriophages Ab1051{Phi} and Ab1052{Phi}, respectively. The muralytic activity of these endolysins over MDR clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae) was tested using the turbidity reduction assay. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of endolysin, colistin and their combination were determined using the microdilution checkerboard method. The antimicrobial activity of the combinations was confirmed by time kill curves and in vivo assays in larvae of Galleria mellonella. Our results showed that ElyA1 displayed activity against all 25 strains of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa tested and against 13 out of 17 strains of K. pneumoniae. No activity was detected when assays were done with endolysin ElyA2. The combined antimicrobial activity of colistin and endolysin ElyA1 yielded a reduction in the colistin MIC for all strains studied, except K. pneumoniae. These results were confirmed in vivo in G. mellonella survival assays. In conclusion, the combination of colistin with new endolysins such as ElyA1 could increase the bactericidal activity and reduce the MIC of the antibiotic, thus also reducing the associated toxicity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe development of multiresistance by pathogen bacteria increases the necessity of the development of new antimicrobial strategies. In this work, we combined the effect of the colistin with a new endolysin, ElyA1, from a bacteriophage present in the clinical strain of Acinetobacter baumannii Ab105. ElyA1 is a lysozyme-like family (GH108-GP3), whose antimicrobial activity was described for first time in this work. Also, another endolysin, ElyA2, with the same origin and family, was characterized but in this case no activity was detected. ElyA1 presented lytic activity over a broad spectrum of strains from A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. When colistin was combined with ElyA1 an increase of the antimicrobial activity was observed with a reduced concentration of colistin, and this observation was also confirmed in vivo in Galleria mellonella larvae. The combination of colistin with new endolysins as ElyA1 could increase the bactericidal activity and lowering the MIC of the antibiotic, thus also reducing the associated toxicity.","Blasco, L.; Ambroa, A.; Trastoy, R.; Perez-Nadales, E.; Fernandez-Cuenca, F.; Torre-Cisneros, J.; Oteo-Iglesias, J.; Oliver, A.; Canton, R.; Kidd, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,76420,Genomic and phenotypic comparison of environmental and patient-derived isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggest that antimicrobial resistance is rare within the environment,"Patient-derived isolates of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa are frequently resistant to antibiotics due to the presence of sequence variants in resistance-associated genes. However, the frequency of antibiotic resistance and of resistance-associated sequence variants in environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa has not been well studied. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, meropenem, tobramycin) of environmental (n=50) and cystic fibrosis (n=42) P. aeruginosa isolates was carried out. Following whole genome sequencing of all isolates, twenty-five resistance-associated genes were analysed for the presence of likely function-altering sequence variants. Environmental isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics with one exception, whereas patient-derived isolates had significant frequencies of resistance to each antibiotic and a greater number of likely resistance-associated genetic variants. These findings indicate that the natural environment does not act as a reservoir of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa, supporting a model in which antibiotic susceptible environmental bacteria infect patients and develop resistance during infection.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d869eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f10c9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@173a576org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17415e8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a5d25_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL","Ramsay, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77015,Pseudomonas aeruginosa increases the sensitivity of biofilm-grown Staphylococcus aureus to membrane-targeting antiseptics and antibiotics,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus often cause chronic, recalcitrant infections in large part due to their ability to form biofilms. The biofilm mode of growth enables these organisms to withstand antibacterial insults that would effectively eliminate their planktonic counterparts. We found that P. aeruginosa supernatant increased the sensitivity of S. aureus biofilms to multiple antimicrobial compounds, including fluoroquinolones and membrane-targeting antibacterial agents, including the antiseptic chloroxylenol. Treatment of S. aureus with the antiseptic chloroxylenol alone did not decrease biofilm cell viability; however, the combination of chloroxylenol and P. aeruginosa supernatant led to a 4-log reduction in S. aureus biofilm viability compared to exposure to chloroxylenol alone. We found that the P. aeruginosa-produced small molecule 2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO) is responsible for the observed heightened sensitivity of S. aureus to chloroxylenol. Similarly, HQNO increased the susceptibility of S. aureus biofilms to other compounds, including both traditional and non-traditional antibiotics, which permeabilize bacterial membranes. Genetic and phenotypic studies support a model whereby HQNO causes an increase in S. aureus membrane fluidity, thereby improving the efficacy of membrane-targeting antiseptics and antibiotics. Importantly, our data show that P. aeruginosa exoproducts can enhance the ability of various antimicrobial agents to kill biofilm populations of S. aureus that are typically difficult to eradicate, providing a path for the discovery of new biofilm-targeting antimicrobial strategies.\n\nImportanceThe thick mucus in the airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients predisposes them to frequent, polymicrobial respiratory infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are frequently co-isolated from the airways of individuals with CF, as well as from diabetic foot ulcers and other wounds. Both organisms form biofilms, which are notoriously difficult to eradicate and promote chronic infection. In this study, we have shown P. aeruginosa secreted factors can increase the efficacy of compounds that alone have little or no bactericidal activity against S. aureus biofilms. In particular, we discovered that P. aeruginosa exoproducts can potentiate the anti-staphylococcal activity of phenol-based antiseptics and other membrane-active drugs, including non-traditional antibiotics. Our findings illustrate that polymicrobial interactions can dramatically increase antibacterial efficacy in vitro, and may guide new approaches to target persistent infections, such as those commonly found in respiratory tract infections and in chronic wounds.","Orazi, G.; Ruoff, K.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77062,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ethanol oxidation by AdhA in low oxygen environments,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a broad metabolic repertoire that facilitates its co-existence with different microbes. Many microbes secrete products that P. aeruginosa can then catabolize, including ethanol, a common fermentation product. Here, we show that under oxygen limiting conditions P. aeruginosa utilizes AdhA, an NAD-linked alcohol dehydrogenase, as a previously undescribed means for ethanol catabolism. In a rich medium containing ethanol, AdhA, but not the previously described PQQ-linked alcohol dehydrogenase, ExaA, oxidizes ethanol and leads to the accumulation of acetate in culture supernatants. AdhA-dependent acetate accumulation, and the accompanying decrease in pH, promotes P. aeruginosa survival in LB-grown stationary phase cultures. The transcription of adhA is elevated by hypoxia and in anoxic conditions, and we show that it is regulated by the Anr transcription factor. We have shown that lasR mutants have higher levels of Anr-regulated transcripts in low oxygen conditions compared to their wild type counterparts. Here, we show that a lasR mutant, when grown with ethanol, has an even larger decrease in pH than WT that is dependent on both anr and adhA. The large increase in AdhA activity similar to that of a strain expressing a hyperactive Anr-D149A variant. Ethanol catabolism in P. aeruginosa by AdhA supports growth on ethanol as a sole carbon source and electron donor in oxygen-limited settings and in cells growing by denitrification in anoxic conditions. This is the first demonstration of a physiological role for AdhA in ethanol oxidation in P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportanceEthanol is a common product of microbial fermentation, and the Pseudomonas aeruginosa response to and utilization of ethanol is relevant to our understanding of its role in microbial communities. Here, we report that the putative alcohol dehydrogenase, AdhA, is responsible for ethanol catabolism and acetate accumulation in low oxygen conditions and that it is regulated by Anr.","Crocker, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77581,CRISPR-Cas immunity repressed by a biofilm-activating pathway in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"CRISPR-Cas systems are adaptive immune systems that protect bacteria from bacteriophage (phage) infection. To provide immunity, RNA-guided protein surveillance complexes recognize foreign nucleic acids, triggering their destruction by Cas nucleases. While the essential requirements for immune activity are well understood, the physiological cues that regulate CRISPR-Cas expression are not. Here, a forward genetic screen identifies a two-component system (KinB/AlgB), previously characterized in regulating Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence and biofilm establishment, as a regulator of the biogenesis and activity of the Type I-F CRISPR-Cas system. Downstream of the KinB/AlgB system, activators of biofilm production AlgU (a {sigma}E orthologue) and AlgR, act as repressors of CRISPR-Cas activity during planktonic and surface-associated growth. AmrZ, another biofilm activator, functions as a surface-specific repressor of CRISPR-Cas immunity. Pseudomonas phages and plasmids have taken advantage of this regulatory scheme, and carry hijacked homologs of AmrZ, which are functional CRISPR-Cas repressors. This suggests that while CRISPR-Cas regulation may be important to limit self-toxicity, endogenous repressive pathways represent a vulnerability for parasite manipulation.","Borges, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77531,A large-scale comparison shows that genetic changes causing antibiotic resistance in experimentally evolved Pseudomonas aeruginosa predict those in naturally evolved bacteria,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of acute and chronic infections. An increasing number of isolates have acquired mutations that make them antibiotic resistant, making treatment more difficult. To identify resistance-associated mutations we experimentally evolved the antibiotic sensitive strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 to become resistant to three widely used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics, ciprofloxacin, meropenem and tobramycin. Mutants were able to tolerate up to 2048-fold higher concentrations of antibiotic than strain PAO1. Genome sequences were determined for thirteen mutants for each antibiotic. Each mutant had between 2 and 8 mutations. There were at least 8 genes mutated in more than one mutant per antibiotic, demonstrating the complexity of the genetic basis of resistance. Additionally, large deletions of up to 479kb arose in multiple meropenem resistant mutants. For all three antibiotics mutations arose in genes known to be associated with resistance, but also in genes not previously associated with resistance. To determine the clinical relevance of mutations uncovered in experimentally-evolved mutants we analysed the corresponding genes in 457 isolates of P. aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis as well as 172 isolates from the general environment. Many of the genes identified through experimental evolution had changes predicted to be function-altering in clinical isolates but not in isolates from the general environment, showing that mutated genes in experimentally evolved bacteria can predict those that undergo mutation during infection. These findings expand understanding of the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa as well as demonstrating the validity of experimental evolution in identifying clinically-relevant resistance-associated mutations.\n\nImportanceThe rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria represents an impending global health crisis. As such, understanding the genetic mechanisms underpinning this resistance can be a crucial piece of the puzzle to combatting it. The importance of this research is that by experimentally evolving P. aeruginosa to three clinically relevant antibiotics, we have generated a catalogue of genes that can contribute to resistance in vitro. We show that many (but not all) of these genes are clinically relevant, by identifying variants in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. This research furthers our understanding of the genetics leading to resistance in P. aeruginosa and provides tangible evidence that these genes can play a role clinically, potentially leading to new druggable targets or inform therapies.","Wardell, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77694,The SiaABC threonine phosphorylation pathway controls biofilm formation in response to carbon availability in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"The critical role of bacterial biofilms in chronic human infections calls for novel anti-biofilm strategies targeting the regulation of biofilm development. However, the regulation of biofilm development is very complex and can include multiple, highly interconnected signal transduction/response pathways, which are incompletely understood. We demonstrated previously that in the opportunistic, human pathogen P. aeruginosa, the PP2C-like protein phosphatase SiaA and the di-guanylate cyclase SiaD control the formation of macroscopic cellular aggregates, a type of suspended biofilms, in response to surfactant stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the SiaABC proteins represent a signal response pathway that functions through a partner switch mechanism to control biofilm formation. We also demonstrate that SiaABCD functionality is dependent on carbon substrate availability for a variety of substrates, and that upon carbon starvation, SiaB mutants show impaired dispersal, in particular with the primary fermentation product ethanol. This suggests that carbon availability is at least one of the key environmental cues integrated by the SiaABCD system. Further, our biochemical, physiological and crystallographic data reveals that the phosphatase SiaA and its kinase counterpart SiaB balance the phosphorylation status of their target protein SiaC at threonine 68 (T68). Crystallographic analysis of the SiaA-PP2C domain shows that SiaA is present as a dimer. Dynamic modelling of SiaA with SiaC suggested that SiaA interacts strongly with phosphorylated SiaC and dissociates rapidly upon dephosphorylation of SiaC. Further, we show that the known phosphatase inhibitor fumonisin inhibits SiaA mediated phosphatase activity in vitro. In conclusion, the present work improves our understanding of how P. aeuruginosa integrates specific environmental conditions, such as carbon availability and surfactant stress, to regulate cellular aggregation and biofilm formation. With the biochemical and structural characterization of SiaA, initial data on the catalytic inhibition of SiaA, and the interaction between SiaA and SiaC, our study identifies promising targets for the development of biofilm-interference drugs to combat infections of this aggressive opportunistic pathogen.

Author SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative bacterium that is feared within clinical environments due to its potential to cause life-threatening acute and chronic infections. One cornerstone of its success is the ability to form and disperse from biofilms, which are self-made, multicellular structures that protect the individual cell from the human immune system and antibiotic treatment. As such, therapies that combine a biofilm-interference strategy and the use of antimicrobial drugs represent one of the promising strategies to tackle infections of this organism. With the current study, we gain a deeper understanding of the SiaABCD mediated biofilm formation in response to clinically relevant environmental conditions. Further, our structural and biochemical characterization of the PP2C-type protein-phosphatase SiaA and the partner switch protein SiaC suggest that both represent promising novel targets for the development of future anti-biofilms drugs based on a signal interference strategy.","Poh, W.-H.; Lin, J.; Colley, B.; Müller, N.; Goh, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77628,Interkingdom Signal Indole Inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa Persister Cell Waking,"AimsPersister cells are stressed cells that have transient tolerance to antibiotics; these cells undergo no genetic change, but instead, their tolerance is due to reduced metabolism. Unfortunately, little is known about how persisters resuscitate, so we explored the waking of a cells in the presence of the interkingdom signal indole.\n\nMethods and ResultsTo generate a large population of persister cells, we induced the persister phenotype in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa by pre-treating cells with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone to reduce translation by depleting ATP levels, and found, via single cell observations, that proline is sufficient to wake the persister cells. P. aeruginosa is often present in the gastrointestinal tract, and indole from commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli has been shown to inhibit P. aeruginosa quorum sensing and pathogenicity without influencing growth. Furthermore, indole is not toxic to P. aeruginosa persister cells. However, we find here that physiological concentrations of indole inhibit P. aeruginosa persister cell resuscitation with an efficiency of higher than 95%. Critically, when contacted with E. coli stationary phase cultures, the indole produced by E. coli completely inhibits persister cell resuscitation of P. aeruginosa.\n\nConclusionsTherefore, E. col has devised a method to outcompete its competitors by preventing their resuscitation with indole.\n\nSignificanceThis work provides insight into why indole is produced by commensal bacteria.","Zhang, W.; Yamasaki, R.; Wood, T.

We investigated the biofilm inhibitor taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) and its effects on the specialized metabolism, virulence and biofilm formation of the clinically relevant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PA14. Our study shows that TLCA alters specialized metabolism, thereby affecting P. aeruginosa colony biofilm physiology. We observed an upregulation of metabolites correlated to virulence such as the siderophore pyochelin. A wax moth virulence assay confirmed that treatment with TLCA increases virulence of P. aeruginosa. Based on our results, we believe that future endeavors to identify biofilm inhibitors must consider how a putative lead is altering the specialized metabolism of a bacterial community to prevent pathogens from entering a highly virulent state.","Condren, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,77792,Host mucin is subverted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during infection to provide free glycans required for successful colonization,"The mucosal barrier, found lining epithelial cells, serves multiple functions in a range of animals. The major structural components of mucus are mucins, which are heavily glycosylated proteins that are either membrane bound or secreted by the epithelial cells. Mucins are key components of the innate immune system, as they are involved in the clearance of pathogens from the airways and intestines, and their expression is typically upregulated upon epithelial cell exposure to a variety of pathogens. In this study, we identified the mucin MUL-1 as an innate immune factor that appears to be utilized by P. aeruginosa to colonize hosts. We found that while the expression of several mucins, including MUL-1, increased upon P. aeruginosa infection of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, silencing of or deletion of mul-1 resulted in enhanced survival and reduced bacterial accumulation. P. aeruginosa required host sialidase CTSA-1.1 to use mucin-derived glycans to colonize the host, while sialidase-encoding bacteria required host MUL-1 but not CTSA-1.1 to cause a lethal infection. This role of mucins and free glycans in host-pathogen interaction appears to be conserved from C. elegans to humans, as P. aeruginosa binding to human lung epithelial cells was also enhanced in the presence of free glycans, and free glycans reversed the binding defect of P. aeruginosa to human lung cells lacking the mucin MUC1.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe gastrointestinal, respiratory, reproductive, and urinary tracts, are large surfaces exposed to the exterior environment and thus, these mucosal epithelial tissues serve as primary routes of infection. One of the first lines of defense present at these barriers is mucus, which is a highly viscous material formed by mucin glycoproteins. Mucins serve various functions, but importantly they aid in the clearance of pathogens and debris from epithelial barriers and serve as innate immune effectors. In this study, we describe the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to utilize mucin-derived glycans to colonize the intestine and ultimately cause death in Caenorhabditis elegans. We also show conserved mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence traits, by demonstrating that free glycans alter the ability of the bacteria to bind to human lung alveolar epithelial cells. Over the course of host-pathogen evolution, pathogens seem to have evolved to use mucins for their own advantage, and thus one of the biggest questions is which party benefits from pathogen-mucin binding. By gaining a better understanding of pathogen-mucin interactions, we can better protect against pathogen infection.","Hoffman, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,78031,"Comprehensive genome data analysis establishes a triple whammy of carbapenemases, ICEs and multiple clinically-relevant bacteria","Carbapenemases inactivate most {beta}-lactam antibiotics, including carbapenems and have been frequently reported among Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Traditionally, the horizontal gene transfer of carbapenemase encoding genes (CEGs) has been linked to plasmids. However, given that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are possibly the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes, we conducted an in-silico analysis to ascertain the likely role of ICEs in the spread of CEGs among all bacterial genomes (n=182,663). We detected 17,520 CEGs, of which 66 were located within putative ICEs among several bacterial species (including clinically-relevant bacteria as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). Most CEGs detected within ICEs belong to the IMP, NDM and SPM metallo-beta-lactamase families, and the serine beta-lactamase KPC and GES families. Different mechanisms were likely responsible for acquisition of these genes. The majority of CEG-bearing ICEs belong to the MPFG, MPFT and MPFF classes and often encode resistance to other antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones). This study provides a snapshot of the different CEGs associated with ICEs among available bacterial genomes and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of ICEs to the spread of carbapenem resistance globally.

Author NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.

Impact StatementCarbapenems are commonly used to treat severe infections in humans. Resistance is often mediated by carbapenemases. These enzymes degrade carbapenems and are frequently present in plasmids. Here, we demonstrate that common carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) found in clinical isolates (e.g. blaKPC, blaGES, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaVIM) can also be located within integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). CEG-bearing ICEs belong to three mating-pair formation families. These mobile elements may be particularly important in bacteria where plasmids do not seem to play a significant role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes, as Pseudomonas spp. This study considerably expands the knowledge of the repertoire of CEGs-bearing ICEs among clinically-relevant bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,78181,Integrative omics analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virus PA5oct highlights the molecular complexity of jumbo phages,"Pseudomonas virus vB_PaeM_PA5oct is a compelling model phage to investigate phage-bacteria interactions and is a potent candidate for phage therapy. Combining hybrid genome sequencing, RNA-Seq, and mass spectrometry of virion-associated proteins allowed us to accurately assemble and annotate PA5octs 286,783 bp genome. It encodes 461 coding regions, of which 93 were identified as virion-associated proteins using ESI-MS/MS. RNA-seq revealed twelve tRNA genes, four ncRNA regions, and a gradual take-over of the total cell transcriptome from 21% in early infection to 93% in late infection. Although PA5oct is not organized into strictly contiguous regions of temporal transcription, defined genomic regions are expressed in early, middle, and late phases of infection. Interestingly, we observed distinct regions showing limited transcription activity throughout the infection cycle. The infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by PA5oct triggers the upregulation of bacterial operons related to NAD biosynthesis, Psl exopolysaccharide, and periplasmic nitrate reductase production and downregulates Type IV pili gene products, suggesting mechanisms of superinfection exclusion. We used the proteome of PA5oct to position this isolate amongst other phages using a protein-sharing network.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,78861,Diagnostic optical sequencing,"Advances in precision medicine require high-throughput, inexpensive, point-of-care diagnostic methods with multi-omics capability for detecting a wide range of biomolecules and their molecular variants. Optical techniques have offered many promising advances towards such diagnostics. However, the inability to squeeze light with several hundred-nanometer wavelengths into angstrom-scale volume for single nucleotide measurements has hindered further progress. Recently, a block optical sequencing (BOS) method has been shown for determining relative nucleobase content in DNA k-mer blocks with Raman spectroscopy, and a block optical content scoring (BOCS) algorithm was developed for robust content-based genetic biomarker database searching. Here, we performed BOS measurements on positively-charged silver nanoparticles to achieve 93.3% accuracy for predicting nucleobase content in DNA k-mer blocks (where k=10), as well as measurements on RNA and chemically-modified nucleobases for extensions to transcriptomic and epigenetic studies. Our high-accuracy BOS measurements were then used with BOCS to correctly identify a {beta}-lactamase gene from the MEGARes antibiotic resistance database and confirm the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogen of origin from <12 content measurements (<15% coverage) of the gene. These results prove the integration of BOS/BOCS as a diagnostic optical sequencing platform. With the versatile range of available plasmonic substrates offering simple data acquisition, varying resolution (single-molecule to ensemble), and multiplexing, this optical sequencing platform has potential as the rapid, cost-effective method needed for broad-spectrum biomarker detection.","Korshoj, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79020,Ranking of Major Classes of Antibiotics for Activity against Stationary Phase Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Identification of Clinafloxacin + Cefuroxime + Gentamicin Drug Combination that Eradicates Persistent P. aeruginosa Infection in a Murine Cystic Fibrosis Model,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause serious persistent infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, sepsis, biofilm-related infections as in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although CF lung infections can be treated with antibiotics, full clearance is difficult due to P. aeruginosa persistence. While antibiotic activity against growing P. aeruginosa is well documented, their activity against the non-growing persisters enriched in stationary phase cultures has not been well studied. Here, we systematically evaluated and ranked the six major classes of antibiotics, cell wall and cell membrane inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, DNA synthesis inhibitors, RNA synthesis inhibitors, sulfa drugs, and nitrofurantoin, for their activity against both growing and persister forms of P. aeruginosa using colony forming count (CFU) and SYBR Green I/Propidium Iodide (PI) viability assay. Among the six major classes of antibiotics, cell wall and cell membrane inhibitors (Cefuroxime and Colistin), DNA synthesis inhibitors (Clinafloxacin) and sulfa drugs (Sulfamethoxazole) had good activity against stationary phase cells. In contrast, protein synthesis inhibitors (Gentamicin), RNA synthesis inhibitor (Rifampicin) and Nitrofurantoin had relatively poor activity against the stationary phase P. aeruginosa but relatively high activity against log phase P. aeruginosa. Clinafloxacin is the only single drug that could completely kill all (109 CFU) stationary phase cells in a 4 day drug exposure. The Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Clinafloxacin combination could kill all biofilm bacteria in 2 days whereas the clinically used drug combination Cefuroxime + Gentamicin + Colistin only partially killed the biofilm bacteria with 103 CFU remaining. In a murine persistent CF lung infection model, only Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Clinafloxacin cleared all bacteria in the infected lungs, whereas Clinafloxacin alone, or Cefuroxime + Clinafloxacin, or the current recommended drug combination Cefuroxime + Gentamicin, all failed to completely clear the bacterial load in the lungs. The complete sterilization of the bacterial load is a property of Clinafloxacin combination, as Cefuroxime + Gentamicin+ Levofloxacin combination was unable to clear the bacterial load in the lungs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of persister drug clinafloxacin, offer new therapeutic approaches for more effective treatment of persistent P. aeruginosa infections, and may have implications for treating other persistent infections.","Yuan, Y.; Yee, R.; Gour, N.; Dong, X.; Feng, J.; Shi, W.; Zhang, Y.",2019-06-30,Microbiology,10.1101/686105,1,Ying  Zhang,Johns Hopkins University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/686105v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/686105v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79077,The origin of extracellular DNA in bacterial biofilm infections in vivo,"Extracellular DNA (eDNA) plays an important role in both the aggregation of bacteria and in the interaction of the resulting biofilms with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) during an inflammatory response. Here, transmission electron and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to examine the interaction between biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and PMNs in a murine implant model and in lung tissue from chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients. PNA FISH, DNA staining, labeling of PMN DNA with a thymidine analogue, and immunohistochemistry were applied to localize bacteria, eDNA, PMN-derived eDNA, PMN-derived histone H3 (H3), neutrophil elastase (NE), and citrullinated H3 (citH3). Host-derived eDNA was observed surrounding bacterial aggregates but not within the biofilms. H3 localized to the lining of biofilms while NE was found throughout biofilms. CitH3, a marker for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was detected only sporadically indicating that most host-derived eDNA in vivo was not a result of NETosis. Together these observations show that, in these in vivo biofilm infections with P. aeruginosa, the majority of eDNA is found external to the biofilm and derives from the host.\n\nAuthor summaryThe role of extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been described in vitro to play a major role in biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance, but never for biofilm infections in vivo.\n\nTwo important characteristics of human chronic bacterial infections are aggregated bacteria and white blood cells (WBC). Bacteria use eDNA to stabilize biofilms and WBC use eDNA to trap bacteria. Given the importance of eDNA for both bacteria and WBC we show here for the first time that bacterial biofilms do not co-localize with either bacterial or WBC-derived eDNA during chronic infections. Our in vivo findings show eDNA is located outside biofilms as opposed to incorporated within the biofilm as commonly observed in vitro.\n\nWe believe that understanding the interplay between biofilms and WBC during chronic infection is essential if we are to elucidate the mechanisms underlying persistent infection and ascertain why WBC fail to eradicate bacteria; this will enable us to develop new treatment strategies.","Alhede, M.; Alhede, M.; Qvortrup, K.; Kragh, K.; Jensen, P.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79458,Comparison of biofilm dispersal approaches in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evaluation of dispersed cells in acute infection mouse model,"Biofilm dispersal is biologically significant process to fully understand its consequences during biofilm based infections. The mechanism for biofilm dispersal may involve response to environmental cues and changes in intracellular secondary messengers. Considering range of cues for biofilm dispersal, it is significant to study if dispersed cells generated by different methods have similar phenotype. In the present study, we have compared four type of biofilm dispersal in P. aeruginosa based in response to environment cues (starvation and nutrient rich), c-di-GMP knockdown and signaling molecule NO. We have determined their dispersal efficiency, susceptibility of dispersed cells for antibiotics, their transcriptomic changes compared to planktonic and biofilm. We also determined if dispersed cells can cause acute infections in mouse models. In vitro experiments showed that NO and c-di-GMP based dispersal methods had high biofilm reduction efficiency of 50 and 75% respectively, however, the nutrient induced dispersion showed low efficiency ({approx}30%) and more tolerance to colistin. We also showed that in vitro dispersed cells induced >10-fold transcriptomic expression of genes (at significance level of p < 0.005) related to efflux pumps (mexCD-oprJ), antibiotic resistance (arnDET) in dispersed cells induced by NO and nutrient change, while denitrification pathway and virulence (T3SS, VreI, T2SS) genes in all dispersed cells compared to planktonic and biofilm state. When the ability of the dispersed cells was tested in mouse model of lung infection, c-di-GMP and NO based dispersed cells displayed enhanced infections and haematogenous spread to liver and spleen and higher mortality. Although degree of immune response (cytokines) does not differ based on phenotypes inoculated in our experimental conditions. Based on our data most efficient dispersal methods increase murine mortality. This indicates their capability of making biofilm associated infection more complicated. Our data encourage to be more careful for studies suggesting biofilm dispersal during treatment of biofilm infections.","Ruhal, R.; De Winter, F.; De Jonger, B.; Xavier, B.

We designed a convolutional neural network to perform combined classification and regression on peptide sequences to quantitatively predict AMP activity against Escherichia coli. Our predictions outperformed the state of the art at AMP classification and were also effective at regression, for which there were no publicly available comparisons.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79724,Comparative genome analysis of a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa sequence type 277 clone that harbours two copies of the blaSPM-1 gene and multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms in other resistance-associated genes,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common pathogens related to healthcare-associated infections. The Brazilian isolate, named CCBH4851, is a multidrug-resistant clone belonging to the sequence type 277. The antimicrobial resistance mechanisms of the CCBH4851 strain are associated with the presence of blaSPM-1 gene, encoding a metallo-beta-lactamase, in addition to other exogenously acquired genes. Whole-genome sequencing studies focusing on emerging pathogens are essential to identify physiological key aspects that may lead to the exposure of new targets for therapy. This study was designed to characterize the genome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCBH4851 through the detection of genomic features and genome comparison with other Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. The CCBH4851 closed genome showed features that were consistent with data reported for the specie. However, comparative genomics revealed the absence of genes important for pathogenesis. On the other hand, CCBH4851 genome contained acquired genomic islands that carry additional virulence and antimicrobial resistance-related genes. The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the core genome, mainly those located in resistance-associated genes, suggests that these mutations could influence the multidrug-resistant behavior of CCBH4851. Overall, the characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCBH4851 complete genome revealed several features that could directly impact the profile of virulence and antibiotic resistance of this pathogen in infectious outbreaks.","Nascimento, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79700,"Insights into the bacterial profiles and resistome structures following severe 2018 flood in Kerala, South India","Extreme flooding is one of the major risk factors for human health, and it can significantly influence the microbial communities and enhance the mobility of infectious disease agents within its affected areas. The flood crisis in 2018 was one of the severe natural calamities recorded in the southern state of India (Kerala) that significantly affected its economy and ecological habitat. We utilized a combination of shotgun metagenomics and bioinformatics approaches for understanding microbiome disruption and the dissemination of pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria on flooded sites. Here we report, altered bacterial profiles at the flooded sites having 77 significantly different bacterial genera in comparison with non-flooded mangrove settings. The flooded regions were heavily contaminated with faecal contamination indicators such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhi/Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. The resistome of the flooded sites contains 103 resistant genes, of which 38% are encoded in plasmids, where most of them are associated with pathogens. The presence of 6 pathogenic bacteria and its susceptibility to multiple antibiotics including ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and tetracycline hydrochloride were confirmed in flooded and post-flooded sites using traditional culture-based analysis followed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Our results reveal altered bacterial profile following a devastating flood event with elevated levels of both faecal contamination indicators and resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria. The circulation of raw sewage from waste treatment settings and urban area might facilitate the spreading of pathogenic bacteria and resistant genes.","Jaya Divakaran, S.; Sara Philip, J.; Chereddy, P.; Nori, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,79809,HORMA domain proteins and a Pch2-like ATPase regulate bacterial cGAS-like enzymes to mediate bacteriophage immunity,"Bacteria are continually challenged by foreign invaders including bacteriophages, and have evolved a variety of defenses against these invaders. Here, we describe the structural and biochemical mechanisms of a bacteriophage immunity pathway found in a broad array of bacteria, including pathogenic E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This pathway employs eukaryotic-like HORMA domain proteins that recognize specific peptides, then bind and activate a cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) to generate a cyclic tri-AMP (cAAA) second messenger; cAAA in turn activates an endonuclease effector, NucC. Signaling is attenuated by a homolog of the AAA+ ATPase Pch2/TRIP13, which binds and likely disassembles the active HORMA-CD-NTase complex. When expressed in non-pathogenic E. coli, this pathway confers immunity against bacteriophage {lambda} infection. Our findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense pathway integrating a cGAS-like nucleotidyltransferase with HORMA domain proteins for threat sensing through protein detection, and negative regulation by a Pch2-like ATPase.","Ye, Q.; Lau, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,80246,Cross-kingdom recognition of bacterial small RNAs induces transgenerational pathogenic avoidance,"We recently discovered that C. elegans can pass on a learned avoidance of pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) to four generations of its progeny. This transgenerational inheritance is bacterial species-specific, but how C. elegans recognizes and distinguishes different bacteria and transmits this information to future generations is not apparent. Here we show that small RNAs purified from pathogenic PA14 are sufficient not only to induce avoidance of pathogens in mothers, but also to confer transgenerational inheritance of this species-specific behavior for four generations, all without direct contact with pathogenic bacteria. This behavior requires the small RNA transporters SID-1 and SID-2, RNA interference pathway components, the piRNA Piwi/Argonaute pathway, a functioning germline, and TGF-{beta} ligand daf-7 expression in the ASI sensory neuron. Our results suggest that C. elegans \""reads\"" small RNAs expressed by pathogenic bacteria, and uses this information to induce an escape behavior that lasts for four additional generations. C. elegans may have evolved this trans-kingdom signaling system to avoid pathogens in abundant classes of bacteria in its environment and its microbiome.","Kaletsky, R.; Moore, R. S.; Parsons, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,80282,Differential impact on motility and biofilm dispersal of closely related phosphodiesterases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Bacteria typically occur either as free-swimming planktonic cells or within a sessile, biofilm mode of growth. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transition between these lifestyles is known to be modulated by the intracellular secondary messenger cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP). We are interested in the control of distinct biofilm-relevant phenotypes in P. aeruginosa through the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP. Here, we characterise motility and associated biofilm formation and dispersal in two pairs of related multi-domain proteins with putative c-di-GMP turnover domains, selected to contain additional PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) homology domains known for their ability to process environmental stimuli. The enzymes PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 have distinct functions despite their similar domain structures. The {Delta}rbdA deletion mutant showed significantly increased biofilm formation while biofilm formation was impaired in {Delta}PA2072. Using a GFP transcriptional reporter fused to the cyclic di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter, we show correlation between biofilm phenotype and c-di-GMP levels. Both proteins are shown to play a role in nitric oxide (NO) induced biofilm dispersal. We further studied pseudo-enzymes of similar architecture. PA5017 (DipA) is an inactive cyclase, and PA4959 (FimX) is described here as an inactive cyclase/phosphodiesterase. Loss of swimming and twitching motilities, respectively, is observed in deletion variants, which correlated with NO-induced biofilm dispersal phenotypes, as {Delta}dipA dispersed less well while {Delta}fimX dispersed better than wild type. The study highlights how Pseudomonas differentiates c-di-GMP output - in this case motility - using structurally very similar proteins and underlines a significant role for pseudo-enzymes in motility regulation and associated biofilm dispersal.\n\nImportanceBacterial biofilms exert pervasive economic and societal impact across a range of environmental, engineered and clinical contexts. The secondary messenger cyclic guanosine di-phosphate, c-di-GMP, is known to control the ability of many bacteria to form biofilms. The opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 has 38 putative enzymes that can regulate c-di-GMP turnover, and these proteins modulate various cellular functions and influence bacterial lifestyle. The specific protein sensory domains and mechanisms of motility that lead to biofilm dispersal remain to be fully understood. Here we studied multi-domain proteins with the PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) homology domains, these being classic sensors to environmental stimuli. Our study demonstrates the significant roles for the pseudo-enzymes PA4959 (FimX) and PA5017 (DipA) in regulation of biofilm phenotype and motility. Further, enzymes with highly homologous structures, such as PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072, have almost orthogonal function in biofilm and motility control.","Cai, Y.-M.; Hutchin, A.; Craddock, J.; Walsh, M.

In resource limited settings, there is paucity of data on predictors of outcome in patients with BSI. This study aimed at examining the predictors of mortality in patients with BSI as well as bacteria causing BSI.\n\nMethods and MaterialsThis was cross-sectional study conducted in Muhimbili National Hospital between April and May 2018. Blood culture results from all inpatients at clinical microbiology laboratory were recorded and clinical information were retrieved retrospectively from the files. Bacteria from positive blood culture were identified and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed.\n\nResultsThe overall prevalence of BSI was 11.4% (46/402), with case fatality rate of 37%. There was significant high rate of BSI in patient who had died compared to those survived p= 0.008. Gram-negative bacteria (74%) were the common cause of BSI, with predominance of Enterobacteriaceae (22), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (11). Majority (70.5%) of the bacteria isolated from patients with BSI were multi-drug resistant. Forty six percent of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistance to meropenem. Sixty eight percent 68.2% (15/22) of Enterobacteriaceae were ESBL producers. Carbapenemases production were detected in 27% (3/11) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and in one Proteus mirabillis. Forty percent (40%) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,81993,Biofilm Associated Genotypes of Multidrug-Resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous environmental microorganism that is also a common cause of nosocomial infections that vary in severity from chronic wound infections to pneumonia, bloodstream infections and sepsis. Its ability to survive in many different environments and persistently colonize human tissue is linked to its presence within biofilms that form on indwelling device surfaces such as plastics and stainless steel. Biofilm promotes bacterial adhesion and survival on surfaces, reduces susceptibility to desiccation, and the actions of antibiotics and disinfectants. Recent genome sequencing studies demonstrate that P. aeruginosa is a highly diverse species with a very large pan-genome consistent with its adaptability to differing environments. However, most MDR infections are caused by a small number of \""high-risk\"" clones or lineages that recently emerged and spread globally.\n\nIn our 2017 study of the resistome of P. aeruginosa we confirmed the power of genome-wide association (GWAS) techniques to explore the genetic basis of several antibiotic resistance phenotypes and discovered 46 novel putative resistance polymorphisms. In this study we sought to examine genetic associations within a subset of these isolates with simple biofilm phenotypes. We examined the genetic basis for biofilm production on polystyrene at room temperature (22{degrees}C) and body temperature (37{degrees}C) within a total of 280 isolates. 69% of isolates (n=193) produced more biofilm mass at 22{degrees}C, whilst those producing more biofilm at 37{degrees}C had reduced optical density 540 variation. We found statistically significant associations with IpxO and other genes associated with arsenic resistance to be significantly associated with this trait. IpxO which encodes a lipid A hydroxylase and arsenic reduction genes have previously been found to be associated with biofilm production in this species. We analyzed 260 ST111 and ST235 genomes and found considerable genetic variation between isolates in their content of genes previously found associated with biofilm production. This is indicative of a highly variable and flexible population within these clades with frequent emergence of successful sub-lineages. Analysis of 48 of these isolates ability to form biofilm on stainless steel surfaces showed that a  good biofilm-forming phenotype had significant intra-clone variation, independent of core genome phylogeny with pan-genome analysis, suggesting a possible association and involvement of components of the type IV secretion system. However, GWAS and pan-GWAS analyses yielded weaker statistical significance. This study confirms GWAS and pan-GWAS trait associations can be performed for biofilm phenotype and produce data in agreement with each other. This panel of 280 study isolates, matched to genomic data has potential for the investigation of other phenotypes in P. aeruginosa perhaps as part of a growing database / collection. A representative, curated, genome sequenced collection should increase in usefulness as it grows offering increasing statistical power.\n\nImportanceP. aeruginosa is a major cause of multiply antibiotic infections worldwide but it is also found in many hospital and natural environments, especially aquatic ones. In this study we examined genetic polymorphism associated with biofilm production at room temperature and at body temperature, the biofilm associated gene repertoire of two major MDR clones and also genetic polymorphisms associated with biofilm production on stainless steel. Using these genome-wide and pan-genome wide association methods we identified / confirmed potential key genes involved in biofilm production and survival of P. aeruginosa. The study demonstrates the potential usefulness of large, genome sequenced isolate collections such as ours, to better understand the genetics underlying phenotypic diversity in this species.","Redfern, J.; Wallace, J.; Van Belkum, A.; Jaillard, M.; Whittard, E.; Ragupathy, R.; Verran, J.; Kelly, P.; Enright, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,82141,Assessment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria from respiratory samples in patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia,"IntroductionHospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is the one that presents clinically two or more days after admission into the hospital. Rapid identification of the causative agent of HAP will allow an earlier administration of a more appropriate antibiotic therapy and could lead to an improved outcome of patients with HAP.\n\nMethodsFirst of all, a rapid procedure (< 30 min) to extract the DNA from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endotracheal aspirate (EA) or bronchoaspirate (BAS) was set up. A loop-mediated isothermal amplification reaction (LAMP) specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Acinetobacter baumannii was carried out with the extracted solution. The reaction was performed at 65{o}C for 30-40 min. LAMP was compared with bacterial culture method.\n\nResultsOverall, 58 positive BAL and 83 EA/BAS samples were tested. The limits of detection varied according to the microorganism detected and to the respiratory sample analyzed. Validation of the LAMP assay with BAL samples showed that the assay was 100% specific and 86.3% sensitive (positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 50%). Meanwhile for BAS/EA samples, the assay rendered the following statistical parameters: 100% specificity, 94.6% sensitivity, 100% positive predictive value and 69.2% negative predictive value. These scores were obtained including minor errors as correct. The turnaround time including preparation of the sample and LAMP was circa 1 hour.\n\nConclusionsLAMP method may be used to detect the most frequent bacteria causing HAP. It is a simple, cheap, sensitive, specific and rapid assay.","Vergara, A.; Boutal, H.; Ceccato, A.; Lopez, M.; Cruells, A.; Bueno Freire, L.; Moreno, J.; Puig De La Bellacasa, J.; Castro, P.; Torres, A.; Marco, F.; Casals-Pascual, C.; Vila, J.",2019-07-26,Microbiology,10.1101/714709,1,Jordi  Vila,"Department of Microbiology, Hospital Clinic, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, CRESIB/IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714709v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714709v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/microorganisms8010103
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,82386,Epidemiological survey of serum titers from adults against various Gram-negative bacterial V-antigens,"The V-antigen, a virulence-associated protein, was first identified in Yersinia pestis more than half a century ago. Since then, other V-antigen homologs and orthologs have been discovered and are now considered vital molecules for the toxic effects mediated by the type III secretion system in infections caused by various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. After purifying recombinant V-antigen proteins including PcrV from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, LcrV from Yersinia, LssV from Photorhabdus luminescens, AcrV from Aeromonas salmonicida, and VcrV from Vibrio parahaemolyticus, we developed an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay to measure titers against each V-antigen in the sera collected from 186 adult volunteers. Different titer-specific correlation levels were determined for the five V-antigens. The anti-LcrV and anti-AcrV titers shared the highest correlation with each other, with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. The next highest correlation coefficient was between anti-AcrV and anti-VcrV titers at 0.79, while the lowest correlation was found between anti-LcrV and anti-VcrV titers, which were still higher than 0.7 Sera from mice immunized with one of the five recombinant V-antigens displayed cross-antigenicity with some of the other four V-antigens, supporting the results from the human sera. Thus, the serum anti-V-antigen titer measurement system could potentially be used for epidemiological investigations on various pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.","Kinoshita, M.; Shimizu, M.; Akiyama, K.; Kato, H.; Moriyama, K.; Sawa, T.",2019-07-29,Immunology,10.1101/718197,1,Teiji  Sawa,Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/718197v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/718197v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pone.0220924
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,83982,Design of Epitope Based Peptide Vaccine Against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Fructose Bisphosphate Aldolase Protein using Immunoinformatics,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common pathogen that is responsible of serious illnesses hospital acquired infection as ventilator associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndrome. Also it is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistant mechanisms. generally affects the immuonocompromised but can also infect the immunocompetent as in hot tub folliculitis. There is no vaccine against it available till now. This study predicts an effective epitope-based vaccine against Fructose bisphosphate aladolase (FBA) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using immunoinformatics tools. The sequences were obtained from NCBI and prediction tests took place to analyze possible epitopes for B and T cells. Three B cell epitopes passed the antigenicity, accessibility and hydrophilicity tests. Six MHC I epitopes were the most promising, while four from MHC II. Nineteen epitopes were shared between MHC I and II. For the population coverage, the epitopes covered 95.62% of the alleles worldwide excluding certain MHC II alleles. We recommend invivo and invitro studies to prove its effectiveness.","Elhag, M.; Mohamed Alaagib, R.; Mohamed Ahmed, N.; Abubaker Elhadi, M.; Musa Haroun, E.; Obi Abd Albagi, S.; A.hassan, M.",2019-08-12,Bioinformatics,10.1101/720730,1,Mustafa  Elhag,"Faculty of Medicine, University of Seychelles-American Institute of Medicine, Seychelles",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/720730v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/720730v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1155/2020/9475058
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,83848,Development and evaluation of a rapid on-site water pathogen detection system for water quality monitoring,"Timely response to outbreak of water-borne diseases caused by bacteria requires efficient monitoring and rapid detection strategies. Herein, we report a rapid DNA-based on-site detection system for specific detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To evaluate the test performance of our method against spiked water samples, parallel tests based on real-time PCR and standard culture methods were concurrently performed. Test sensitivities of between 96.7% and 92.3% were obtained, based on the calculation obtained from qPCR and culture test, respectively, with a corresponding level of specificity of 92.9% and 83.3%. Time-to-result is around 45 min, with a detection limit of 1 CFU/100 mL. Here, a fully-deployable detection method where bacteria of-interest can be detected rapidly with high accuracy was described. This test method can be modified to detect other bacteria of-interest and can also be used in different applications. The test results can be obtained on-site and can therefore be particularly useful in public facilities health surveillance, where regulators can quickly determine if a site is safe or if other emergency response measures are required.\n\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a well-established water quality biomarker, known to be associated to humans health risks. To ascertain the presence of this pathogen, relevant stakeholders currently rely on standard quantitative ISO methods (APHA 9213E) which require 6 days from sampling to results. This window could potentially lead to waterborne outbreaks if the contaminated water features are not shut down for proper and urgent mitigation. This manuscript describes a method to detect this disease-causing microorganism in its viable forms under 1 hour, with a sensitivity of 1 CFU/100mL. Besides providing valuable information of the quality of water system, this direct monitoring of pathogens can reduce substantial time needed from sampling to reporting. This method can be established as a platform technology for other pathogenic microorganisms. On-going work to develop economic point-of-care prototypes could facilitate quick screening of targeted waterborne pathogens and results in better assessment of public health risk and quick in devising emergency response measures and other management strategies.","Chia, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,84032,Discovery of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa Type VI secretion system toxin targeting bacterial protein synthesis using a global genomics approach,"The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a bacterial weapon which delivers toxic effectors to kill competitors or subvert some of their key functions. Here we use transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify T6SS toxins associated with the H1-T6SS, one of the three T6SS machines found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This approach identified several putative toxin-immunity pairs, including Tse8-Tsi8. Full characterization of this protein pair demonstrated that Tse8 is delivered by the VgrG1a spike complex into prey cells where it targets the transamidosome, a multiprotein complex involved in protein synthesis in bacteria lacking either one or both of the asparagine or glutamine tRNA synthases. Our data suggests that Tse8 combines as a non-cognate component of the transamidosome complex, reducing fitness by limiting the ability of the cell to synthesize proteins. This is the first demonstration of a T6SS toxin affecting protein synthesis, expanding the range of cellular components targeted by this bacterial weapon. The success of the current study validates the use of our TraDIS approach as a tool to drastically expand the repertoire of T6SS toxins in any T6SS-encoding bacterium.","Nolan, L. M.; Cain, A.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,84419,Therapeutically Exploring Persister Metabolism In Bacteria,"Bacterial persisters are rare phenotypic variants that are temporarily tolerant to high concentrations of antibiotics. We have previously discovered that persisters are mostly derived from stationary-phase cells with high redox activities that are maintained by endogenous protein and RNA degradation. This intracellular degradation resulted in self-inflicted damage that transiently repressed the cellular functions targeted by antibiotics. Leveraging this knowledge, we developed an assay integrating a degradable fluorescent protein system and a small library, containing FDA-approved drugs and antibiotics, to detect chemicals that target persister metabolism. We identified several metabolic inhibitors, including anti-psychotic drugs, that can reduce Escherichia coli persistence. These chemical inhibitors also reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa persistence, potentially verifying the existence of similar mechanisms in a medically relevant organism.","Mohiuddin, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,84414,Effects of Topical Antimicrobial Formulations on Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilm in an In vivo Porcine Burn Wound Model,"Silver has been incorporated into a variety of wound dressings and topical agents to prevent and combat wound infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of burn wound infections and well-known biofilm producer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a panel of wound dressings containing different silver formulations on P. aeruginosa biofilms using an in vivo porcine burn wound model. Second-degree burns were created on the skin of specific pathogen-free pigs (n = 3) and inoculated with 2.14 x 105 cfu P. aeruginosa per wound. Biofilms were allowed to develop for 24 h, and then each wound was treated with one of 6 treatments: silver oxynitrate dressing (OXY), silver oxynitrate powder (POWD), nanocrystalline silver dressing (NANO), silver chloride dressing (AGCL), silver sulfadiazine (SSD), or a negative control polyurethane film with no silver-based formulation (NEG). Wounds were cultured at D3 post-infection (n = 3 per pig per treatment) and at D6 post-infection (n = 3 per pig per treatment) for quantification of bacteria. On D6, biopsies (n = 3 per treatment) were taken from POWD, SSD, and NEG wounds and wound healing progress was evaluated histologically. At the time of treatment initiation, 24 h post-infection, 8.71 log cfu P. aeruginosa were present in burn wounds. On D3 and D6, all treatments significantly reduced bacterial counts in wounds as compared to NEG, but POWD caused an approximately 7-log reduction in bacterial counts on both days and was the only treatment to reduce the bacterial counts to below the threshold for detecting bacteria. The OXY, NANO, and SSD treatments had similar reductions in bacterial recovery on D3 and D6 of approximately 2.5-4 log. The histological healing metrics of reepithelialization percentage, epithelial thickness, white cell infiltration, angiogenesis, and granulation tissue formation were similar among wounds from POWD, SSD, and NEG groups at 6 days post-infection. Silver oxynitrate powder reduced P. aeruginosa growth in burn wounds more effectively than other silver-based dressings but did not impact wound healing.","Kalan, L.; Davis, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,85617,Photo sensing and quorum sensing are integrated to control bacterial collective behaviors.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa transitions between the free-swimming state and the sessile biofilm mode during its pathogenic lifestyle. We show that quorum sensing represses P. aeruginosa biofilm formation and virulence by activating expression of genes encoding the KinB-AlgB two-component system. Phospho-AlgB represses biofilm and virulence genes, while KinB dephosphorylates, and thereby, inactivates AlgB. We discover that the photoreceptor BphP is the kinase that, in response to light, phosphorylates and activates AlgB. Indeed, exposing P. aeruginosa to light represses biofilm formation and virulence gene expression. To our knowledge, P. aeruginosa was not previously known to detect light. The KinB-AlgB-BphP module is present in all Pseudomonads, and we demonstrate that AlgB is the cognate response regulator for BphP in diverse bacterial phyla. We propose that KinB-AlgB-BphP constitutes a \""three-component\"" system and AlgB is the node at which varied sensory information is integrated. This study sets the stage for light-mediated control of P. aeruginosa infectivity.","Mukherjee, S.; Jemielita, M.; Stergioula, V.; Tikhonov, M.; Bassler, B.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,85695,Exogenous alginate protects Staphylococcus aureus from killing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with both Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus have worse health outcomes than patients who are mono-infected with either P. aeruginosa or S. aureus. We showed previously that mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa can co-exist with S. aureus in vitro due to transcriptional downregulation of several toxic exoproducts typically produced by P. aeruginosa, including siderophores, rhamnolipids, and HQNO (2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide). Here we demonstrate that exogenous alginate protects S. aureus from P. aeruginosa in both planktonic and biofilm co-culture models under a variety of nutritional conditions. S. aureus protection in the presence of exogenous alginate is due to transcriptional downregulation of pvdA, a gene required for the production of the iron scavenging siderophore pyoverdine, as well as down-regulation of the PQS (Pseudomonas quinolone signal; 2-heptyl-3,4-dihydroxyquinoline) quorum sensing system. The impact of exogenous alginate is independent of endogenous alginate production. We further demonstrate that co-culture of mucoid P. aeruginosa with non-mucoid P. aeruginosa can mitigate the killing of S. aureus by the non-mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa, indicating that the mechanism we describe here may function in vivo in the context of mixed infections. Finally, we investigated a panel of mucoid clinical isolates that retain the ability kill S. aureus at late time points, and show that each strain has a unique expression profile, indicating that mucoid isolates can overcome the effects of mucoidy in a strain-specific manner.\n\nIMPORTANCECF patients are chronically infected by polymicrobial communities of microorganisms. The two dominant bacterial pathogens that infect CF patient lungs are P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, with [~]30% of patients co-infected by both species. Patients infected with both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus have worse outcomes than mono-infected patients, and both species persist within the same physical space in the lungs of CF patients. A variety of host and environmental factors have been demonstrated to promote P. aeruginosa-S. aureus co-existence, despite evidence that P. aeruginosa kills S. aureus when these organisms are co-cultured in vitro. Thus, a better understanding of P. aeruginosa-S. aureus interactions, particularly mechanisms by which these microorganisms are able to co-exist in proximal physical space, will lead to better informed treatments for chronic polymicrobial infections.","Price, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,86218,"Non-hierarchical, RhlR-regulated acyl-homoserine lactone quorum sensing in a cystic fibrosis isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa","The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. P. aeruginosa employs several hierarchically arranged and interconnected quorum sensing (QS) regulatory circuits to produce a battery of virulence factors such as elastase, phenazines, and rhamnolipids. The QS transcription factor LasR sits atop this hierarchy, and activates the transcription of dozens of genes, including that encoding the QS regulator RhlR. Paradoxically, inactivating lasR mutations are frequently observed in isolates from CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infections. In contrast, mutations in rhlR are rare. We have recently shown that in CF isolates, the QS circuitry is often \""rewired\"" such that RhlR acts in a LasR-independent manner. To begin understanding how QS activity differs in this \""rewired\"" background, we characterized QS activation and RhlR-regulated gene expression in P. aeruginosa E90, a LasR-null, RhlR-active chronic infection isolate. In this isolate, RhlR activates the expression of 53 genes in response to increasing cell density. The genes regulated by RhlR include several that encode virulence factors. Some, but not all, of these genes are present in the QS regulon described in the well-studied laboratory strain PAO1. We also demonstrate that E90 produces virulence factors at similar concentrations to that of PAO1. Unlike PAO1, cytotoxicity by E90 in a three-dimensional lung epithelium cell model is also RhlR-regulated. These data illuminate a \""rewired\"" LasR-independent RhlR regulon in chronic infection isolates and suggest that RhlR may be a target for therapeutic development in chronic infections.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPseudomonas aeruginosa is a prominent cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen that uses quorum sensing (QS) to regulate virulence. In laboratory strains, the key QS regulator is LasR. Some isolates from patients with chronic CF infections appear to use an alternate QS circuitry in which another transcriptional regulator, RhlR, mediates QS. We show that a LasR-null CF clinical isolate engages in QS through RhlR and remains capable of inducing cell death in an in vivo-like lung epithelium cell model. Our findings support the notion that LasR-null clinical isolates can engage in RhlR QS and highlight the centrality of RhlR gene regulation in chronic P. aeruginosa infections.","Cruz, R.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,86640,Uncovering the dynamic mechanisms of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa quorum sensing and virulence networks using Boolean modelling,"IntroductionPseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen with an extraordinary metabolic adaptability and a large repertoire of virulence factors that allow it to cause acute and chronic infections. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections often fail due to its antibiotic resistance mechanisms, thus novel strategies aim at targeting virulence factors instead of growth-related features. However, there is currently not a clear understanding of the dynamic nature inherent to the wiring of its virulence networks.\n\nResultsIn this study, we manually reconstructed the signalling and transcriptional regulatory networks of 12 acute (incl. pyocin and elastase) and 8 chronic virulence factors (incl. biofilm), and the 4 quorum sensing (QS) systems of P. aeruginosa. Using Boolean modelling (BM), we unveiled the important roles that stochasticity and node connectivity play in the networks inherent dynamicity and robustness. We showed that both the static interactions, as well as the time when the interactions take place, are important features in the QS network. In addition, we found that the virulence factors of the acute networks are under strict repression, or under an activation that is non-strict or oscillatory, while the chronic networks favour the repression of the virulence factor, with only moderate activation under certain conditions.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, our in silico-modelling framework provided us with a system-level view of the P. aeruginosa virulence and QS networks to gain new insights into the various mechanisms that support its pathogenicity and response to stressors targeting these networks. Thus, we suggest that BM provides an invaluable tool to guide the design of new treatments against P. aeruginosa.","Banzhaf, M.; Resendis Antonio, O.; Zepeda Mendoza, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,86719,Parallel evolution of tobramycin resistance across species and environments,"An important problem in evolution is identifying the genetic basis of how different species adapt to similar environments. Understanding how various bacterial pathogens evolve in response to antimicrobial treatment is a pressing example of this problem, where discovery of molecular parallelism could lead to clinically useful predictions. Evolution experiments with pathogens in environments containing antibiotics combined with periodic whole population genome sequencing can be used to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of the pathways to antimicrobial resistance. We separately propagated two clinically relevant Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, in increasing concentrations of tobramycin in two different environments each: planktonic and biofilm. Independent of the pathogen, populations adapted to tobramycin selection by parallel evolution of mutations in fusA1, encoding elongation factor G, and ptsP, encoding phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase. As neither gene is a direct target of this aminoglycoside, both are relatively novel and underreported causes of resistance. Additionally, both species acquired antibiotic-associated mutations that were more prevalent in the biofilm lifestyle than planktonic, in electron transport chain components in A. baumannii and LPS biosynthesis enzymes in P. aeruginosa populations. Using existing databases, we discovered both fusA1 and ptsP mutations to be prevalent in antibiotic resistant clinical isolates. Additionally, we report site-specific parallelism of fusA1 mutations that extend across several bacterial phyla. This study suggests that strong selective pressures such as antibiotic treatment may result in high levels of predictability in molecular targets of evolution despite differences between organisms genetic background and environment.","Scribner, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,86729,Interdependency of respiratory metabolism and phenazine-associated physiology in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14,"Extracellular electron transfer (EET), the reduction of compounds that shuttle electrons to distal oxidants, can support bacterial survival when preferred oxidants are not directly accessible. EET has been shown to contribute to virulence in some pathogenic organisms and is required for current generation in mediator-based fuel cells. In several species, components of the electron transport chain (ETC) have been implicated in electron shuttle reduction, raising the question of how shuttling-based metabolism is integrated with primary routes of metabolic electron flow. The clinically relevant bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa can utilize carbon sources (i.e., electron donors) covering a broad range of reducing potentials and possesses a branched ETC that can be modulated to optimize respiratory efficiency. It also produces electron shuttles called phenazines that facilitate intracellular redox balancing, increasing the complexity of its metabolic potential. In this study, we investigated the reciprocal influence of respiratory metabolism and phenazine-associated physiology in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. We found that phenazine production affects respiratory activity and terminal oxidase gene expression, and that carbon source identity influences the mechanisms enabling phenazine reduction. Furthermore, we found that growth in biofilms, a condition for which phenazine metabolism is critical to normal development and redox balancing, dramatically affects the composition of the P. aeruginosa phenazine pool. Together, these findings can aid interpretation of P. aeruginosa behavior during host infection and provide inroads to understanding the crosstalk between primary metabolism and shuttling-based physiology in the diverse bacteria that carry out EET.\n\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections and long-term lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. It can use diverse organic compounds as electron donors and possesses multiple enzymes that can transfer electrons from central metabolism to O2. These pathways support a balanced intracellular redox state and the production of cellular energy. Under hypoxic conditions, P. aeruginosa can reduce phenazines, secondary metabolites that also promote redox homeostasis and that contribute to virulence. We asked how these primary and secondary routes of electron flow influence each other. We found that phenazines affect respiratory function, that the roles of respiratory enzymes in phenazine reduction are highly condition-dependent, and that the complement of phenazines produced is strongly affected by growth in assemblages called biofilms. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of P. aeruginosa redox metabolism and may inform strategies for treating persistent infections caused by this bacterium.","Jo, J.; Price-Whelan, A.; Cornell, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,87154,The structure of the iron-catecholate transporter Fiu suggests substrate import occurs via a 2-step mechanism,"The Ferric Iron Uptake (Fiu) transporter from Escherichia coli functions in the transport of iron-catecholate complexes across the bacterial outer membrane, providing the bacterium with iron which is an essential element for growth. Recently, it became clear that Fiu also represents a liability: its activity allows the import of antimicrobial compounds that have evolved to mimic catecholate. In this work we have determined the structure of Fiu and analyzed its function to address how Fiu and related transporters from other bacterial species can bind catecholate in a surface-exposed cavity. In addition, the crystal structure of Fiu reveals the presence of a large, selectively gated cavity in the interior of this transporter. This chamber is large enough to accommodate the Fiu substrate and may act to regulate substrate import. These data provide insight into the mechanism of substrate uptake by Fiu and related transporters identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. As Fiu and its homologues are the targets of substrate mimicking antibiotics, these data will assist in the development of antibiotics that target these receptors for cell entry.","Grinter, R.; Lithgow, T.",2019-09-09,Biochemistry,10.1101/763268,1,Rhys  Grinter,Monash University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/763268v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/763268v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1074/jbc.RA119.011018
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,87328,Genomic interrogation of the burden and transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens within and across hospital networks,"BackgroundMultidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) disproportionately affect hospitalized patients due to the combination of comorbidities, frequent antimicrobial use, and in-hospital MDRO transmission. Identification of MDRO transmission by hospital microbiology laboratories is difficult due to limitations of existing typing methods.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective multicenter genomics implementation study (8 hospitals, 2800 beds) from 24th April to 18th June 2017 in Melbourne, Australia. Clinical and screening isolates from hospital inpatients were collected for six MDROs (vanA VRE, MRSA, ESBL E. coli [ESBL-Ec] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [ESBL-Kp], and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [CRPa] and Acinetobacter baumannii [CRAb]), sequenced (Illumina NextSeq) and analyzed using open-source tools. MDRO transmission was assessed by genomics (core SNP phylogeny, grouped by species and ST) and compared to epidemiologic data.\n\nResults408 isolates were collected from 358 patients; 47.5% were screening isolates. ESBL-Ec was most common (52.5%), then MRSA (21.6%), vanA VRE (15.7%) and ESBL-Kp (7.6%).\n\nWe define the transmission rate for each MDRO by genomics and epidemiology; 31.6% of all study patients had potential genomic links to other study isolates; 86% of these were confirmed by epidemiologic links (probable or possible transmission). The highest transmission rates occurred with vanA VRE (88.4% of patients).\n\nConclusionsCombining genomics with high-quality epidemiologic data gives substantial insights into the burden and distribution of critical MDROs in hospitals, including in-hospital transmission. By defining transmission rates by genomics, we hope to enable comparisons over time and between sites, and introduce this as a new outcome measure to assess the efficacy of infection control interventions.","Sherry, N.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,87368,Static growth alters PrrF- and 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone regulation of virulence trait expression in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that is frequently associated with both acute and chronic infections, the latter of which are often polymicrobial. P. aeruginosa possesses a complex regulatory network that modulates nutrient acquisition and virulence, but our knowledge of these networks is largely based on studies with shaking cultures, which are not likely representative of conditions during infection. Here, we provide proteomic, metabolic, and genetic evidence that regulation by iron, a critical metallo-nutrient, is altered in static P. aeruginosa cultures. We identified type VI secretion as a target of iron regulation in P. aeruginosa in static but not shaking conditions, and we present evidence that this regulation occurs via PrrF sRNA-dependent production of 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone metabolites. We further discovered that iron-regulated interactions between P. aeruginosa and a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus, are mediated by distinct factors in shaking versus static bacterial cultures. These results yield new bacterial iron regulation paradigms and highlight the need to re-define iron homeostasis in static microbial communities.","Brewer, L. K.; Huang, W.; Hackert, B.; Kane, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,87535,Systemic Infection Facilitates Transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Health care-associated infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) bacteremia pose a major clinical risk for hospitalized patients, and efforts to limit them are a priority. The fitness pressures accounting for PA virulence factors that facilitate bloodstream infections are unclear, as these infections are presumed to be a \""dead-end\"" and have no impact on transmission. Here, we used a mouse model to show that PA spreads from the bloodstream to the gallbladder, where it replicates to extremely high numbers. Bacteria in the gallbladder then seed the intestines and feces, leading to transmission to uninfected cage-mate mice. The findings demonstrate that the gallbladder is critical for spread of PA from the bloodstream to the feces during bacteremia, a process that promotes transmission.","Bachta, K. E. R.; Allen, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,88106,Discovery and characterization of a Gram-positive Pel polysaccharide biosynthetic gene cluster,"Our understanding of the biofilm matrix components utilized by Gram-positive bacteria, and the signalling pathways that regulate their production are largely unknown. In a companion study, we developed a computational pipeline for the unbiased identification of homologous bacterial operons and applied this algorithm to the analysis of synthase-dependent exopolysaccharide biosynthetic systems (https://doi.org/10.1101/769745). Here, we explore the finding that many species of Gram-positive bacteria have operons with similarity to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa pel locus. Our characterization of the pelDEADAFG operon from Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, presented herein, demonstrates that this locus is required for biofilm formation and produces a polysaccharide structurally similar to Pel. We show that the degenerate GGDEF domain of the B. cereus PelD ortholog binds cyclic-3,5-dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP), and that this binding is required for biofilm formation. Finally, we identify a diguanylate cyclase, CdgF, and a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, CdgE, that reciprocally regulate the production of Pel. The discovery of this novel c-di-GMP regulatory circuit significantly contributes to our limited understanding of c-di-GMP signalling in Gram-positive organisms. Furthermore, conservation of the core pelDEADAFG locus amongst many species of Bacilli, Clostridia, Streptococci, and Actinobacteria suggests that Pel may be a common biofilm matrix component in many Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Pel polysaccharide is required for biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa and we have previously found that the genes necessary for biosynthesis of this polymer are broadly distributed across Gram-negative bacteria. Herein, we show that many species of Gram-positive bacteria also possess Pel biosynthetic genes and demonstrate that these genes are used Bacillus cereus for biofilm formation. We show that Pel production in B. cereus is regulated by c-di-GMP and have identified two enzymes, a diguanylate cyclase, CdgF, and a phosphodiesterase, CdgE, that control the levels of this bacterial signalling molecule. While Pel production in B. cereus also requires the binding of c-di-GMP to the receptor PelD, the divergence of this protein in Streptococci suggests a c-di-GMP independent mechanism of regulation is used in this species. The discovery of a Pel biosynthetic gene cluster in Gram-positive bacteria and our characterization of the pel operon in B. cereus suggests that Pel is a widespread biofilm component across all bacteria.","Whitfield, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,87730,Whole genome sequence analysis reveals broad distribution of the RtxA type 1 secretion system and four novel type 1 secretion systems throughout the Legionella genus,"Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are broadly distributed among bacteria and translocate effectors with diverse function across the bacterial cell membrane. Legionella pneumophila, the species most commonly associated with Legionellosis, encodes a T1SS at the lssXYZABD locus which is responsible for the secretion of the virulence factor RtxA. Many investigations have failed to detect lssD, the gene encoding the membrane fusion protein of the RtxA T1SS, in non-pneumophila Legionella, suggesting that this system is a conserved virulence factor in L. pneumophila. Here we discovered RtxA and its associated T1SS in a novel Legionella taurinensis strain, leading us to question whether this system may be more widespread than previously thought. Through a bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data, we classified and determined the distribution of four T1SSs including the RtxA T1SS and four novel T1SSs among diverse Legionella spp. The ABC transporter of the novel Legionella T1SS Legonella repeat protein secretion system (LRPSS) shares structural similarity to those of diverse T1SS families, including the alkaline protease T1SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The Legionella bacteriocin (1-3) secretion systems (LB1SS-LB3SS) T1SSs are novel putative bacteriocin transporting T1SSs as their ABC transporters include C-39 peptidase domains in their N-terminal regions, with LB2SS and LB3SS likely constituting a nitrile hydratase leader peptide transport T1SSs. The LB1SS is more closely related to the colicin V T1SS in Escherichia coli. Of 45 Legionella spp. whole genomes examined, 19 (42%) were determined to possess lssB and lssD homologs. Of these 19, only 7 (37%) are known pathogens. There was no difference in the proportions of disease associated and non-disease associated species that possessed the RtxA T1SS (p = 0.4), contrary to the current consensus regarding the RtxA T1SS. These results draw into question the nature of RtxA and its T1SS as a genetic virulence determinant.","Brown, C. L.; Garner, E.; Jospin, G.; Coil, D. A.; Schwake, D. O.; Eisen, J.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,88495,Surface association induces cytotoxic alkyl-quinolones in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Surface attachment, an early step in the colonization of multiple host environments, activates the virulence of the human pathogen P. aeruginosa. However, the signaling pathways and downstream toxins specifically induced by surface association to stimulate P. aeruginosa virulence are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that alkyl-quinolone (AQ) secondary metabolites are rapidly induced upon surface association and represent a major class of surface-dependent cytotoxins. AQ cytotoxicity is direct and independent of other AQ functions like quorum sensing or PQS-specific activities like iron sequestration. Furthermore, the regulation of AQ production can explain the surface-dependent virulence regulation of the quorum sensing receptor, LasR, and the pilin-associated candidate mechanosensor, PilY1. PilY1 regulates surface-induced AQ production by repressing the AlgR-AlgZ two-component system. AQs also contribute to the known cytotoxicity of secreted outer membrane vesicles. These findings collectively explain previously mysterious aspects of virulence regulation and provide new avenues for the development of anti-infectives.","Vrla, G.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,88919,Substrate recognition by the Pseudomonas aeruginosa EF-Tu methyltransferase EftM,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen and a leading cause of serious infections in individuals with cystic fibrosis, compromised immune systems, and severe burns. During infection, P. aeruginosa adhesion to host epithelial cells is enhanced by surface exposed translation elongation factor EF-Tu carrying a Lys5 trimethylation. This modification is incorporated by the S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase EftM. Thus, EF-Tu modification by EftM may represent a novel target to restrict the establishment of P. aeruginosa infections in vulnerable individuals. Here, we extend our understanding of EftM action by defining the molecular mechanism of EF-Tu substrate recognition by this enzyme. First, following the observation that EftM can bind to EF-Tu lacking an N-terminal peptide (encompassing the Lys5 target site), an EftM homology model was generated and used in protein-protein docking studies to predict EftM:EF-Tu interactions. The predicted protein-protein interface was then experimentally validated using site-directed mutagenesis of residues in both proteins coupled with binding and methyltransferase activity assays. We also show that EftM is unable to methylate the isolated N-terminal EF-Tu peptide and that binding-induced conformational changes in EftM are likely needed to allow placement of the first 5-6 amino acids of EF-Tu into the conserved peptide binding channel. In this channel, a group of residues that are highly conserved in EftM family proteins position the N-terminal sequence to facilitate modification of Lys5. Our findings provide detailed insights into substrate recognition by this lysine methyltransferase, paving the way for a deeper understanding of EftMs mechanism of action on EF-Tu.","Kuiper, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,88548,Forging new antibiotic combinations under iron-limiting conditions,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen. We showed previously that thiostrepton (TS), a gram-positive thiopeptide antibiotic, was imported via pyoverdine receptors and synergized with iron chelator deferasirox (DSX) to inhibit the growth of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. A small number of P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates were resistant to the combination, prompting us to search for other compounds that could synergize with TS against those strains. From literature surveys we selected 14 compounds reported to have iron-chelating activity, plus one iron analogue, and tested them for synergy with TS. Doxycycline (DOXY), ciclopirox olamine (CO), tropolone (TRO), clioquinol (CLI), and gallium nitrate (GN) synergized with TS. Individual compounds were bacteriostatic but the combinations were bactericidal. Our spectrophotometric data and chrome azurol S agar assay confirmed that the chelators potentate TS activity through iron sequestration rather than through their innate antimicrobial activities. A triple combination of TS + DSX + DOXY had the most potent activity against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. One P. aeruginosa clinical isolate was resistant to the triple combination, but susceptible to a triple combination containing higher concentrations of CLI, CO, or DOXY. All A. baumannii isolates were susceptible to the triple combinations. Our data reveal a diverse set of compounds with dual activity as antibacterial agents and TS adjuvants, allowing combinations to be tailored for resistant clinical isolates.","Chan, D. C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,88431,"Coexistence with Pseudomonas aeruginosa alters Staphylococcus aureus transcriptome, antibiotic resistance and internalization into epithelial cells","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening genetic disease among Caucasians. CF patients suffer from chronic lung infections due to the presence of thick mucus, caused by cftr gene dysfunction. The two most commonly found bacteria in the mucus of CF patients are Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is well known that early-infecting P. aeruginosa strains produce anti-staphylococcal compounds and inhibit S. aureus growth. More recently, it has been shown that late-infecting P. aeruginosa strains develop commensal-like/coexistence interaction with S. aureus. The aim of this study was to decipher the impact of P. aeruginosa strains on S. aureus. RNA sequencing analysis showed 77 genes were specifically dysregulated in the context of competition and 140 genes in the context of coexistence in the presence of P. aeruginosa. In coexistence, genes encoding virulence factors and proteins involved in carbohydrates, lipids, nucleotides and amino acids metabolism were downregulated. On the contrary, several transporter family encoding genes were upregulated. In particular, several antibiotic pumps belonging to the Nor family were upregulated: tet38, norA and norC, leading to an increase in antibiotic resistance of S. aureus when exposed to tetracycline and ciprofloxacin and an enhanced internalization rate within epithelial pulmonary cells. This study shows that coexistence with P. aeruginosa affects the S. aureus transcriptome and virulence.","Briaud, P.; Camus, L.; Bastien, S.; Doleans-Jordheim, A.; Vandenesch, F.; Moreau, K.",2019-09-19,Microbiology,10.1101/775684,1,Karen  Moreau,"CIRI, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie, Inserm U1111, Universite Lyon1, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, CNRS UMR5308, Lyon, France.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/775684v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/775684v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s41598-019-52975-z
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,89444,Pseudomonas aeruginosa leucine aminopeptidase influences early biofilm composition and structure via vesicle-associated anti-biofilm activity,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, known as one of the leading causes of disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, secretes a variety of proteases. These enzymes contribute significantly to P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and biofilm formation in the chronic colonization of CF patient lungs, as well as playing a role in infections of the cornea, burn wounds and chronic wounds. We previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is highly expressed during infection and in biofilms, and it associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known to contribute to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. We hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background alters biofilm microcolony composition to increase cellular density, while decreasing matrix polysaccharide content, and that OMVs from PaAP expressing strains but not PaAP alone or in combination with PaAP deletion strain-derived OMVs could complement this phenotype. We additionally found that OMVs from PaAP expressing strains could cause protease-mediated biofilm detachment, leading to changes in matrix and colony composition. Finally, we showed that the OMVs could also mediate the detachment of biofilms formed by both non-self P. aeruginosa strains and Klebsiella pneumoniae, another respiratory pathogen. Our findings represent novel roles for OMVs and the aminopeptidase in the modulation of P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture.\n\nImportanceBiofilm formation by the bacterial pathogen P. aeruginosa is known to contribute to drug- resistance in nosocomial infections and chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients. In order to treat these infections more successfully, the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm development must be elucidated. While both bacterially-secreted aminopeptidase and outer membrane vesicles have been shown to be abundant in P. aeruginosa biofilm matrices, the contributions of each of these factors to the steps in biofilm generation have not been well studied. This work provides new insight as to how these bacterial components mediate the formation of a robust, drug-resistant extracellular matrix and implicates outer membrane vesicles as active components of biofilm architecture, expanding our overall understanding of P. aeruginosa biofilm biology.","Esoda, C.; Kuehn, M.",2019-09-27,Microbiology,10.1101/784918,1,Meta  Kuehn,Duke University Medical Center,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/784918v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/784918v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1128/mbio.02548-19
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,89951,Availability of Zinc Impacts Interactions Between Streptococcus sanguinis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Co-culture,"Airway infections associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) are polymicrobial. We reported previously that clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa promote the growth of a variety of streptococcal species. To explore the mechanistic basis of this interaction, we performed a genetic screen to identify mutants of Streptococcus sanginuis SK36 whose growth was no longer enhanced by P. aeruginosa PAO1. Mutations in zinc uptake systems of S. sanginuis SK36 reduced growth of these strains by 1-3 log compared to wild-type S. sanginuis SK36 when grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa PA01, while exogenous zinc (0.1-10 m) rescued the coculture defect of zinc uptake mutants of S. sanginuis SK36. Zinc uptake mutants of S. sanginuis SK36 had no obvious growth defect in monoculture. Consistent with a competition for zinc driving coculture dynamics, S. sanginuis SK36 grown in coculture with P. aeruginosa showed increased expression of zinc uptake genes compared to S. sanginuis grown alone. Strains of P. aeruginosa PAO1 defective in zinc transport also supported more robust growth by S. sanginuis compared to coculture with wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1. An analysis of 118 CF sputum samples revealed that total zinc levels varied from ~5-145 M. At relatively low zinc levels, Pseudomonas and Streptococcus were found in approximately equal abundance; at higher zinc levels, we observed an increasing relative abundance of Pseudomonas and decline of Streptococcus, perhaps as a result of increasing zinc toxicity. Together, our data indicate that the relative abundance of these microbes in the CF airway may be impacted by zinc levels.\n\nIMPORTANCEPolymicrobial infections in CF likely impact patient health, but the mechanism(s) underlying such interactions are poorly understood. Here we show that interactions between Pseudomonas and Streptococcus are modulated by zinc availability using an in vitro model system, and clinical data are consistent with this model. Together with previous studies, our work supports a role for metal homeostasis as a key factor driving microbial interactions.","Li, K.; Gifford, A. H.; Hampton, T.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,91322,Epidemiology of bacterial contamination of inert hospital surfaces and equipment in critical and non-critical care units: a Brazilian multicenter study,"The hospital environment is an important reservoir of microorganisms, including multidrug-resistant pathogens, which can cause in-patient contamination and healthcare-related infections. The objective of this study was to analyze the epidemiology of bacterial contamination (contaminated sites, pathogen species and their antimicrobial susceptibility, and tracking of multidrug-resistant microorganisms - MDR) of inert hospital surfaces and medical equipment in two public hospitals in Northern Brazil. This was a cross-sectional study with 243 samples (n = 208, from Hospital A; and n = 35, from Hospital B) collected by friction with swabs moistened in Brain Heart Infusion from inert surfaces and equipment. The samples were cultivated and bacterial species were identified by the classical approach and tested for their susceptibility through agar diffusion assay according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Most inert surfaces and equipment analyzed presented bacterial contamination (95.5%). Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen of clinical significance detected both in Hospital A (61.8%) and B (68.6%). Hospital A showed higher rates of isolated MDR bacteria than Hospital B, especially in the Adult Intensive Care Unit, which included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (52.7%), Enterobacteria resistant to 4th generation cephalosporins (19.4%), and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2.78%). The failures in the prevention and control of infections in the two hospitals analyzed reinforce the need for a revised protocol for cleaning and disinfection of inert surfaces and medical equipment, and for regulation of antibiotic dispensing, mainly in the AICU of Hospital A, which was found to be a reservoir of MDR pathogens. This study is innovative because it is the pioneer in Western Bahia that describes the epidemiology of contamination of hospital surfaces, opportuning futures studies in this field.","Rodrigues, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,90874,Light-mediated decreases in cyclic di-GMP levels are potentiated by pyocyanin and inhibit structure formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms,"Light is known to trigger regulatory responses in diverse organisms including slime molds, animals, plants, and phototrophic bacteria. However, light-dependent processes in non-phototrophic bacteria, and those of pathogens in particular, have received comparatively little research attention. In this study, we examined the impact of light on multicellular development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a leading cause of biofilm-based bacterial infections, using a colony morphology assay. In this assay, P. aeruginosa strain PA14 grown in the dark forms vertical structures (i.e., \""wrinkles\"") on the third day of incubation. We found that growth in blue light inhibited wrinkle formation until the fifth day and that this required the phenazine pyocyanin, a redox-active metabolite produced by PA14. Light-dependent inhibition of wrinkling was also correlated with low levels of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP), consistent with the role of this signal in stimulating biofilm matrix production. Though phenazine-null biofilms also showed lower levels of c-di-GMP and subtle effects on wrinkling when grown in the light, their overall levels of c-di-GMP were higher than those of the wild type. This indicates that phenazines and light simultaneously promote c-di-GMP degradation such that c-di-GMP is pushed to a minimum level, yielding a pronounced macroscopic phenotype. A screen of enzymes with the potential to catalyze c-di-GMP synthesis or degradation identified four proteins that contribute to light-dependent inhibition of biofilm wrinkling. Together, these results provide a foundation for understanding the significance of light-dependent regulation in P. aeruginosa.\n\nImportanceThe response to light in non-phototrophic bacteria (i.e., chemotrophs) is relatively understudied in comparison to light-mediated behavior in eukaryotes and phototrophic bacteria. Though they do not depend on light for growth, chemotrophic bacteria could benefit from sensing this cue when it correlates with other parameters that are important for metabolism. In this paper, we describe light-dependent effects on a cellular signal that controls the development of multicellular assemblages, called biofilms, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We found that light at intensities that are not harmful to human cells inhibited biofilm maturation. P. aeruginosa is a leading cause of chronic lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis and of hospital-acquired infections. As P. aeruginosas recalcitrance to treatment is attributed in part to its facile formation of biofilms, this study provides insight into a mechanism that could be inhibited via new therapeutic tools, such as photodynamic therapy.","Kahl, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,91245,The Intrinsically Disordered Region of ExbD is Required for Signal Transduction,"The TonB system actively transports vital nutrients across the unenergized outer membranes of the majority of Gram-negative bacteria. In this system, integral membrane proteins ExbB, ExbD, and TonB work together to transduce the protonmotive force (PMF) of the inner membrane to customized active transporters in the outer membrane by direct and cyclic binding of TonB to the transporters. A PMF-dependent TonB-ExbD interaction is prevented by 10-residue deletions within a periplasmic disordered domain of ExbD adjacent to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we explored the function of the ExbD disordered domain in more detail. In vivo photo-cross-linking through sequential pBpa substitutions in the ExbD disordered domain captured five different ExbD complexes, some of which had been previously detected using in vivo formaldehyde crosslinking, a technique that lacks the residue-specific information that can be achieved through photo-cross-linking: 2 ExbB-ExbD heterodimers (one of which had not been detected previously), previously detected ExbD homodimers, previously detected PMF-dependent ExbD-TonB heterodimers, and for the first time, a predicted, ExbD-TonB PMF-independent interaction. The fact that multiple complexes were captured by the same pBpa substitution indicated the dynamic nature of ExbD interactions as the energy transduction cycle proceeded in vivo. In this study, we also discovered that a conserved motif, (V45, V47, L49, P50), within the disordered domain was required for signal transduction to TonB and to the C-terminal domain of ExbD and was the source of its essentiality.\n\nImportanceThe TonB system is a virulence factor for many Gram-negative pathogens including E-S-K-A-P-E pathogenic species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because the majority of protein-protein interactions in the TonB system occur in the periplasm, it is an appealing target for novel antibiotics. Understanding the molecular mechanism of the TonB system will provide valuable information for design of potential inhibitors targeting the system.","Kopp, D.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,91035,Phenotypic differences in reversible attachment behavior reveal distinct P. aeruginosa surface colonization strategies,"Despite possessing the machinery to sense, adhere to, and proliferate on surfaces, it is commonly observed that bacteria initially have a difficult time attaching to a surface. Before forming a bacterial biofilm, planktonic bacteria exhibit a random period of transient surface attachment known as \""reversible attachment\"" which is poorly understood. Using community tracking methods at single-cell resolution, we examine how reversible attachment progresses during initial stages of surface sensing. Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PA14, which exhibit similar exponential trends of surface cell population increase, show unanticipated differences when the behavior of each cell was considered at the full lineage level and interpreted using the unifying quantitative framework of an exactly solvable stochastic model. Reversible attachment comprises two regimes of behavior, processive and nonprocessive, corresponding to whether cells of the lineage stay on the surface long enough to divide, or not, before detaching. Stark differences between PAO1 and PA14 in the processive regime of reversible attachment suggest the existence of two complementary surface colonization strategies, which are roughly analogous to \""immediate-\"" vs \""deferred-gratification\"" in a prototypical cognitive-affective processing system. PAO1 lineages commit relatively quickly to a surface compared to PA14 lineages. PA14 lineages allow detaching cells to retain memory of the surface so that they are primed for improved subsequent surface attachment. In fact, it is possible to identify motility suppression events in PA14 lineages in the process of surface commitment. We hypothesize that these contrasting strategies are rooted in downstream differences between Wsp-based and Pil-Chp-based surface sensing systems.","Lee, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,91416,Pseudomonas aeruginosa lasR mutant fitness in microoxia is supported by an Anr-regulated oxygen-binding hemerythrin,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains with loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor are frequently encountered in the clinic and the environment. Among the characteristics common to LasR-defective (LasR-) strains is increased activity of the transcription factor Anr, relative to their LasR+ counterparts, in low oxygen conditions. One of the Anr-regulated genes that was highly induced in the LasR-strains encoded a putative oxygen-binding hemerythrin encoded by PA14_42860 (PA1673) which we named mhr for microoxic hemerythrin. Purified P. aeruginosa Mhr protein contained the predicted di-iron center and binds oxygen with a Kd of 1 {micro}M. Both Anr and Mhr were necessary for fitness in lasR+ and lasR mutant strains in colony biofilms grown in microoxic conditions, and the effects were more striking in the lasR mutant. Among genes in the Anr regulon, mhr was most closely co-regulated with the Anr-controlled high affinity cytochrome c oxidase genes and in the absence of high affinity cytochrome c oxidase activity, deletion of mhr no longer caused a fitness disadvantage suggesting that Mhr works in concert with microoxic respiration. We demonstrate that Anr and Mhr contribute to LasR-strain fitness even in the normoxic biofilm conditions, and metabolomics data indicate that in a lasR mutant, expression of Anr-regulated mhr leads to differences in metabolism in cells grown on LB and artificial sputum medium. Together these data indicate that increased Anr activity in microoxically-grown lasR mutants confers an advantage in part for its regulation of the O2 binding protein Mhr.\n\nSignificancePseudomonas aeruginosa, a versatile bacterium that both lives in environmental habitats and causes life-threatening opportunistic infections, uses quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression with cell density. The lasR gene, which encodes a quorum sensing regulator, is often deleteriously mutated in clinical isolates. Interestingly, LasR-strains have high activity of the oxygen-sensitive transcription factor Anr in microoxic conditions. This report identifies and characterizes an Anr-regulated microoxic hemerythrin that reversibly binds oxygen. We showed both anr and mhr are critical to fitness in microoxia, and these genes uniquely benefit LasR-strains in normoxia. Our findings enrich our understanding of the success of P. aeruginosa as a pulmonary resident through its propensity to lose LasR functionality in the context of low-oxygen infection environments.","Clay, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,91926,See and Sequence: Integrating Whole-Genome Sequencing Within the National Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program in the Philippines,"Drug-resistant bacterial infections constitute a growing threat to public health globally 1. National networks of laboratory-based surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitor the emergence and spread of resistance and are central to the dissemination of these data to AMR stakeholders 2. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can support these efforts by pinpointing resistance mechanisms and uncovering transmission patterns 3, 4. However, genomic surveillance is rare in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which are predicted to be the most affected by AMR 5. We implemented WGS within the established Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program (ARSP) of the Philippines via ongoing technology transfer, capacity building in and binational collaboration. In parallel, we conducted an initial large-scale retrospective sequencing survey to characterize bacterial populations and dissect resistance phenotypes of key bug-drug combinations, which is the focus of this article. Starting in 2010, the ARSP phenotypic data indicated increasing carbapenem resistance rates for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. We first identified that this coincided with a marked expansion of specific resistance phenotypes. By then linking the resistance phenotypes to genomic data, we revealed the diversity of genetic lineages (strains), AMR mechanisms, and AMR vehicles underlying this expansion. We discovered a previously unreported plasmid-driven hospital outbreak of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, uncovered the interplay of carbapenem resistance genes and plasmids in the geographic circulation of epidemic K. pneumoniae ST147, and found that carbapenem-resistant E. coli ST410 consisted of diverse lineages of global circulation that carried both international and local plasmids, resulting in a combination of carbapenemase genes variants previously unreported for this organism. Thus, the WGS data provided an enhanced understanding of the interplay between strains, genes and vehicles driving the dissemination of carbapenem resistance in the Philippines. In addition, our retrospective survey served both as the genetic background to contextualize local prospective surveillance, and as a comprehensive dataset for training in bioinformatics and genomic epidemiology. Continued prospective sequencing, capacity building and collaboration will strengthen genomic surveillance of AMR in the Philippines and the translation of genomic data into public-health action. We generated a blueprint for the integration of WGS and genomic epidemiology into an established national system of laboratory-based surveillance of AMR through international collaboration that can be adapted and utilized within other locations to tackle the global challenge of AMR.","Argimon, S.; Masim, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,92005,Hypermutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits multiple genetic pathways to develop multidrug resistance during long term infections in the airways of cystic fibrosis patients,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa exploits intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to resist almost every antibiotic used in chemotherapy. Antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is further enhanced by the occurrence of hypermutator strains, a hallmark of chronic CF infections. However, the within-patient genetic diversity of P. aeruginosa populations related to antibiotic resistance remains unexplored. Here, we show the evolution of the mutational resistome profile of a P. aeruginosa hypermutator lineage by performing longitudinal and transversal analyses of isolates collected from a CF patient throughout 20 years of chronic infection. Our results show the accumulation of thousands of mutations with an overall evolutionary history characterized by purifying selection. However, mutations in antibiotic resistance genes appear to be positively selected, driven by antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic resistance increased as infection progressed towards the establishment of a population constituted by genotypically diversified coexisting sub-lineages, all of which converged to multi-drug resistance. These sub-lineages emerged by parallel evolution through distinct evolutionary pathways, which affected genes of the same functional categories. Interestingly, ampC and fstI, encoding the {beta}-lactamase and penicillin-binding protein 3, respectively, were found among the most frequently mutated genes. In fact, both genes were targeted by multiple independent mutational events, which led to a wide diversity of coexisting alleles underlying {beta}-lactam resistance. Our findings indicate that hypermutators, apart from boosting antibiotic resistance evolution by simultaneously targeting several genes, favor the emergence of adaptive innovative alleles by clustering beneficial/compensatory mutations in the same gene, hence expanding P. aeruginosa strategies for persistence.\n\nIMPORTANCEBy increasing mutation rates, hypermutators boost antibiotic resistance evolution by enabling bacterial pathogens to fully exploit their genetic potential and achieve resistance mechanisms for almost every known antimicrobial agent. Here, we show how co-existing clones from a P. aeruginosa hypermutator lineage that evolved during 20 years of chronic infection and antibiotic chemotherapy, converged to multidrug resistance by targeting genes from alternative genetic pathways that are part of the broad P. aeruginosa resistome. Within this complex assembly of combinatorial genetic changes, in some specific cases, multiple mutations are needed in the same gene to reach a fine tuned resistance phenotype. Hypermutability enables this genetic edition towards higher resistance profiles by recurrently targeting these genes, thus promoting new epistatic relationships and the emergence of innovative resistance-conferring alleles. Our findings help to understand this link between hypermutability and antibiotic resistance, a key challenge for the design of new therapeutic strategies.","Colque, C.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,92587,Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Staphylococcus aureus from cystic fibrosis lung infections and their interactions with Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria that infect the respiratory tract of individuals with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF); in fact, S. aureus has recently overtaken P. aeruginosa to become the most common. Substantial research has been performed on the epidemiology of S. aureus in CF; however, there appears to be a gap in knowledge in regard to the pathogenesis of S. aureus in the context of CF lung infections. Most studies have focused on a few S. aureus isolates, often exclusively laboratory adapted strains, and how they are killed by P. aeruginosa. Because of this, little is known about the diversity of S. aureus CF lung isolates in both virulence and interaction with P. aeruginosa. To begin to address this gap in knowledge, we recently sequenced 65 clinical S. aureus isolates from the Emory CF Biospecimen Registry and Boston Childrens Hospital, including the reference isolate JE2, a USA300 strain. Here, we analyzed antibiotic resistance genotypes, sequence type, clonal complex, spa type, and agr type of these isolates. We hypothesized that major virulence phenotypes of S. aureus that may be associated with CF lung infections, namely toxin production and mucoid phenotype, would be retained in these isolates. To test our hypothesis, we plated on specific agars and found that most isolates can hemolyze both rabbit and sheep blood (67.7%) and produce polysaccharide (69.2%), consistent with virulence retention in CF lung isolates. We also identified three distinct phenotypic groups of S. aureus based on their survival in the presence of nonmucoid P. aeruginosa laboratory strain PAO1 and its mucoid derivative. Altogether, our work provides greater insight into the diversity of S. aureus CF isolates, specifically the distribution of important virulence factors and their interaction with P. aeruginosa, all of which have implications in patient health.\n\nAuthor SummaryStaphylococcus aureus is now the most frequently detected pathogen in the lungs of individuals who have cystic fibrosis (CF), followed closely by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. When these two pathogens are found to coinfect the CF lung, patients have a significantly worse prognosis. While P. aeruginosa has been rigorously studied in the context of bacterial pathogenesis in CF, less is known about S. aureus. Here we present an in-depth study of 64 S. aureus CF clinical isolates where we investigated genetic diversity utilizing whole genome sequencing, virulence phenotypes, and interactions with P. aeruginosa. We have found that S. aureus isolated from the CF lung are phylogenetically diverse, most retain known virulence factors, and they vary in interactions with P. aeruginosa from highly sensitive to completely tolerant. Deepening our understanding of how S. aureus responds to its environment and other microbes in the CF lung will enable future development of effective treatments and preventative measures against these formidable infections.","Bernardy, E.

Despite the efforts spent so far, the current antibiotics in the market are restricted to only five general targets/pathways highlighting the need for basic research focusing on the discovery and evaluation of new potential targets. Here we interrogate two biosynthetic pathways as potentially druggable pathways in bacteria. The biosynthesis pathway for thiamine (vitamin B1), absent in humans, but found in many bacteria, including organisms in the group of the ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) and the biosynthesis pathway for pyridoxal 5-phosphate and its vitamers (vitamin B6), found in S. aureus.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,92924,Antagonistic activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens against multidrug resistant Serratia rubidaea,"Serratia rubidaea a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, known to survive harsh environmental conditions and responsible for hospital associated infections. Specifically, S. rubidaea can withstand desiccation and survive on hospital surfaces and equipments as well as have acquired antimicrobial resistance determinants for different commercial antibiotics. The expansion of this multidrug resistant pattern suggests that the treatment of S. rubidaea infections will become increasingly difficult in near future. Although some measures were taken to control this species, an inhibition mechanism is remaining unknown. To design effective means to control the dissemination of S. rubidaea, an in-depth analysis is required. In the present study, one possible candidate was isolated from the soil of Sundarban Mangroove Forest (Bangladesh) that has important physiological effects to inhibit this pathogenic bacterium. The bacterial isolate was initially identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens using BIOLOG identification system and confirmed to be B. amyloliquefaciens strain through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The growth and antagonistic activity of this potential strain was shown to be stable under wide range of pH, temperature and salinity (NaCl). Moreover, the novel B. amyloliquefaciens isolate can also inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria. These results suggest that B. amyloliquefaciens might have potential antimicrobial properties and further research is required for future use of this bacterium as biological controls of S. rubidaea or development as new drugs for pathogenic bacteria.","Bhuiyan, M.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,93784,"ChpC controls twitching motility-mediated expansion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in response to serum albumin, mucin and oligopeptides","Twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion occurs via coordinated, multi-cellular collective behaviour to allow bacteria to actively expand across surfaces. Type-IV pili (T4P) are cell-associated virulence factors which mediate this expansion via rounds of extension, surface attachment and retraction. The Chp chemosensory system is thought to respond to environmental signals to regulate the biogenesis, assembly and twitching motility function of T4P. In other well characterised chemosensory systems, methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) feed environmental signals through a CheW adapter protein to the histidine kinase CheA to modulate motility. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa Chp system has two CheW adapter proteins, PilI and ChpC, and an MCP PilJ that likely interacts via PilI with the histidine kinase ChpA. It is thought that ChpC associates with other MCPs to feed environmental signals into the system, however no such signals have been identified. In the current study we show that ChpC is involved in the response to host-derived signals serum albumin, mucin and oligopeptides. We demonstrate that these signals stimulate an increase in twitching motility, as well as in levels of 3-5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and surface-assembled T4P. Interestingly, our data shows that changes in cAMP and surface piliation levels are independent of ChpC but that the twitching motility response to these environmental signals requires ChpC. Based upon our data we propose a model whereby ChpC associates with an MCP other than PilJ to feed these environmental signals through the Chp system to control twitching motility. The MCP PilJ and the CheW adapter PilI then modulate T4P surface levels to allow the cell to continue to undergo twitching motility. Our study is the first to link environmental signals to the Chp chemosensory system and refines our understanding of how this system controls twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion in P. aeruginosa.","Nolan, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,94263,Contextual flexibility in Pseudomonas aeruginosa central carbon metabolism during growth in single carbon sources,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, particularly noted for causing infections in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies have shown that the gene expression profile of P. aeruginosa appears to converge towards a common metabolic program as the organism adapts to the CF airway environment. However, at a systems level, we still have only a limited understanding of how these transcriptional changes impact on metabolic flux. To address this, we analysed the transcriptome, proteome and fluxome of P. aeruginosa grown on glycerol or acetate. These carbon sources were chosen because they are the primary breakdown products of airway surfactant, phosphatidylcholine, which is known to be a major carbon source for P. aeruginosa in the CF airways. We show that the flux of carbon through central metabolism is radically different on each carbon source. For example, the newly-recognised EDEMP cycle plays an important role in supplying NADPH during growth on glycerol. By contrast, the EDEMP cycle is attenuated during growth on acetate, and instead, NADPH is primarily supplied by the isocitrate dehydrogenase(s)-catalyzed reaction. Perhaps more importantly, our proteomic and transcriptomic analyses reveal a global remodelling of gene expression during growth on the different carbon sources, with unanticipated impacts on aerobic denitrification, electron transport chain architecture, and the redox economy of the cell. Collectively, these data highlight the remarkable metabolic plasticity of P. aeruginosa; a plasticity which allows the organism to seamlessly segue between different carbon sources, maximising the energetic yield from each.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen, well-known for causing infections in the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. Although it is clear that P. aeruginosa is metabolically well-adapted to life in the CF lung, little is currently known about how the organism metabolises the nutrients available in the airways. In this work, we use a combination of gene expression and isotope tracer (\""fluxomic\"") analyses to find out exactly where the input carbon goes during growth on two CF-relevant carbon sources, acetate and glycerol (derived from the breakdown of lung surfactant). We find that carbon is routed (\""fluxed\"") through very different pathways during growth on these substrates, and that this is accompanied by an unexpected remodelling of the cells electron transfer pathways. Having access to this \""blueprint\"" is important because the metabolism of P. aeruginosa is increasingly being recognised as a target for the development of much-needed antimicrobial agents.","Dolan, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,94354,Immediate activation of chemosensory neuron gene expression by bacterial metabolites is selectively induced by distinct cyclic GMP-dependent pathways in C. elegans,"Dynamic gene expression in neurons shapes fundamental processes of the nervous systems of animals. But how different stimuli that activate the same neuron can lead to distinct transcriptional responses remains unclear. We have been studying how microbial metabolites modulate gene expression in chemosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. Considering the diverse environmental stimuli that can activate chemosensory neurons of C. elegans, we have sought to understand how specific transcriptional responses can be generated in these neurons in response to distinct cues. We have focused on the mechanism of rapid (<6 min) and selective transcriptional induction of daf-7, a gene encoding a TGF-{beta} ligand that promotes bacterial lawn avoidance, in the ASJ chemosensory neurons in response to the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we define the involvement of two distinct cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent pathways that are required for daf-7 expression in the ASJ neuron pair in response to P. aeruginosa. We show that a calcium-independent pathway dependent on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) EGL-4, and a canonical calcium-dependent signaling pathway dependent on the activity of a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit CNG-2, function in parallel to activate rapid, selective transcription of daf-7 in response to P. aeruginosa metabolites. Our data suggest a requirement for PKG in promoting the fast, selective early transcription of neuronal genes in shaping responses to distinct microbial stimuli in a pair of chemosensory neurons of C. elegans.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe nervous systems of animals carry out the crucial roles of sensing and interpreting the external environment. When the free-living microscopic roundworm C. elegans is exposed to the pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, sensory neurons detect metabolites produced by the pathogen and induce expression of the gene for a neuroendocrine ligand called DAF-7. In turn, activity of DAF-7 is required for the full avoidance response to the P. aeruginosa, allowing the animals to reduce bacterial load and survive longer. Here, we systematically dissect the molecular pathway between the sensation of P. aeruginosa metabolites and the expression of daf-7 in a pair of C. elegans sensory neurons. We show that the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic GMP is a key signaling intermediate. In addition, we show that there are calcium-dependent and calcium-independent pathways that are both required to engage daf-7 expression, highlighting an organizational principle that allows neurons to distinguish between various stimuli.","Park, J.; Meisel, J.

The crystallographic structure of Ttg2D at 2.5[A] resolution reveals that this protein can bind two diacyl phospholipids. Native and denaturing mass spectrometry experiments confirm that Ttg2D binds two phospholipid molecules, which may have different head groups. Analysis of the available structures of Ttg2D orthologs allowed us to classify this protein family as a novel substrate-binding protein fold and to venture the evolutionary events that differentiated the orthologs binding one or two phospholipids. In addition, gene knockout experiments in P. aeruginosa PAO1 and multidrug-resistant strains show that disruption of this system leads to outer membrane permeabilization. This demonstrates the role of this system in low-level intrinsic resistance against certain antibiotics that use a lipid-mediated pathway to permeate through membranes.","Yero, D.; Costenaro, L.; Conchillo-Sole, O.; Diaz-Lobo, M.; Mayo, A.; Ferrer-Navarro, M.; Vilaseca, M.; Gibert, I.; Daura, X.",2019-11-08,Microbiology,10.1101/834812,1,Xavier  Daura,Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA),https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/834812v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/834812v1.full.pdf,0,NA

In a previous study, it was suggested that endophytic bacteria, which naturally inhabit the internal tissues of plants, can also be transmitted from the parasitic weed to its host and vice versa.

In the current study, we investigate the characteristics of a previously isolated Pseudomonas sp. PhelS10 strain, using both biochemical and molecular methods. Our results revealed that production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa quinolone signal (PQS) was 2.1 times higher than that of the standard Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (PAO1), which contributed to a 22% higher biofilm formation capability. PhelS10 strain was detected in the xylem of tomato plants using FISH analysis. In addition, PhelS10 strain was found in the parasitic weeds inner tissues, confirming the hypothesis that endophytic bacteria traffic between the plant host and its parasitic weed.","Iasur Kruh, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,95658,"Global reprogramming of virulence and antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by a single nucleotide polymorphism in the elongation factor-encoding gene, fusA1.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common opportunistic pathogen. The organism displays elevated intrinsic antibiotic resistance and can cause life-threatening infections. The gene encoding an elongation factor, FusA1, is frequently mutated in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Recent work has shown that fusA1 mutants often display elevated aminoglycoside resistance due to increased expression of the aminoglycoside efflux pump, MexXY. In the current work, we isolated a spontaneous gentamicin-resistant fusA1 mutant (FusA1P443L) in which mexXY expression was increased. Through a combination of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses, we found that the fusA1 mutant also exhibited large-scale but discrete changes in the expression of key pathogenicity-associated genes. Most notably, the fusA1 mutant displayed greatly increased expression of the Type III Secretion system (T3SS), widely considered to be the most potent virulence factor in the P. aeruginosa arsenal, and also elevated expression of the Type VI Secretion (T6S) machinery. This was unexpected because expression of the T3SS is usually reciprocally coordinated with T6S system expression. The fusA1 mutant also displayed elevated exopolysaccharide production, dysregulated siderophore production, elevated ribosomal protein synthesis, and transcriptomic signatures indicative of translational stress. Each of these phenotypes (and almost all of the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with the fusA1 mutation) were restored to levels comparable to that in the PAO1-derived progenitor strain by expression of the wild-type fusA1 gene in trans, indicating that the mutant gene is recessive. Our data show that in addition to elevating antibiotic resistance through mexXY expression (although we also identify additional contributory resistance mechanisms), mutations in fusA1 can lead to highly-selective dysregulation of virulence gene expression.","Maunders, E.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,96324,Pseudomonas aeruginosa core metabolism exerts a widespread growth-independent control on virulence,"Bacterial virulence may rely on secondary metabolism, but core metabolism genes are assumed to be necessary primarily for bacterial growth. To assess this assumption, we correlated the genome, the transcriptome and the pathogenicity of 30 fully sequenced Pseudomonas strains using two Drosophila and one mouse infection assay. In accordance with previous studies gene presence-absence does not explain differences in virulence among P. aeruginosa strains, but merely between P. aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species. Similarly, classical gene expression analysis of highly vs. lowly pathogenic P. aeruginosa strains identifies many virulence factors, and only a few metabolism genes related to virulence. Nevertheless, assessing the virulence of 553 core metabolic and 95 random non-metabolic gene mutants of P. aeruginosa PA14, we found 16.5% of the core metabolic and 8.5% of the non-metabolic genes to be necessary for full virulence. Strikingly, 11.8% of the core metabolism genes exhibit defects in virulence that cannot be attributed to auxotrophy. The compromised in virulence metabolic gene mutants were mapped in multiple pathways and exhibited further defects in acute virulence phenotypes and in a mouse lung infection model. Functional transcriptomics re-analysis of core metabolism at the pathway level, reveals amino-acid, succinate, citramalate, and chorismate biosynthesis and beta-oxidation as important for full virulence and expression of these pathways indicative of virulence in various strains. Thus, P. aeruginosa virulence variation, which to this point remains unpredictably combinatorial at the gene level, can be dissected at the pathway level via combinatorial trancriptome and functional core metabolism analysis.","Panayidou, S.; Georgiades, K.; Christofi, T.; Tamana, S.; Promponas, V.; Apidianakis, Y.",2019-11-20,Microbiology,10.1101/850206,1,Yiorgos  Apidianakis,UCY,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/850206v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/850206v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1038/s41598-020-66194-4
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,96450,Bacterial quorum sensing allows graded and bimodal cellular responses to variations in population density,"Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism of cell-cell communication that connects gene expression to environmental conditions (e.g. density) in many bacterial species, mediated by diffusible signal molecules. Current functional studies focus on a dichotomy of QS on/off (or, quorate / sub-quorate) states, overlooking the potential for intermediate, graded responses to shifts in the environment. Here, we track QS regulated protease (lasB) expression and show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can deliver a graded behavioral response to fine-scale variation in population density, on both the population and single-cell scales. On the population scale, we see a graded response to variation in environmental population density. On the single-cell scale, we see significant bimodality at higher densities, with separate OFF and ON sub-populations that respond differentially to changes in density; static OFF cells and increasing intensity of expression among ON cells. Together these results indicate that QS can tune gene expression to graded environmental change, with no critical cell mass or  quorum at which behavioral responses are activated on either the individual cell or population scale. In an infection context, our results indicate there is not a hard threshold separating sub-quorate  stealth mode and a quorate  attack mode.","Rattray, J. B.; Thomas, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,96444,"Extracellular DNA controls expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa genes involved in nutrient utilization, metal homeostasis, acid pH tolerance, and virulence.","Pseudomonas aeruginosa grows in extracellular DNA-enriched biofilms and infection sites. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) is generally considered a structural biofilm polymer required for aggregation and biofilm maturation. In addition, eDNA can sequester divalent metal cations, acidify the growth media, and serve as a nutrient source. Here we determine the transcriptome of planktonic P. aeruginosa grown in the presence of eDNA using RNA-seq. Transcriptome analysis identified 89 induced genes and 76 repressed genes in the presence of eDNA (FDR<0.05), and transcriptional lux fusions were used to confirm eDNA regulation. A large number of eDNA-induced genes appear to be involved in utilizing DNA as a nutrient. Several eDNA-induced genes are also induced by acidic pH 5.5, and growth in the presence of eDNA or acidic pH promoted an acid tolerance response in P. aeruginosa. The cyoABCDE terminal oxidase is induced at pH 5.5 and contributed to the acid tolerance phenotype. Quantitative metal analysis confirmed that DNA binds to diverse metals, which helps explain why many genes involved in a general uptake of metals were controlled by eDNA. Growth in the presence of eDNA also promoted intracellular bacterial survival and influenced virulence and during the acute infection model of fruit flies. The diverse functions of the eDNA-regulated genes underscore the important role of this extracellular polymer in promoting antibiotic resistance, virulence, acid tolerance, and nutrient utilization; phenotypes that contribute to long-term survival.","Lewenza, S.; Johnson, L.; Charron-Mazenod, L.; Hong, M.; Mulcahy-O'grady, H.",2019-11-21,Microbiology,10.1101/850446,1,Shawn  Lewenza,Athabasca University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/850446v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/850446v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1099/jmm.0.001184
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,97082,Pyocin S5 import into Pseudomonas aeruginosa reveals a generic mode of bacteriocin transport,"Pyocin S5 (PyoS5) is a potent protein bacteriocin that eradicates the human pathogen P. aeruginosa in animal infection models, but its import mechanism is poorly understood. Here, using crystallography, biophysical and biochemical analysis and live-cell imaging, we define the entry process of PyoS5 and reveal links to the transport mechanisms of other bacteriocins. In addition to its C-terminal pore-forming domain, elongated PyoS5 comprises two novel tandemly repeated kinked three helix bundle domains that structure-based alignments identify as key import domains in other pyocins. The central domain binds the lipid-bound common polysaccharide antigen, allowing the pyocin to accumulate on the cell surface. The N-terminal domain binds the ferric pyochelin transporter FptA while its associated disordered region binds the inner membrane protein TonB1, which together drive import of the bacteriocin across the outer membrane. Finally, we identify the minimal requirements for sensitizing Escherichia coli towards PyoS5, as well as other pyocins, and suggest that a generic pathway likely underpins the import of all TonB-dependent bacteriocins across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.","Behrens, H.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,97295,Building a better biofilm - formation of in vivo-like biofilm structures by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a porcine model of cystic fibrosis lung infection,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung are highly resistant to current antimicrobial treatments and are associated with increased mortality rates. The existing models for such infections are not able to reliably mimic the clinical biofilms observed. We aimed to further optimise an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for P. aeruginosa CF lung infection that can be used to increase understanding of chronic CF biofilm infection. The EVPL model will facilitate discovery of novel infection prevention methods and treatments, and enhanced exploration of biofilm architecture. We investigated purine metabolism and biofilm formation in the model using transposon insertion mutants in P. aeruginosa PA14 for key genes: purD, gacA and pelA. Our results demonstrate that EVPL recapitulates a key aspect of in vivo P. aeruginosa infection metabolism, and that the pathogen forms a biofilm with a clinically realistic structure not seen in other in vitro studies. Two pathways known to be required for in vivo biofilm infection - the Gac regulatory pathway and production of the Pel exopolysaccharide - are essential to the formation of this mature, structured biofilm on EVPL tissue. We propose the high-throughput EVPL model as a validated biofilm platform to bridge the gap between in vitro and CF lung infection.","Harrington, N.

It is a key process that facilitates the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and virulence determinants throughout bacterial populations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen that produces large quantities of extracellular DNA (eDNA) that is required for biofilm formation. P. aeruginosa has a remarkable level of genome plasticity and diversity that suggests a high degree of horizontal gene transfer and recombination but is thought to be incapable of natural transformation. Here we show that P. aeruginosa possesses homologs of all proteins known to be involved in natural transformation in other bacterial species. We found that P. aeruginosa in biofilms is competent for natural transformation of both genomic and plasmid DNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that type IV pili (T4P) facilitate but are not absolutely essential for natural transformation in P. aeruginosa.","Nolan, L. M.; Turnbull, L.; Katrib, M.; Osvath, S.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,97744,A minimal CRISPR-Cas3 system for genome engineering,"CRISPR-Cas technologies have provided programmable gene editing tools that have revolutionized research. The leading CRISPR-Cas9 and Cas12a enzymes are ideal for programmed genetic manipulation, however, they are limited for genome-scale interventions. Here, we utilized a Cas3-based system featuring a processive nuclease, expressed endogenously or heterologously, for genome engineering purposes. Using an optimized and minimal CRISPR-Cas3 system (Type I-C) programmed with a single crRNA, large deletions ranging from 7 - 424 kb were generated in Pseudomonas aeruginosa with high efficiency and speed. By comparison, Cas9 yielded small deletions and point mutations. Cas3-generated deletion boundaries were variable in the absence of a homology-directed repair (HDR) template, and successfully and efficiently specified when present. The minimal Cas3 system is also portable; large deletions were induced with high efficiency in Pseudomonas syringae and Escherichia coli using an ""all-in-one"" vector. Notably, Cas3 generated bi-directional deletions originating from the programmed cut site, which was exploited to iteratively reduce a P. aeruginosa genome by 837 kb (13.5%) using 10 distinct crRNAs. We also demonstrate the utility of endogenous Cas3 systems (Type I-C and I-F) and develop an ""anti-anti-CRISPR"" strategy to circumvent endogenous CRISPR-Cas inhibitor proteins. CRISPR-Cas3 could facilitate rapid strain manipulation for synthetic biological and metabolic engineering purposes, genome minimization, and the analysis of large regions of unknown function.","Csorgo, B.; Leon, L.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,98058,Combining antibiotics with antivirulence compounds can have synergistic effects and reverse selection for antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Antibiotics are losing efficacy due to the rapid evolution and spread of resistance. Treatments targeting bacterial virulence factors have been considered as alternatives because they target virulence instead of pathogen viability, and should therefore exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, antivirulence treatments rarely clear infections, which compromises their clinical applications. Here, we explore the potential of combining antivirulence drugs with antibiotics against the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We combined two antivirulence compounds (gallium, a siderophore-quencher, and furanone C-30, a quorum sensing-inhibitor) together with four clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tobramycin) in 9x9 drug concentration matrices. We found that drug-interaction patterns were concentration dependent, with promising levels of synergies occurring at intermediate drug concentrations for certain drug pairs. We then tested whether antivirulence compounds are potent adjuvants, especially when treating antibiotic resistant clones. We found that the addition of antivirulence compounds to antibiotics could restore growth inhibition for most antibiotic resistant clones, and even abrogate or reverse selection for resistance in five drug combination cases. Molecular analyses suggest that selection against resistant clones occurs when resistance mechanisms involve restoration of protein synthesis, but not when efflux pumps are upregulated. Altogether, our work provides a first systematic analysis of antivirulence-antibiotic combinatorial treatments and suggests that such combinations have a high potential to be both effective in treating infections and in limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.","Rezzoagli, C.; Archetti, M.; Mignot, I.; Baumgartner, M.; Kuemmerli, R.",2020-05-04,Microbiology,10.1101/861799,2,Rolf  Kuemmerli,University of Zurich,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/861799v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/861799v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1371/journal.pbio.3000805
Pseudomonas aeruginosa,97828,Bacteriophages inhibit biofilms formed by multi-drug resistant bacteria isolated from septic wounds,"Globally, indiscriminate use of antibiotics contributed to the development of antibiotic resistance by the majority of microbial pathogens. As an alternative to antibiotics, using bacteriophages as antibiofilm agents to tackle multi-drug resistant bacteria has gained importance in recent years. In the present study, we explored the ability of bacteriophages to inhibit biofilm formation under various conditions. Under dynamic condition (DR), wherein the medium is a renewal for every 12 h amount of biomass produced (0.74 {+/-} 0.039), log10 CFU count (6.3 {+/-} 0.55) was highest when compared to other physical conditions tested.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,97852,Decay and damage of therapeutic phage OMKO1 by environmental stressors,"Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are increasingly prevalent, driving the need for alternative approaches to chemical antibiotics when treating infections. One such approach is bacteriophage therapy: the use of bacteria-specific viruses that lyse (kill) their host cells. Just as the effect of environmental conditions (e.g. elevated temperature) on antibiotic efficacy is well-studied, the effect of environmental stressors on the potency of phage therapy candidates demands examination. Therapeutic phage OMKO1 infects and kills the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, we used phage OMKO1 as a model to test how different environments affect the decay rate of a therapeutic virus, and whether exposure to an environmental stressor can damage surviving viral particles. We assessed the effects of elevated temperatures, saline concentrations, and urea concentrations. We observed that OMKO1 particles were highly tolerant to different saline concentrations, but decayed more rapidly at elevated temperatures and under high concentrations of urea. Additionally, we found that exposure to elevated temperature reduced the ability of surviving phage particles to suppress the growth of P. aeruginosa, suggesting a temperature-induced damage. Our findings demonstrate that OMKO1 is highly tolerant to a range of conditions that could be experienced inside and outside the human body, while also showing the need for careful characterization of therapeutic phages to ensure that environmental exposure does not compromise their expected potency, dosing, and pharmacokinetics.","Blazanin, M.; Lam, W.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa,98050,The effect of flow on swimming bacteria controls the initial colonization of curved surfaces,"The colonization of solid surfaces by bacteria is a widespread phenomenon with major consequences on environmental processes, biotechnology and human health. While much is known about the molecular mechanisms of surface colonization, the influence of the physical environment remains poorly understood. Here we show that the magnitude and location of colonization of non-planar surfaces by motile bacteria is largely controlled by the local flow conditions. Using microfluidic experiments with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that the velocity gradients created by a curved surface drive preferential attachment to specific regions of the collecting surface, namely the leeward side of cylinders and immediately downstream of apexes on corrugated surfaces, locations that are in stark contrast to where non-motile cells attach. The preferential attachment location depends on the local hydrodynamic conditions and, as revealed by a mathematical model benchmarked on the observations, on cell morphology and swimming traits, while it is independent of the physicochemical properties of the surface. The interplay between imposed flow and bacterial motility further affects the overall attachment rate, increasing it by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the non-motile case at moderate flow velocities of up to twenty times the bacterial swimming speed. These results highlight the importance of fluid flow on the magnitude and location of bacterial colonization of surfaces and provide a mechanistic model to predict colonization in flow for a wide range of applications, from infection biology to bioremediation and biofouling.","Secchi, E.; Vitale, A.; Mino, G.

Bacteriophage therapy has seen near constant use in eastern Europe since its discovery over a century ago. One promising approach is to use phages that not only reduce bacterial pathogen loads, but also select for phage resistance mechanisms that trade-off with antibiotic resistance - so called  phage steering. Recent work has shown that phage OMKO1 can interact with efflux pumps and in so doing select for both phage resistance and antibiotic sensitivity. We tested the robustness of this approach to three different antibiotics in vitro and one in vivo. We show that in vitro OMKO1 can reduce antibiotic resistance either in the absence or the presence of antibiotics. Our in vivo experiment showed that phage increased the survival times of wax moth larvae and increased bacterial sensitivity to erythromycin, both in the absence and presence of the antibiotic. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on this promising therapeutic approach using OMKO1.","Gurney, J.; Pradier, L.; Griffin, J. S.; Gougat-Barbera, C.; Chan, B.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,257,Modelling and analysis of bacterial tracks suggest an active reorientation mechanism in Rhodobacter sphaeroides,"Most free-swimming bacteria move in approximately straight lines, interspersed with random reorientation phases. A key open question concerns varying mechanisms by which reorientation occurs. We combine mathematical modelling with analysis of a large tracking dataset to study the poorly-understood reorientation mechanism in the monoflagellate species Rhodobacter sphaeroides. The flagellum on this species rotates counterclockwise to propel the bacterium, periodically ceasing rotation to enable reorientation. When rotation restarts the cell body usually points in a new direction. It has been assumed that the new direction is simply the result of Brownian rotation. We consider three variants of a self-propelled particle model of bacterial motility. The first considers rotational diffusion only, corresponding to a non-chemotactic mutant strain. A further two models also include stochastic reorientations, describing  run-and-tumble motility. We derive expressions for key summary statistics and simulate each model using a stochastic computational algorithm. We also discuss the effect of cell geometry on rotational diffusion. Working with a previously published tracking dataset, we compare predictions of the models with data on individual stopping events in R. sphaeroides.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,302,Automated ensemble assembly and validation of microbial genomes,"BackgroundThe continued democratization of DNA sequencing has sparked a new wave of development of genome assembly and assembly validation methods. As individual research labs, rather than centralized centers, begin to sequence the majority of new genomes, it is important to establish best practices for genome assembly. However, recent evaluations such as GAGE and the Assemblathon have concluded that there is no single best approach to genome assembly. Instead, it is preferable to generate multiple assemblies and validate them to determine which is most useful for the desired analysis; this is a labor-intensive process that is often impossible or unfeasible.\n\nResultsTo encourage best practices supported by the community, we present iMetAMOS, an automated ensemble assembly pipeline; iMetAMOS encapsulates the process of running, validating, and selecting a single assembly from multiple assemblies. iMetAMOS packages several leading open-source tools into a single binary that automates parameter selection and execution of multiple assemblers, scores the resulting assemblies based on multiple validation metrics, and annotates the assemblies for genes and contaminants. We demonstrate the utility of the ensemble process on 225 previously unassembled Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as well as a Rhodobacter sphaeroides benchmark dataset.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,105136,Light-driven ATP production promotes mRNA biosynthesis inside hybrid multi-compartment artificial protocells,"The construction of energetically autonomous artificial protocells is one of the most urgent and challenging requirements in bottom-up synthetic biology. Here we show a hybrid multi-compartment approach to build Artificial Simplified-Autotroph Protocells (ASAPs) in an effective manner. Chromatophores obtained from Rhodobacter sphaeroides accomplish the photophosphorylation of ADP to ATP functioning as nanosized photosynthetic organellae when encapsulated inside artificial giant phospholipid vesicles. Under continuous illumination chromatophores produce ATP that in turn sustains the transcription of a DNA gene by T7 RNA polymerase inside ASAPs. Cryo-EM and time-resolved spectroscopy were used for characterizing the chromatophore morphology and the orientation of the photophosphorylation proteins, which allow high ATP production rates (up to ~100 ATP/s per ATP synthase). mRNA biosynthesis inside individual vesicles has been determined by confocal microscopy. The hybrid multi-compartment approach here proposed appears at the same time convenient and effective, and thus very promising for the construction of full-fledged artificial protocells.","Altamura, E.; Albanese, P.; Marotta, R.; Milano, F.; Fiore, M.; Trotta, M.; Stano, P.; Mavelli, F.",2020-02-05,Synthetic Biology,10.1101/2020.02.05.933846,1,Fabio  Mavelli,"Department of Chemistry, University of Bari 'Aldo Moro', Bari, Italy",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.933846v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.933846v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA
Rhodobacter sphaeroides,170558,High efficiency excitation energy transfer in biohybrid quantum dot-bacterial reaction center nanoconjugates,"Reaction centers (RCs) are the pivotal component of natural photosystems, converting solar energy into the potential difference between separated electrons and holes that is used to power much of biology. RCs from anoxygenic purple photosynthetic bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides only weakly absorb much of the visible region of the solar spectrum which limits their overall light-harvesting capacity. For in vitro applications such as bio-hybrid photodevices this deficiency can be addressed by effectively coupling RCs with synthetic lightharvesting materials. Here, we studied the time scale and efficiency of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a nanoconjugate assembled from a synthetic quantum dot (QD) antenna and a tailored RC engineered to be fluorescent. Time-correlated single photon counting spectroscopy of biohybrid conjugates enabled the direct determination of FRET from QDs to attached RCs on a time scale of 26.6 {+/-} 0.1 ns and with a high efficiency of 0.75 {+/-} 0.01.","Amoruso, G.; Liu, J.; Polak, D.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,179239,A Novel Membrane Protein in the Rhodobacter sphaeroides LH1-RC Photocomplex,"We present a cryo-EM structure of the monomeric light-harvesting-reaction center (LH1-RC) core complex from photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides at 2.9 [A] resolution. The LH1 complex forms a C-shaped structure composed of 14 {beta}-polypeptides around the RC with a large ring opening. From the cryo-EM density map, a previously unrecognized integral membrane protein, referred to as protein-U, was identified. Protein-U has a U-shaped conformation near the LH1-ring opening and was annotated as a hypothetical protein in the Rba. sphaeroides genome. Deletion of protein-U resulted in a mutant strain that expressed a much-reduced amount of the dimeric LH1-RC, indicating an important role for protein-U in dimerization of the LH1-RC complex. PufX was located opposite protein-U on the LH1-ring opening, and both its position and conformation differed from that of previous reports of dimeric LH1-RC structures obtained at low-resolution. Twenty-six molecules of the carotenoid spheroidene arranged in two distinct configurations were resolved in the Rba. sphaeroides LH1 and were positioned within the complex to block its pores. Our findings offer a new view of the core photocomplex of Rba. sphaeroides and the connections between structure and function in bacterial photocomplexes in general.","Tani, K.; Nagashima, K. V.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,201660,Manipulating the microbiome alters regenerative outcomes in Xenopus laevis tadpoles via lipopolysaccharide signalling,"Xenopus laevis tadpoles can regenerate functional tails, containing spinal cord, notochord, muscle, fin, blood vessels and nerves, except for a brief refractory period at around one week of age. At this stage, amputation of the tadpoles tail may either result in scarless wound healing, or the activation of a regeneration programme, which replaces the lost tissues. We recently demonstrated a link between bacterial lipopolysaccharides and successful tail regeneration in refractory stage tadpoles, and proposed that this could result from lipopolysaccharides binding to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Here, we have used 16S rRNA sequencing to show that the tadpole skin microbiome is highly variable between sibships and that the community can be altered by raising embryos in the antibiotic gentamicin. Six gram-negative genera, including Delftia and Chryseobacterium, were over-represented in tadpoles that underwent tail regeneration. Lipopolysaccharides purified from a commensal Chryseobacterium spp. XDS4, an exogenous Delftia spp. or Escherichia coli could significantly increase the number of antibiotic-raised tadpoles that attempted regeneration. Conversely, the quality of regeneration was impaired in native-raised tadpoles exposed to the antagonistic lipopolysaccharide of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Editing TLR4 using CRISPR/Cas9 also reduced regeneration quality, but not quantity, at the level of the cohort. However, we found that the editing level of individual tadpoles was a poor predictor of regenerative outcome. In conclusion, our results suggest that variable regeneration in refractory stage tadpoles depends at least in part on the skin microbiome and lipopolysaccharide signalling, but that signalling via TLR4 cannot account for all of this effect.","Chapman, P.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,202263,Asymmetric Structure of the Native Rhodobacter sphaeroides Dimeric LH1-RC Complex,"The light-harvesting-reaction center (LH1-RC) core complex of purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides is characterized by the presence of both a dimeric form and a monomeric form. Following structure determination of the monomeric LH1-RC including its previously unrecognized component designated protein-U (Nat. Commun. 12, 6300, 2021), here we present cryo-EM structures of the dimeric LH1-RC from native Rba. sphaeroides IL106 at 2.75 [A] resolution and from an LH1-RC monomer lacking protein-U ({Delta}U) at 2.64 [A] resolution. The native dimeric core complex reveals many asymmetric features in the arrangement of its two monomeric components including the structural integrity of protein-U, the overall LH1 organization, and the rigidities of the proteins and pigments that form the complex. PufX polypeptides play a critical role in connecting two monomers, with one PufX interacting at its N-terminus with another PufX and an LH1 {beta}-polypeptide in another monomer, in good agreement with biochemical analyses. One of the proteins-U was only partially identified in the dimeric structure, signaling significantly different degrees of disorder in the two monomers. The {Delta}U LH1-RC monomer revealed a half-moon-shaped structure containing 11 - and 10 {beta}-polypeptides (compared with 14 of each in the wild type), indicating a critical role for protein-U in controlling the number of {beta}-subunits required for correct assembly and stabilization of the LH1-RC dimer. The structural features are discussed in relation to the unusual topology of intracytoplasmic photosynthetic membranes and an assembly model proposed for the native Rba. sphaeroides dimeric LH1-RC complex in membranes of wild-type cells.","Tani, K.; Kanno, R.; Kikuchi, R.; Kawamura, S.; Nagashima, K.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,202731,Structural basis for the assembly and electron transport mechanisms of the dimeric photosynthetic RC-LH1 supercomplex,"The reaction center (RC) and light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) form a RC-LH1 core supercomplex that is vital for the primary reactions of photosynthesis in purple photosynthetic bacteria. Some species possess the dimeric RC-LH1 complex with an additional polypeptide PufX, representing the largest photosynthetic complex in anoxygenic phototrophs. However, the details of the architecture and assembly mechanism of the RC-LH1 dimer are unclear. Here we report seven cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of RC-LH1 supercomplexes from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Our structures reveal that two PufX polypeptides are positioned in the center of the S-shaped RC-LH1 dimer, interlocking association between the components and mediating RC-LH1 dimerization. Moreover, we identify a new transmembrane peptide, designated PufY, which is located between the RC and LH1 subunits near the LH1 opening. PufY binds a quinone molecule and prevents LH1 subunits from completely encircling the RC, creating a channel for quinone/quinol exchange. Genetic mutagenesis, cryo-EM structures, and computational simulations enable a mechanistic understanding of the assembly and electron transport pathways of the RC-LH1 dimer and elucidate the roles of individual components in ensuring the structural and functional integrity of the photosynthetic supercomplex.","Cao, P.; Bracun, L.; Yamagata, A.; Christianson, B.; Negami, T.; Zou, B.; Terada, T.; Canniffe, D.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,210783,Cryo-EM structure of the Rhodobaca bogoriensis RC-LH1-PufX dimeric complex at 2.9 A,"The reaction centre-light harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) complex is essential for converting light into proton motive force in photosynthetic bacteria. RC-LH1 is a monomer in most purple bacteria, but in Rhodobacter species, it is a dimer. Its assembly depends on an accessory polypeptide (PufX) and, ultimately, on photosynthetic growth. To date, knowledge on the RC-LH1-PufX structure, where the dimer has two incomplete  C-shaped antenna rings surrounding an RC, is mainly limited to the model organism Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure at 2.9 [A] from Rhodobaca bogorensis strain LBB1. RCs are surrounded by 30 antennas and incorporate protein Y and PufX. RCs are stably connected by PufX, which self-interacts, electrostatically attracts cytochrome c2 (cyt c2) and forms extensive networks with co-factors. This structure underlines coordinated energy transfer in a combinatorial manner, providing a basis to describe bacterial photosynthesis within a dimeric photosynthetic apparatus.","Semchonok, D.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,223934,The development of intracytoplasmic membranes in alphaproteobacteria involves the conserved mitochondrial crista-developing Mic60 protein,"Mitochondrial cristae expand the surface area of respiratory membranes and ultimately allow for the evolutionary scaling of respiration with cell volume across eukaryotes. The discovery of Mic60 homologs among alphaproteobacteria, the closest extant relatives of mitochondria, suggested that cristae might have evolved from bacterial intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs). Here, we investigated the predicted structure and function of alphaproteobacterial Mic60, and a protein encoded by an adjacent gene Orf52, in two distantly related purple alphaproteobacteria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In addition, we assessed the potential physical interactors of Mic60 and Orf52 in R. sphaeroides. We show that the three -helices of mitochondrial Mic60s mitofilin domain, as well as its adjacent membrane-binding amphipathic helix, are present in alphaproteobacterial Mic60. The disruption of Mic60 and Orf52 caused photoheterotrophic growth defects, which are most severe under low light conditions, and both their disruption and overexpression lead to enlarged ICMs in both studied alphaproteobacteria. We also found that alphaproteobacterial Mic60 physically interacts with BamA, the homolog of Sam50, one of the main physical interactors of eukaryotic Mic60. This interaction, responsible for making contact sites at mitochondrial envelopes, has been conserved in modern alphaproteobacteria despite more than a billion years of evolutionary divergence. Our results suggest a role for Mic60 in photosynthetic ICM development and contact site formation at alphaproteobacterial envelopes. Overall, we provide support for the hypothesis that mitochondrial cristae evolved from alphaproteobacterial ICMs, and therefore have improved our understanding of the nature of the mitochondrial ancestor.","Munoz-Gomez, S.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,230821,Formation of sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol by acylation of sulfoquinovosyl glycerol,"Sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG) is a membrane-forming lipid present in photosynthetic organisms as well as in distinct bacteria growing in phosphate-limited environments. Four genes for SQDG biosynthesis were previously identified in Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the operon sqdBDC and sqdA. In this work, we found that SMc02490 of Sinorhizobium meliloti is an SqdA orthologue. Expression of the S. meliloti sqdBDC operon in Escherichia coli results in formation of sulfoquinovosyl glycerol (SQGro), while co-expression of this operon together with smc02490 (sqdA) results in formation of SQDG. Furthermore, SqdA allows for incorporation of exogenous SQGro into SQDG in S. meliloti and in E. coli cultures, suggesting that presence of SqdA in bacteria permit them to use environmental SQGro for the biosynthesis of the membrane lipid SQDG. An in vitro enzymatic assay for the acyltransferase SqdA was developed. Cell-free crude extracts of E. coli expressing sqdA can efficiently convert [35S]-sulfoquinovosyl monoacylglycerol into SQDG using as acyl donor acyl carrier protein. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that this sulfoquinovose acylation pathway for SQDG biosynthesis is delimited to the Hyphomicrobiales (Rhizobiales) and Rhodobacterales orders of Alphaproteobacteria.","Cuevas-Rivas, J.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,29431,The Rhodobacter sphaeroides methionine sulfoxide reductase MsrP can reduce R- and S- diastereomers of methionine sulfoxide from a broad-spectrum of protein substrates.,"Methionine (Met) is prone to oxidation and can be converted to Met sulfoxide (MetO), which exists as R- and S-diastereomers. MetO can be reduced back to Met by the ubiquitous methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) enzymes. Canonical MsrA and MsrB were shown as absolutely stereospecific for the reduction of S- and R-diastereomer, respectively. Recently, the molybdenum-containing protein MsrP, conserved in all gram-negative bacteria, was shown to be able to reduce MetO of periplasmic proteins without apparent stereospecificity in Escherichia coli. Here, we describe the substrate specificity of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides MsrP. Proteomics analysis coupled to enzymology approaches indicate that it reduces a broad spectrum of periplasmic oxidized proteins. Moreover, using model proteins, we demonstrated that RsMsrP preferentially reduces unfolded oxidized proteins and we confirmed that this enzyme, like its E. coli homolog, can reduce both R- and S-diastereomers of MetO with similar efficiency.","Tarrago, L.; Grosse, S.; Siponen, M.

Rhodobacter sphaeroides,39462,Partitioning protein ParP directly links chemotaxis to biofilm dispersal in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,"The recent characterization of partitioning proteins in the localization of chemotaxis signal transduction systems was proposed to have broad implications for polarly-flagellated non-enterobacteriaceae gamma-proteobacteria. These studies showed that the loss of either partitioning protein resulted in equivalent reductions in swimming motility and chemotaxis protein localization and inheritance. However, the role of these chemotaxis partitioning proteins outside of Vibrio spp. remains untested. Our studies on the chemotaxis partitioning proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed an unexpected role for the partitioning protein ParP. While the P. aeruginosa ParC and ParP homologs are needed for wild type swimming motility, the loss of ParP results in a greater swimming defect compared to the parC mutant. Our studies revealed that the Par-like proteins directly interact with each other and the chemotaxis system, and ParP interacts with DipA. Deletion of dipA results in a similar defect in swimming motility as the parP mutant. ParP has an interdependence for polar cluster formation, but not localization, with both CheA and DipA, and CheA cluster formation is partially dependent on ParP. Due to the direct interactions and interdependence of cluster formation of ParP and DipA, and the similar phenotypes of the parP and dipA mutants, further investigation into the role of ParP in biofilm dispersion is warranted.\n\nImportanceImpaired chemotaxis protein cluster formation or inheritance reduces chemotaxis which can have an impact on of the virulence of a bacterium. In some gamma-proteobacteria there are systems in place to ensure that chemotaxis proteins, like chromosomes and plasmids, are localized for optimal chemotaxis and that daughter cells inherit their own clusters for use after cell division. Par-like proteins have been implicated in the partitioning and localization of chemotaxis proteins and the chemotactic ability of Vibrio spp. and Rhodobacter sphaeroides [1-3]. We propose that Par-like proteins can do more than localize chemotaxis proteins to the poles of the cells. In P. aeruginosa, they bring together other key proteins involved in regulating flagellar-based motility, and we propose they function as a critical link between biofilm dispersal and motility.","Reinhardt, J.
